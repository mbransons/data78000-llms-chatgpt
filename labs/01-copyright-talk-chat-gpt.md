# The State of Art, Remix, and Copyright: Evolving Perspectives

## Introduction

The relationship between art, remix culture, and copyright has been a subject of ongoing debate and evolution in the digital age. This essay explores the changing landscape of art, remix, and copyright through the lens of key figures and legal cases. We will delve into the perspectives surrounding artists like Richard Prince and Andy Warhol, the impact of digital platforms like YouTube, the evolving legal interpretations of copyright, and the overarching theme of power in the realm of creative appropriation.

## The First 'Prince' – Richard Prince

### A Genius Trolling: Jerry Saltz's Perspective

The controversy surrounding artist Richard Prince is emblematic of the shifting dynamics in the world of art, remix, and copyright. To delve into this issue, we begin with the observations of Jerry Saltz, a prominent art critic. Saltz has criticized the traditional notions of copyright, emphasizing the need for a more fluid approach to creativity in the digital age. He contends that artists must embrace the idea that images, even digital ones, are materials for artistic expression rather than sacrosanct intellectual property. This sets the stage for the exploration of Richard Prince's controversial works, specifically his 'Canal Zone' series and 'Instagram Paintings.'

### Canal Zone vs. Instagram Paintings: Differing Opinions

Richard Prince's 'Canal Zone' series ignited a legal and ethical debate when it was alleged that he had infringed upon photographer Patrick Cariou's original works. Cariou's portraits of Rastafarians in Jamaica served as the foundation for Prince's collages, raising questions about transformative art and fair use. Prince's defense, rooted in the concept of "appropriation art," sparked divergent opinions among art critics and legal experts. Prince's assertion that he didn't intend to create anything new but rather to present a new context for existing images challenges conventional notions of artistic creation.

## The Real 'Prince' – Warhol and Goldsmith

### Supreme Court's Evolving Perspective

The legal saga involving Andy Warhol and photographer Lynn Goldsmith offers another lens through which to examine the evolving perspective on copyright and transformative art. Warhol's use of Goldsmith's photograph as a reference for his iconic works led to a legal battle that ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court's decision hinged on whether Warhol's use of Goldsmith's image qualified as "fair use." This landmark case prompted art scholars and legal experts to ponder the role of judges as art critics and the significance of an artist's intent in copyright disputes.

### Amicus Briefs and Divided Opinions

The case also attracted amicus briefs from various organizations, highlighting the broader implications for the art and entertainment industries. While some argued in favor of Goldsmith, emphasizing the need to protect copyright holders, others supported the Warhol Foundation, advocating for a more expansive view of fair use. Justice Sotomayor's nuanced perspective on the balance between copyright protection and creativity sheds light on the complexity of these issues.

## The Baby 'Prince' – YouTube

### The Stephanie Lenz Case and Content ID

The emergence of digital platforms like YouTube has transformed the landscape of creative expression and copyright enforcement. The Stephanie Lenz case exemplifies the challenges content creators face when navigating the intersection of fair use and copyright on online platforms. Lenz's video, featuring her child dancing to Prince's song, led to a takedown request by Universal Music Corp. YouTube's implementation of Content ID, a tool designed to identify and manage copyrighted material, raised concerns about the subjective nature of infringement claims.

### Content Creators' Perspectives

Content creators on platforms like YouTube find themselves in a precarious position, where the fear of legal repercussions often discourages them from challenging Content ID claims. The case also underscores the power dynamic between large rightsholders and individual creators. Maria Schneider's class action lawsuit against YouTube highlights the struggle of smaller copyright holders to access and control their intellectual property on digital platforms, ultimately influencing the ongoing discourse surrounding copyright enforcement.

## The Embedded 'Prince'

### The 'Server Test' and Its Challenges

The legal concept known as the 'server test' or 'server rule' plays a pivotal role in determining copyright infringement in the digital realm. The 'server test,' established by the Ninth Circuit, holds that embedding images from external servers constitutes fair use. However, recent developments in the Second Circuit in New York have challenged this precedent, highlighting the divergence in legal interpretations.

### Implications for Art and Copyright

The legal battle over the 'server test' has far-reaching implications for artists, content creators, and the broader creative industry. It raises questions about the boundaries of fair use in the digital age and the impact of embedding images on other sites. The convergence of legal perspectives in the Supreme Court case involving Warhol's art and the 'server test' issue underscores the critical role of the purpose and context of use in determining copyright infringement.

## The 'Prince' of Power

### Reflections on Power in Creative Appropriation

In conclusion, the evolving perspectives on art, remix, and copyright underscore the intricate interplay of creativity, legality, and power. Haley Nahman's insights on cultural appropriation and power imbalances shed light on the ethical considerations that underpin artistic expression. As artists and consumers grapple with the evolving landscape of copyright and remix culture, it becomes increasingly important to balance the protection of intellectual property with the promotion of creativity in an ever-changing digital world. The ongoing debates and legal battles surrounding these issues serve as a testament to the enduring relevance and complexity of art, remix, and copyright in contemporary society.
