“By now, we have to agree that images — even digital ones — are materials, and artists use materials to do what they do. Period. In my way of thinking, too many artists are too wed to woefully outmoded copyright notions - laws that go against them in almost every case.”

“In 2000, a French photographer named Patrick Cariou published “Yes, Rasta,” a book of dramatic black-and-white portraits of Rastafarians set against a lush Jamaican landscape. Eight years later, the insouciant artist Richard Prince debuted his “Canal Zone” series of collages, “

Prince was asked: “Were you trying to create anything with a new meaning or a new message?” He answered: “No.”
Prince quotes “he’s playing the guitar now, it looks like he's playing the guitar, it looks as if he's always played the guitar, that's what my message was.”

“The April 2013 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a lower court’s ruling that Prince’s paintings from his Canal Zone series, shown at Gagosian in 2008, infringed on Patrick Cariou’s original photography and should be destroyed. “

The Warhol Foundation, along with the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, filed briefs in support

“Out of the 30 works, 25 were found to be fair use and five were sent back to the lower court for re-arguing,” New York attorney Sergio Muñoz Sarmiento told A.i.A. by phone. “The judges at the Second Circuit court decided that the case would hinge on whether a reasonable observer would find Prince’s works to have been transformative, and thus protected under fair use law. The question remains, who is a ‘reasonable observer?'”

Supreme court ruling: 'if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings - this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society."

“Donald Graham brought the earliest of the two lawsuits, accusing Prince of violating the copyright on his 1998 photograph "Rastafarian Smoking A Joint," a close-up shot of a shirtless, Jamaican man toking marijuana. Eric McNatt brought the second suit in 2020, arising from Prince’s appropriation of a portrait of Kim Gordon, a friend of Prince and co-founder of the legendary art-rock institution Sonic Youth.”

Prince sought a summary judgement affirming the works fall under fair use, but the judge did not agree allowing the suits to continue.

Court ruling on instagram "Prince did not use plaintiff's photographs as raw material to create a collage or nor did he attempt to obscure the images."

“On commission for Vanity Fair, Warhol used the photograph as a reference, allegedly without Goldsmith’s knowledge of the project. Those illustrations were copyrighted by Warhol and have, since his death in 1987, been sold and reproduced for hundreds of millions of dollars. This, she alleged, was copyright infringement.

In 2017, the Warhol Foundation preemptively sued Goldsmith and, in the years since, the case has made its way through the lower courts, eventually reaching the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, who ruled in 2019 in favor of the Andy Warhol Foundation. Last year, the Appellate Court, which hears appeals and is usually “the last word” in most cases, reversed the Southern District Court’s decision; the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Goldsmith, stating that a judge “should not assume the role of art critic and seek to ascertain the intent behind or meaning of the works at issue.”

The Supreme Court’s decision was expected to hinge on whether the justices deemed Warhol’s use of Goldsmith’s image as “fair use,” as the Warhol Foundation has argued.”

Amicus Briefs filed:
Pro Goldsmith: Indeed, organizations representing those industries have weighed in: The Association of American Publishers, the National Music Publishers’ Association, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Recording Industry Association of America have all filed amicus briefs in support of Goldsmith. The Biden administration is also backing Goldsmith.

Pro Warhol: Supporting the Warhol Foundation are the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation and the Brooklyn Museum, which filed a joint brief.

Sotomayor’s belief is that the artworks are fair use, but the very narrow use of the Warhol image by Conde Naste in 2016 for the exact same purpose that Vanity Fair used one in 1984 and paid Lynn Goldsmith the commercial photographer that the Warhol prints are based on is not fair use.

“She sees a statute “replete with escape valves” that prevent the rights granted to an original creator from stifling follow-on authorship. In the end, she concludes that “the last century of American art, literature, music, and film” show that the existing balance, as the majority sees it “is a powerful engine of creativity.””

“In 2007, Stephanie Lenz uploaded a video to YouTube of her child dancing to Prince’s, “Let’s Go Crazy.” The video itself only lasted for a few seconds and the song was merely background noise therein. Universal Music Corp. (“UMC”) discovered the video and issued a takedown request to YouTube, alleging that the video was infringing its copyright to the song. YouTube issued a subsequent copyright infringement notification to Ms. Lenz, who then filed a lawsuit against UMC pursuant to DMCA § 512(f), which provides that any party who “knowingly materially misrepresents” a takedown request is liable for any damages the allegedly infringing party may occur as a result of the misrepresentative request.”

““the DMCA(1998)’s “safe-harbor” provisions — under which rights holders may request removal of specific, infringing, content from websites which have reproduced the content without authorization. OSPs hosting the websites at issue must promptly honor such takedown requests by removing the copyrighted material.52 Failure to so results in contributory liability.”

“Lenz was a decision of first impression regarding the application of copyright’s “fair use” doctrine to the DMCA’s notice-and-takedown provision. It held that a copyright holder must take fair use into consideration before alleging copyright infringement and issuing a takedown notice to an online service provider (“OSP”).”

But given the ruling determined that a rights holder must only review fair use under a “good faith” standard which is very liberal, rights holders do not actually have to review all four standards and see which apply.

"By creating a private system that dead -ends in the DMCA if disputed, YouTube has leveraged fear of the law to discourage video creators from challenging Content ID."

"YouTube sells Content ID to the entertainment industry as a way of making money off of others' transformative works and that YouTube discourages disputes so it can keep paying large rightsholders."

"Ellis feels like she had to become a fair use 'unexpert' because 'it's never about fair use, it's about beating Content ID."

“On July 2, 2020, Maria Schneider filed a class action lawsuit with Pirate Monitor Ltd. against YouTube arguing that smaller copyright holders are unable to access YouTube's Content ID system which would allow them to publish, monetize, and block infringing material. Schneider and Pirate Monitor claimed that they and other small copyright rights holders were denied access to Content ID, leaving them only the options of self-policing or ignoring infringement of their own property. They also argued that Content ID's weak punishments encourage repeat infringement and that YouTube did not qualify for DMCA safe harbor.[18][19]

Pirate Monitor Ltd voluntarily withdrew from the class action lawsuit on March 8, 2021, while Maria Schneider continued with the case.[20][21] As of October 2022, the case is still being considered and the judge has indicated that there are questions involved that can only be resolved at trial.[22]

“Whether embedding a photograph posted on social media in a news article to illustrate the subject of the photograph is fair use.”
Outcome Preliminary ruling; Fair use not found

In 2018, when Goldman v. Breitbart became the first S.D.N.Y. (second district of New York) court to reject the server test (made by the ninth district in San Francisco 2007), then-Judge Katherine Forrest tried to offer reassurance that “strong defenses to liability” would help mitigate the effects of the court’s ruling and that “numerous viable claims should not follow.” But in McGucken, the court denied summary judgment, not only as to the server test, but on Newsweek’s implied license and fair use defenses too. Not surprisingly, the case settled less than three weeks later, once again dashing any hope that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals might step in and right the ship.

Thumbnails of images created by Google and hosted on their servers. Embedding of the larger image from an external server.

This is the usage of images by Google was disputed in case Perfect 10, Inc v. Amazon.com and Google.com. In 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit oversaw the case involving the copyright infringement claim against Amazon.com, Inc. and Google, Inc., by the magazine publisher Perfect 10, Inc. The court held that framing and hyperlinking of original images for use in an image search engine constituted a fair use of Perfect 10's images because the use was highly transformative, and thus not an infringement of the magazine's copyright ownership of the original images.

This ruling became the foundation of the ‘server rule’ which effectively made embedding of images on other sites fair use. It’s important to note that this was a Ninth Circuit ruling and should be considered in the context of the Second Circuit in New York which is starting to push against this ‘auto-fair use’ doctrine.

"The court held that framing and hyperlinking of original images for use in an image search engine constituted fair use..."

“The class action claims included direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement. The complaint did not provide the damages amount sought, but rather requested actual or statutory damages, an injunction preventing Instagram from sharing copyrighted images as well as assisting others in doing so, the creation and implementation of a tracking tool to assist copyright holders in protecting their works, disgorgement of profits obtained from the infringement, as well as other costs, relief, and fees.”

“Instagram filed a motion to dismiss the claim based upon the ‘Server Test,’ a rule from the Ninth Circuit meant to avoid liability for those who display copyrighted works without storing the works on their own servers.”

Recently tested, the embedding an image was held fair use by the Ninth Circuit (West Coast) which created the server ruling in 2007.

“In a dispute over a video of a starving polar bear, a Manhattan federal court on Friday rejected Sinclair Broadcasting's argument that it and its affiliates couldn't have infringed the copyright in Paul Nicklen's video because they only embedded it on their websites from Instagram or Facebook.”

“Rakoff said the server rule is "contrary to the text and legislative history of the Copyright Act," which "defines 'to display' as 'to show a copy of' a work, not 'to make and then show a copy of the copyrighted work.’”

“Rakoff said that under the test, "a photographer who promotes his work on Instagram or a filmmaker who posts her short film on YouTube surrenders control over how, when, and by whom their work is subsequently shown -- reducing the display right, effectively, to the limited right of first publication that the [Act] rejects."”

Brittain, Blake. “Manhattan Judge Rejects ‘server Test’ for Internet Copyright Infringement.” Reuters, 30 July 2021, www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/manhattan-judge-rejects-server-test-internet-copyright-infringement-2021-07-30.

But back on the East Coast the Second Circuit of New York is pushing back against the server ruling. This case and the one on slide 33 both made initial rulings in-favor of the suing photographers that the sites were not using embedded photos fairly. But both cases settled out of court, I would imagine because the websites in question probably don’t want the ‘server rule’ to truly be re-litigated.

"Rakoff said the server rule is 'contrary to the text and legislative history of the Copyright Act,' which 'defines "to display" as "to show a copy of" a work, not "to make and then show a copy of the copyrighted work."" "it cannot be that the copyright act grants authors an exclusive right to display their work publicly only if that public is not online."

Connecting back to the Supreme Court ruling that found Conde Naste’s use of the Warhol print based on the Goldsmith photo to be infringing, because of how it was used.

This seems to be where the courts are heading (well maybe not the ninth circuit), which is if the usage is of a similar purpose to what a paid purpose would be, then it’s infringing.

"The Court concluded that "if an original work and a secondary use share the same or highly similar purposes, and the secondary use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is likely to weigh against fair use, absent some other justification for copying."

"Power is at the center of the conversation on cultural appropriation, too. As Antonia Opiah wrote for Teen Vogue: “[C]ultural appropriation only exists because the world isn’t fair. Opportunity isn’t really as equal as we think it is and people are unfairly characterized, which has consequences. Cultural appropriation would be the cultural exchange everybody wants and loves IF it were occurring on an even playing field, but it’s not.”"

"I wonder what role power plays in Saltz’ view of art. Art and commerce can only be separate in an ideal world, one that’s far from ours. The reality is, it’s easier for some people to make money off their art than others. And that’s often because of an unfair playing field. Power matters, right? Below each of the Instagram images Prince chose, you can see a comment he left on it. If that’s not a literal comment on power, I don’t know what is."

"So where does it become an artist’s responsibility to consider power imbalances when he or she steals, imitates, appropriates? If it’s a choice between limiting an artist’s point of view (thus potentially making all art suffer) and stealing from another person, where is the line drawn? Artists, consumers of it and everyone in between, what do you think? I’m genuinely asking."
