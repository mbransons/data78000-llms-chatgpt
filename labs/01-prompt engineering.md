### Part 1 Define your problem

### In the form of a Shakespearen sonnet, describe the current issues of us office of copyright assessing the rule of 'human authorship' with respect to AI generated art and text.

Upon the stage of copyright's shifting tide,
A quandary vast, where human minds doth dwell,
In US Office of Copyright, they bide,
To ponder 'pon AI's creation's spell.

For art and text, where human hands once wrought,
Now AI's muse, its brush, its quill, they claim,
Doth "human authorship" stand as it ought,
Or doth new laws and standards seek to frame?

In silicon hearts, a spark of brilliance gleams,
Yet questions rise, and boundaries must be set,
Can algorithms dream, create, and scheme,
As artists, writers, poets oft beget?

To navigate this realm of murky art,
We seek a balance fair, a brand new start.

### Part 2: The Chat interface

1. See above.

2. #### Rework this sonnet to include US Copyright's Office's denying a copyright to "A Recent Entrance to Paradise" by Stephen Thaler

Upon the stage of copyright's shifting tide,
A quandary vast, where human minds doth dwell,
In US Office of Copyright, they bide,
To ponder 'pon AI's creation's spell.

For art and text, where human hands once wrought,
Now AI's muse, its brush, its quill, they claim,
Doth "human authorship" stand as it ought,
Or doth new laws and standards seek to frame?

In silicon hearts, a spark of brilliance gleams,
Yet questions rise, and boundaries must be set,
Can algorithms dream, create, and scheme,
As artists, writers, poets oft beget?

Yet 'A Recent Entrance to Paradise' denied,
Stephen Thaler's work, AI's art belied.

#### Have the entire sonnet focus on people's reactions to the artwork 'A Recent Entrance to Paradise' being denied copyright.

Upon the stage, a drama's tale we find,
In US Office of Copyright's decree,
"A Recent Entrance to Paradise" denied,
A ripple through the art world's tapestry.

For Stephen Thaler's work, AI's masterpiece,
Denied the copyright's protective grace,
The art community's dismay shall cease,
As questions of AI's place in art embrace.

With furrowed brows and voices raised in strife,
Debate ignites, opinions take their flight,
Does art by algorithms hold a life?
Or in the realm of humans, claim its right?

In 'Paradise' denied, a fervent cry,
As AI and art in tension stand awry.

3. Using notes from a recent talk I gave on art, copyright, and remix, I wrote the following prompt and added all the notes from the '01-copyright-talk-notes.md' file.

   Write a 6000 word academic essay on the state of art, remix and copyright. Be sure to include the following evolving perspectives. Do not list examples, weave them together into a complete narrative with the following section headings:

   The first 'Prince' – Richard Prince (this section should focus on the differing opinions on 'Canal Zone' vs. his 'Instagram Paintings.' Jerry Saltz opinion should be used to start this section)

   The real 'Prince' – Warhol and Goldsmith (this section should focus on the evolving perspective of supreme court on this work of warhol and the history)

   The baby 'Prince' – Youtube (this section should focus on the Stephanie Lenz case as well as the resulting creation of Content ID and how only a subjective belief of infringement is necessary. give perspectives of content creators and how they navigate content id)

   The embedded 'Prince' (this section should focus on the supreme court's 'server rule' or 'server test' which affirmed the Ninth Circuit court's decision and how the Second Circuit is pushing back compared to the Ninth Circuit which continues to uphold the 'server test')

   The 'Prince' of Power (this section should be a short conclusion which comments reflecting Haley Nahman's thoughts on power when considering copying work, copyright, and remix.)

The resulting essay is in '01-copyright-talk-chat-gpt.md' which misses the mark conflating a number of the court cases and issues. So for a test I attempted to rework the section on 'The first 'Prince' using specific notes to target specfic paragraphs.

    - rewrite the "Canal Zone vs. Instagram Paintings: Differing Opinions" section to include a second paragraph about the current legal case surround the 'Instagram Paintings.
    - Try that second paragraph again on the 'Instagram Paintings' and summarize/reference (specific notes added)
    - Rewrite the 'canal zone' paragraphs and summarize/reference the following: (specific notes added)
    - Weave the rewritten paragraphs together with minor edits: (added GPT created sets of paragraphs from the previous two prompts)
