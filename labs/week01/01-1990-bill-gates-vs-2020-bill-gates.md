Verse 1: 1990 Bill Gates
Yo, it's the OG Bill Gates, here to set the stage,
Back in '90 when I was all the rage,
I co-founded Microsoft, made the world bow,
Revolutionized tech, yeah, I showed 'em how.

I paved the way for the PC, made it known,
Gave the world Windows, now it's widely flown,
MS-DOS, Word, Excel, they all my creations,
Building an empire, no room for imitations.

Verse 2: 2020 Bill Gates
Hold up, hold up, it's the modern-day Gates,
Still making moves, innovating at high rates,
1990 was cool, but I've taken it far,
From software to vaccines, I'm reaching for the stars.

I'm fighting global issues, climate change in sight,
With the Gates Foundation, making things right,
No longer just a tech guy, I'm a philanthropist,
Making a difference, yeah, that's where my focus is.

Verse 3: 1990 Bill Gates
You're talking big, but can you back it up?
I built an empire, you're just trying to interrupt,
No denying your foundation's doing some good,
But I'm the pioneer, misunderstood.

I brought computers to the masses, made it accessible,
Windows made it easy, that's undeniable,
I may be old school, but I'm still a legend,
1990 Bill Gates, forever present.

Verse 4: 2020 Bill Gates
You're right, you paved the way, I won't deny,
But I'm building on your legacy, reaching the sky,
Technology's evolved, and so have I,
From coding to saving lives, that's no lie.

I may not be the OG, but I'm here to stay,
Using my wealth and knowledge in a different way,
So, 1990 Bill Gates, respect is due,
But 2020 Bill Gates, making dreams come true.

Verse 5: 1990 Bill Gates
I hear you talk, but where's the innovation?
You're focused on vaccines, but what about creation?
I brought the world together, connected us all,
You're fighting diseases, but can you stand tall?

Verse 6: 2020 Bill Gates
Creation and innovation, I've done my share,
But now it's time to address the world's despair,
Fighting for those who can't fight for themselves,
Using my platform to bring hope, that's what compels.

The rap battle's over, both Bills had their say,
1990 Gates paved the way, no delay,
But 2020 Gates, he's a different breed,
Balancing tech and philanthropy, fulfilling a noble deed.
