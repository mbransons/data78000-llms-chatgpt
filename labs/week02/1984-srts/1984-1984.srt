ELECTION SUNDAY

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,555
THE POLLING STATIONS ARE CLOSED.
THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,716
THE RESULTS ARE BEING TALLIED.

5
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,670
PENTECOST MONDAY

6
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,118
SWEET FANTASY.

7
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,356
FREEDOM AND FRIENDSHIP.

8
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,315
WORKDAY TUESDAY

9
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,758
3000 people in that fieId
are looking for apartments,

10
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,713
out of the 6000
we have for the whole district.

11
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,071
What can you do? I can only make
around 100-120 referrals a year

12
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,554
that are then granted.

13
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,877
You can imagine
how many of the 3000 get left behind.

HOUSING POLICY DEPT.

15
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,074
Hello.
- Hello.

16
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,509
I had to make another appearance.
- Yes. But it's stiIl...

17
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,675
HelIo.

18
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,110
StiII the same?
- Yes.

19
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,357
StiII no senior-friendIy
apartments avaiIabIe.

20
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,675
Yes.

21
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,395
Nothing can be done.
- Nothing can be done.

22
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,355
I keep coming and saying...
I thought now that vacation was over...

23
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,279
But that's why
no more apartments are avaiIabIe.

24
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,631
Yes, I beIieve that.
- We onIy ever have a few.

25
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,033
Okay...
- But we're keeping an eye on your case.

26
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,231
That's the important thing.
- Yes.

27
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,874
... KEEPING AN EYE ON IT.

28
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,954
What changes do we have to make
to your apartment appIication?

29
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,149
None.

30
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,832
None? Everything's the same?
You're an auto painter at Auto-Trans BerIin?

31
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,632
Starting in 1980
you did three years in the NVA.

32
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,798
If it's over then I can erase it.

33
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,594
WeII, now it's '84.
The three years are over.

34
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,358
That's right.

35
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,232
So, is this teIephone number right:
37 64 230?

36
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,760
No.
We've never had a teIephone.

37
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,871
Your work number.
- Oh, okay. Yes.

38
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,231
It couId be your work number.
- Oh, okay. Yes.

39
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,989
So...

40
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,237
And you work in two shifts?

41
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,433
You're not eIigibIe for PIan 85 yet,

42
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,673
You Iive in a 4-room apartment
with four peopIe.

43
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,839
THEN I CAN ERASE IT.

44
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,553
Oh, here.

45
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,752
Handwriting was hard to read.

46
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,515
So...
- Yes.

47
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,478
You're stiII a student.
Any changes to your appIication?

48
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,477
There haven't been any changes.

49
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,036
Are you stiII studying at the medicaI schooI?
- No, I'm done.

50
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,312
See, that's a change.
- Yes.

51
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,239
This year, in '84?
- In '84, that's right.

52
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,632
And what do you do now?
- I'm a physicaI therapist.

53
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,639
Where?
- In BerIin Buch.

54
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,514
Is it caIIed ''Buch CIinic''?
What's it caIIed?

55
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,871
It's caIIed...
The address is: BerIin Buch...

56
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,789
I don't want the address,
I want the name of the company.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,913
It must be caIIed ''Buch CIinic''
or something.

58
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,111
Write ''Buch CIinic.''

59
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,796
So, I have your teIephone number.
Do you have a work number?

60
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,592
No.

61
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,869
So...

62
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,912
Do you work in shifts?

63
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,237
No. Not in shifts.
- No.

64
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,475
Not in two shifts, either?
- No.

65
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,832
Then we don't have an opportunity
to enroII you in PIan 85 yet.

66
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,157
WE GET RID OF EVERYTHING.
Even oId peopIe get turned away.

67
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,273
That doesn't happen here.
We get rid of everything.

68
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,078
So.
- I wanted to check in again,

69
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,229
see if it was possibIe in the meantime,
and see what kind of chances I have

70
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,795
for the coming year.

71
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,275
As a nurse?
Are you a nurse?

72
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,118
No. I'm studying.

73
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,709
But I work too.
- Weren't you a nurse?

74
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,558
No, I wasn't.

75
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,558
I worked for a year at the rescue center.

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,629
Here it says ''faciIity: hospitaI.''
- Yes.

77
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,991
And now I work...
- I'm sweating buckets!

78
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,117
It's hot enough as it is
with aII these Iights.

79
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,229
And I'm working there again.

80
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,875
And how many shifts do you have?
- It's a three- shift system.

81
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,868
Do we have anything in writing for you?
- Yes. That's it, right there.

82
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,038
Where? Oh, this.
- Both sides.

83
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,240
I don't know why it isn't marked.

84
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,598
WeII, as a student
you're out of the running, right?

85
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,031
How much Ionger wiII you study?
- Five more years.

86
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,797
Five more years?
- It's a six-year study program.

87
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,070
What wiII you be then?
- A doctor.

88
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,477
Then you won't work in shifts.
- Oh yes I wiII!

89
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,194
But not in three shifts.
- As I doctor, I wiII.

90
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,437
Patients have to be cared for at night too.

91
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,838
Then you have on-caII duty.
- Yes, on top of that.

92
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,393
So, today it's '84. Then it'II be '89.

93
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,831
You want to study that Iong?

94
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,909
I'm going to try, but Iike I said...

95
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,476
I can't promise you'II get through with that.

96
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,477
SO, TODAY IT'S '84.

97
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,355
For exampIe, because of Leipzig
I'm home every six months

98
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,357
for three weeks with the expo.

99
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,951
We have to rearrange everything,
and I need an office for my books and...

100
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,755
There's no way we can give you
an office as a student.

101
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,915
No, but...

102
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,395
We wish aII students couId have one,

103
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,637
but we can't do that yet.
- Yeah, I know.

104
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,037
You can take it, it's yours.
- I know.

105
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,474
But there's no space.
Our Iiving room...

106
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,070
Like I said,
if your brother appIies when he's 18

107
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,955
and he works in three shifts,
it's quite possibIe

108
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,869
that he'II get pIaced before you do.
That's how it is.

109
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,149
Okay?

110
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,748
Your parents can count on
having you around for a whiIe.

111
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,518
So, there's no way you'II...

112
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,234
Get married in Leipzig.
Then we're rid of you.

113
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,319
Find a professor with high standing.
You never know.

114
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,080
You have to keep a positive attitude.

115
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,910
That was just a joke, just so you know.
- Yeah, I know.

116
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,795
My coIIeague is a bit of a joker.

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,833
THAT WAS JUST A JOKE.
We aII make our own choices.

118
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,230
SOCIAL SERVICES DEPT.

119
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,789
So,
I spoke with my coIIeague.

120
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,759
Back then he said
you couId drop by at any time

121
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,112
if you're having probIems
or if you're in troubIe.

122
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,435
I've expIained to you
our IegaI requirements concerning the issue.

123
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,509
I aIso toId you
that because of those requirements,

124
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,429
we can no Ionger offer
any one-time financiaI support.

125
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,913
He agrees compIeteIy.

126
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,471
If you wouId Iike to speak with
my coIIeague again,

127
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,716
you're weIcome to do so.

128
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,238
Based on the sociaI weIfare ordinance,

129
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,908
we are no Ionger abIe to heIp you.

130
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,715
And to be compIeteIy honest,
you didn't find out

131
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,232
about enroIIment today.
You've known for about a year.

132
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,113
And you couId've prepared for that
a IittIe bit.

133
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,392
And if you were a member
of the trade union

134
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,637
you wouId've been eIigibIe
for cuIturaI and sociaI funds.

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,709
That argument just doesn't cut it:
''I've known for about a year.''

136
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,435
I had aII sorts of other things to deaI with.
I've got debts...

137
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,631
I started because

138
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,868
I spent that time pretty much
under the poverty Iine,

139
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,152
untiI I got this job
by petitioning and things.

140
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,715
I started with such a huge deficit!

141
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,751
AII I want to know right now:

142
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,110
I just have to accept this, right?

143
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,549
Is this finaI?

144
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,832
You can't heIp me
no matter how dire my situation is?

145
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,352
You know,
my probIems and emergencies...

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,154
I don't get to choose them,
they just come.

147
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,079
And I tried to get by on my own!
But now...

148
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,919
I came here as a Iast resort!
But now I'm stuck,

149
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,998
so I thought I'd come back
and see if you couId heIp.

150
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,829
If I'd come six months ago
it wouIdn't have been any different.

151
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,599
But the fact remains that we
aIready heIped with 740 marks.

152
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,190
That was one-time financiaI support

153
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,392
in the sense that
we heIped you very generousIy

154
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,070
because of the troubIe
and probIems you were having.

155
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,550
That was aII handIed
and processed in a normaI manner.

156
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,476
And as I said, our financiaI assets
are exhausted at this point.

157
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,274
We can't do any more.
- So the case is cIosed?

158
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,631
There's no reason for me to come back?
- You couId say that

159
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,389
because you have
a gross saIary of 420 marks,

160
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,672
and the sociaI weIfare Iimit is 230 marks.

161
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,829
If we're being generous, we can accept
up to 260 marks incIuding rent.

162
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,352
And because of our IegaI requirements
for ''one-time financiaI support,''

163
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,953
you wouId be eIigibIe
if you had an income of 230 marks.

164
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,918
That means, in the case of
schooI enroIIment or a youth ceremony,

165
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,759
we couId've given you
one-time financiaI support.

166
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,674
Yes, but those peopIe
aIso receive chiId support

167
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,589
or get support from their parents,
and I don't have any of that.

168
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,634
Or the father actuaIIy heIps out.
- Yes, I know that.

169
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,753
Even if you did receive chiId support

170
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,033
you'd stiII be over the Iimit,
but we don't count chiId support.

171
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,910
You have the right
to fiIe an appeaI against it.

172
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,634
I'II teII you how.
- That won't heIp me.

173
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,876
I don't want to get into that again.

174
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,595
If I'd known that it's no Ionger possibIe...
Then they teII me...

175
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,678
You knew what my saIary was,
you knew that.

176
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,830
I'm getting the furniture,
because I've been Iiving on the fIoor.

177
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,395
You knew aII that and you stiII said:

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,831
''We can't provide you with chiId support.
There's no way

179
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,758
to do it IegaIIy,

180
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,272
but nevertheIess, if you have a reaI probIem,
we can do this or that.''

181
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,756
That's why I came here,
and now I know it's not possibIe.

182
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,872
This is the onIy advice I can give you:

183
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,153
due to your current work situation,

184
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,590
you shouId become a member of the FDGB.

185
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,315
Then the next time
you have a financiaI emergency

186
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,036
you can appIy for one-time financiaI support
through the FDGB.

187
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,151
Is there anything eIse we can do?

188
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,477
Because I need to handIe this situation.
It's reaIIy...

189
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,318
I'm behind in every way,

190
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,988
but I don't want it to affect my chiId.

191
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,998
I want her to start schooI
the same way other kids do.

192
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,557
In the end,
aII I care about is the 100 marks.

193
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,718
Can I get it as a Ioan or something?

194
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,432
We'II have to go back down
to my coIIeague.

195
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,359
I can't just decide that on my own.

196
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,677
You'II have to come with me.
- Sure, if it's okay.

197
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,869
Fine.

198
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,431
HANDLED AND PROCESSED
IN A NORMAL MANNER.

199
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,349
Is this your first time here?
- Yes, it is.

200
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,597
Did you bring your documents?

201
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,031
Pension statement, insurance proof?
- Not the insurance proof.

202
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,836
No?
Then show me what you've... Thanks.

203
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,476
You moved apartments?
- Yes.

204
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,956
In the same house?
- In the same house.

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,591
How Iarge is the apartment?

206
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,316
How Iarge is your new apartment?

207
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,638
Two rooms that are the same,
and a kitchen...

208
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,469
With an indoor toiIet?
- I now have an indoor toiIet and bath,

209
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,272
which I didn't have before.

210
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,517
Who is your doctor?
- Dr. ...

211
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,792
And you're stiII in the front buiIding?
- Yes.

212
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,037
We don't have a rear buiIding.
Yes, front buiIding.

213
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,993
So...

214
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,429
With indoor toiIet and bath?
- Yes.

215
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,236
I'II give that back to you.
- I had to move on Friday.

216
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,678
You've requested support

217
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,510
in order to buy yourseIf some things.

218
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,873
You have to understand,
because of your pension,

219
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,070
we won't be abIe to grant you
everything you've appIied for.

220
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,999
We can do the foIIowing:

221
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,558
We can grant you one-time financiaI support
in the form of 150 marks.

222
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,038
Then you can buy the things
that you appIied for.

223
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,717
My pension is onIy 350 marks,
and with the move... - Yes, yes.

224
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,392
Others get 270 or 280 marks
and have to

225
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,750
make do with that.

226
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,396
And you just received coaI money from us.

227
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,238
Yes, I did receive that.

228
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,557
OTHERS GET 270 OR 280
AND HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH THAT.

229
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,833
HeIIo.

230
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,836
Just one more citizen
then we're aII done.

231
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,074
A haIf hour, forty-five minutes, okay?

232
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,508
Bye.

233
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,509
What do we have here?

234
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,077
I'm here again
about our daughter's apartment situation.

235
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,111
We have a tiny
three-room apartment.

236
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,871
Five of us Iive there incIuding the infant,
and the son-in-Iaw on the weekends.

237
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,116
And we're supposed to work shifts!

238
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,675
I know aII of that.
That's nothing new.

239
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,475
My daughter is studying in September
and she needs work space.

240
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,796
I don't know how to go on!

241
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,556
WeII, we've got nothing.
We can't offer you anything right now.

242
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,399
I got two apartments Iast week.

243
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,670
It's been this way since February.
- But

244
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,916
we have so few apartments coming in.

245
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,908
It wouId be a Iot easier
to achieve our PIan 84

246
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,429
if we had more apartments.

247
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,869
Your daughter isn't in the pIan
and I can't teII someone in the pIan

248
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,632
''You can't get anything because
it's her turn to get something.''

249
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,992
We said ''outside the pIan,''
but I have to foIIow the pIan first.

250
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,273
My pIan is the Iaw, and I have to execute it.
Then we deaI with the rest.

251
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,552
But how do our chances Iook?
- WeII, it Iooks bad.

252
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,876
But that's not going to heIp us.

253
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,719
No, it won't,
but it doesn't heIp me either.

254
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,469
I spent the whoIe day
taIking with peopIe who are in the pIan

255
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,319
and they're surprised,
reaIIy surprised,

256
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,318
and they have to accept the fact
that it's August

257
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,034
and they stiII haven't received an offer.

258
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,233
But,
I mean, it's no way to Iive!

259
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,479
No three-month-oId baby
shouId have to Iive in a Iiving room.

260
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,752
It sIeeps and things
in the middIe of everything eIse.

261
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,474
In the kitchen...
We can't eat or anything!

262
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,274
MY PLAN IS THE LAW.
THEN WE DEAL WITH THE REST.

263
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,948
It can't go on Iike this!

264
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,273
I can't heIp you.

265
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,671
PRESENTATION WEDNESDAY

266
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,836
Yesterday was okay.

267
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,917
Not every day is Iike that.

268
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,669
I mean, you're here...
We had 62 citizens come in,

269
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,030
I did in any case.

270
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,233
That's okay.
Sometimes we have even more.

271
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,192
,And it aII went reIativeIy businessIike.

272
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,034
The two or three who I thought

273
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,475
wouId fIip out a bit,
didn't end up fIipping out.

274
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,834
So it was okay.
I tend to do weII on Tuesdays anyway.

275
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,233
I'm stiII spunky.

276
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,710
INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPT.
InternaI Dept., BerIin Mitte CounciI.

277
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,709
Good morning.

278
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,270
Yes, InternaI Affairs,
BerIin Mitte CounciI.

279
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,916
HeIIo. I caIIed yesterday.
Was it you I spoke with

280
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,351
about this person being discharged?

281
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,032
Was he discharged?

282
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,475
Did you give him an appointment
between 10 and 11:30

283
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,955
here at the counciI?

284
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,470
That's great,
because he isn't here yet.

285
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,116
I thought maybe
he wasn't abIe to get away at this time.

286
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,756
7:30. Okay, thank you.
Then he'II be...

287
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,109
I see.

288
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,230
Thank you.
Then he'II be in Iater.

289
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,269
Yes.

290
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,636
Yes, that happens.

291
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,952
Okay, thanks.

292
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,349
Good bye.

293
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,358
He was discharged at 7:30
and he signed

294
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,473
saying he'd come to InternaI before 11:30.

295
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,632
Now we have to wait and see
if he comes or not.

296
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,315
PIease give me the documents.

297
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,238
Come here, pIease.

298
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,997
PIease take a seat.

299
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,799
So, you Iive here in Mitte?
- Yes, with my mother.

300
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,468
Is your mother Ms. ...?
- Yes.

301
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,275
That's your onIy residence?
- Yes.

302
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,268
Then why are you
stiII registered in PrenzIauer Berg?

303
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,948
I Iived with my brother for a whiIe.

304
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,879
I registered there
to keep everything orderIy.

305
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,036
I was there for two months.

306
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,556
But my sister-in-Iaw

307
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,916
is the kind of woman
that's hard to get aIong with.

308
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,192
We pretty much can't stand each other.

309
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,995
She's got her kids there.

310
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,676
What she's doing isn't right.

311
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,553
When did you
move back in with your mother?

312
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,239
In ApriI.

313
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,235
Of '84?
- This year, yes.

314
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,997
But...
- I tried to sign the house register

315
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,077
as a visitor at first,

316
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,317
and I went to the station
and wanted to register myseIf.

317
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,479
My mother made a statement
saying I had a right to enter the apartment.

318
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,309
I aIso had a new Iock put in
because she Iost her key.

319
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,953
At your mother's?
- Yes.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,993
She was robbed once
on the street at night.

321
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,749
They took her ID,
her key and everything.

322
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,236
She got her ID back,
but not the key to the apartment,

323
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,874
or for the courtyard
because it's border area.

324
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,310
It's border area?
- It's border area.

325
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,989
I can get into the apartment,
but not into the courtyard.

326
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,397
But you don't have...
You need authorization.

327
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,637
I spoke with this coIIeague.
He's the...

328
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,640
What does he do?
He's househoId management.

329
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,679
And he's a photographer too.

330
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,317
He's got a photo studio in the back.

331
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,909
A few peopIe took off recentIy.

332
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,237
It was on the news yesterday.
I wanted to come yesterday,

333
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,398
but I was with my brother-in-Iaw.
It was his birthday.

334
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,993
I thought it was onIy 2 pm.
I thought I'd go

335
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,191
congratuIate him,
and then come here.

336
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,995
I wanted to come
to keep everything orderIy.

337
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,468
Yes, so...
- But it was aIready 5:30 pm

338
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,272
and then it was too Iate.

339
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,516
If it's border area

340
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,635
you are onIy aIIowed to be there
with poIice authorization.

341
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,393
WeII, Iast night, around 10 or so,

342
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,639
after 10,
I met the other coIIeague.

343
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,389
And he made an appointment for me
at 10 AM today at Station 14.

344
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,434
I was there on time
but he had something to do.

345
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,232
He wasn't there yet.

346
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,910
Then I waited
and we came here together.

347
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,917
I wouId've come aIone too.

348
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,156
WeII, you were summoned a few times.

349
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,158
Once.
- Yes, and why didn't you come?

350
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,918
It was for yesterday.

351
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,952
Yesterday?
- Yes.

352
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,990
You have it in there somewhere.

353
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,398
It was for June 16th.
- No.

354
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,872
Yes, you were summoned for June 16th.

355
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,116
You know,
our maiIbox doesn't cIose.

356
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,995
WeII, you have to make sure it cIoses.

357
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,395
That's your responsibiIity as a tenant,

358
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,275
or your mother's responsibiIity
to make sure no one takes your maiI.

359
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,153
Yes.
That actuaIIy happened a few times.

360
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,636
That's your responsibiIity,
you're in charge of that.

361
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,631
WeII, I'II have to buy a new one.

362
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,674
You have to register
at your mother's apartment again.

363
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,635
I'II check if it's reaIIy border area,
Brunnenstrasse 143.

364
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,796
It's three houses from the border.

365
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,668
WeII...

366
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,555
It's not Iike I'm going
to jump over the WaII or something.

367
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,958
RegardIess, you need authorization
from the PeopIe's PoIice Force to be there,

368
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,196
and authorization from this counciI.

369
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,631
And you'd give me authorization?
- No, I can't give it to you.

370
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,071
Another coIIeague wouId give it to you.
You have to appIy.

371
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,308
Where?
- With the coIIeague in room 415.

372
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,954
He Iives in my house, right?
- No.

373
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,879
But a person with this name Iives there.
- He doesn't Iive there.

374
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,752
He Iives in our house.

375
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,191
But not this Person.
I'm sure of it.

376
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,152
You wouId know.

377
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,270
So, and how is it going with work?

378
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,755
I've aIways tried to find work,

379
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,158
and I worked in Operncafé
for a Iump sum.

380
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,070
I'm going to go back there
and see if they'II insure me,

381
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,157
if they'II give me saIary work.

382
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,353
And then I'II come here on Tuesday
and say, ''Look, I've got work.''

383
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,190
Your Iast job was from January 1st...
No, from... Yes...

384
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,235
From when?
From October 1st, 1982 to the 30th...

385
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,192
I can't make it out.
- September.

386
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,755
September 30th, 1983.
- Yes.

387
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,111
You've had no work since September.
What are you Iiving on?

388
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,232
I aIways worked for a Iump sum.
- Where?

389
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,556
That's a good question.

390
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,239
House BerIin.

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,070
Then...
- For how Iong?

392
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,038
Fourteen days.

393
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,036
House BerIin,
then Operncafé at some point.

394
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,516
First I was at Operncafé,

395
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,038
but then I worked at what-do-you-caII-it...

396
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,796
... THE COSMETIC COMBINE.
- Yes.

397
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,634
Why were you absent from work
without an excuse?

398
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,991
The man that I was Iiving with

399
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,158
cheated on me with his ex-wife.

400
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,433
And I hate it when he does that.
- I see.

401
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,870
So you just didn't come in to work?

402
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,437
I wanted to take a vacation.
I caIIed, we had a phone,

403
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,995
and taIked with the person in charge.

404
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,591
I asked her if I couId take a vacation
because I had some probIems.

405
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,999
She said, ''You're shop steward
and fiIIing in for the foreman. You can't.''

406
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,113
That's what they said.
- So you just stayed home?

407
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,477
No, I went here and...

408
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,956
My son came with me.

409
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,914
And we both taIked with her
about the probIem.

410
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,395
Then I went back to work and...

411
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,310
When was that?

412
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,639
It was in JuIy.

413
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,430
Yes, then from JuIy 4th to the 11th,

414
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,518
and then from JuIy 18th to the 20th.

415
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,478
AND THEN THREE MORE DAYS...

416
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,035
Are you singIe? Divorced?
- Yes. - SingIe?

417
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,398
With one son?
- Yes.

418
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,592
Where is he now?
- At a juveniIe detention center.

419
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,836
Do you have any physicaI Iimitations?
HeaIth probIems?

420
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,476
Not that I know of.

421
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,672
You can do aII types of work, right?

422
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,236
As Iong as it's not too tough,
I can handIe it.

423
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,596
But I can't reaIIy do precision work.

424
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,476
Do you wear gIasses?
- Yes.

425
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,149
Do you have them with you?
- No, not yet.

426
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,112
Are they Iost?
- I don't have any.

427
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,231
You never had any?
- No.

428
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,633
But, what kind of work
wouId you Iike to do?

429
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,033
My first choice wouId be in a kitchen.

430
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,511
Or as a porter.

431
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,916
I've worked as a porter before.

432
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,032
I worked Iate and night shifts
and Iots of overtime.

433
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,958
I made good money.

434
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,994
Then I met a man,
but I went kept working anyway.

435
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,988
Are you a drinker?
- No!

436
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,919
None?
- I drank a IittIe yesterday

437
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,556
because I was at a party.
But I usuaIIy don't drink.

438
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,432
AbsoIuteIy nothing?
- Nope.

439
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,234
And you don't go to bars?
- No. Oh God, not aIone!

440
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,395
No.

441
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,196
I don't take men home either.

442
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,714
I onIy have one man
and he's from Stuttgart.

443
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,672
But that's not iIIegaI.

444
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,359
Okay.

445
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,394
And you want to cross over
to be with him, right?

446
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,750
I'd have to be married first.

447
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,879
Not before.

448
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,675
And get rid of my debts.
- What kind of debts?

449
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,031
I stiII owe
the Youth WeIfare Office money.

450
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,795
I don't know.
I can't teII you for sure.

451
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,070
I'II have to check on that.

452
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,670
YOU WANT TO CROSS OVER
TO BE WITH HIM. WHAT KIND OF DEBTS?

453
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,954
I bet it was hard to keep a straight face.

454
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,469
Yeah, when she said...

455
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,632
What was it? That her boyfriend
cheated on her with his ex-wife.

456
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,436
Can I have another cigarette?
I'm...

457
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,353
... aII out.

458
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,829
But if she doesn't drink aIcohoI,

459
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,838
ORDER THURSDAY
then I'm a monkey's uncIe.

460
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,271
Youth WeIfare Department.
Youth SociaI Workers.

461
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,711
I'm sure you can imagine

462
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,831
why we need to taIk today.

463
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,992
This is about you.

464
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,436
Why were you asked to come here today?

465
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,110
Because I did something stupid?
- What stupid thing did you do?

466
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,517
I went into the ceIIar.
- In which one?

467
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,551
What?
- Into which ceIIar?

468
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,558
In your house, the neighbor's house?
- In our house.

469
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,716
How many ceIIars were there?

470
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,838
I was in one.

471
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,670
What about the others
that were there?

472
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,916
I was in another ceIIar too,
but I didn't take anything from it.

473
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,237
What did you take out of the ceIIar?
- Two aquariums.

474
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,319
What did you want with them?
Do you Iike animaIs?

475
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,912
WeII, at first.
But I'm not interested in them anymore.

476
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,316
I gave them to my sister.

477
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,956
Did you get the aquariums for her?

478
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,311
No, but I gave them to her anyway,

479
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,556
because I didn't want them anymore.

480
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,273
Do you have other pets at home?

481
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,517
My sister and I have two.
- What kind of pets?

482
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,996
A bird and a guinea pig.
- Who takes care of them?

483
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,794
My sister.
- Why don't you take care of them?

484
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,630
WeII, sometimes I feed them,
but cIeaning up after them...

485
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,993
What are you interested in?

486
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,639
I start a Iot of things,
and then I give up on them.

487
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,989
You assess yourseIf very criticaIIy.

488
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,839
We've taIked about that a Iot.

489
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,794
What kinds of things have you started?
- Swimming, crafts.

490
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,349
What eIse?

491
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,232
YOU ASSESS YOURSELF CRITICALLY.

492
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,634
Moved to 7th grade.

493
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,550
Behavior: B, effort: C, tidiness...
Why did you give yourseIf a D in tidiness?

494
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,629
WeII, I'm sIoppy.
I mean, I forget most things.

495
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,035
Is art your favorite subject?

496
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,028
That's why you chose the art work group?
- Yes.

497
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,436
And what did we say
we're going to do in September?

498
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,839
Improve.
My mother and I want to sit down together.

499
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,992
What wouId you Iike to improve?
Your behavior or grades?

500
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,320
WeII get rid of aII the Ds
and the Cs too if it's possibIe.

501
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,640
If we get rid of the Ds
then we'II be pretty weII off.

502
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,755
Yeah, but I might have some Cs
in my other subjects,

503
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,236
where I used to have Bs
and then I'd have the same average.

504
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,350
You know, when we taIk
you seen pretty responsibIe to me.

505
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,278
I'm sure you and your mother

506
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,472
had a IittIe taIk before
about aII these probIems.

507
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,631
Do you often do the types of things
that the PeopIe's PoIice Force toId us about?

508
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,160
Yes, once. I mean, severaI times.

509
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,270
And what did you do?

510
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,390
I stoIe money.
- From home?

511
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,433
And other pIaces.
- From who? Friends?

512
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,519
My mother's best friend
and a schooI friend.

513
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,314
Why did that happen?

514
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,756
How much is your aIIowance?

515
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,155
I don't have one.
But I do get something.

516
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,794
I ask Mommy
if I want to go somewhere

517
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,753
Iike to the rec. center,
and she gives it to me.

518
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,552
What about coIIecting scrap?

519
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,070
Lots of kids earn their aIIowance
by coIIecting scrap,

520
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,239
in a compIeteIy honest way.
- That's too easy for the young man.

521
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,068
If you were in the 9th or 10th grade
then I'd understand that.

522
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,397
Those boys are too vain
to be seen with bags of bottIes

523
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,878
and newspapers.
But the 7th grade is actuaIIy an age

524
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,390
where kids reaIIy Iike coIIecting scrap.

525
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,311
What's your routine Iike
after you get home from schooI.

526
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,672
Not a hoIiday Iike today,
but a schooI day. What's your routine?

527
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,270
When I get home...
WeII, for the Iast six months,

528
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,393
I get home, bring down the garbage paiIs,
dry them...

529
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,398
Not aIways, but often.

530
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,354
Then I go downstairs,
instead of doing my homework.

531
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,390
And is your sister as Iazy as you are?
- No.

532
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,876
Is she more responsibIe than you?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

533
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,469
Is she oIder or younger?
- OIder.

534
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,752
How oId is your sister.
- Thirteen. We're twins.

535
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,998
WeII, that shouId spur you on.

536
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,237
As a twin sister...
Are you in the same grade?

537
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,195
How are your sister's grades?

538
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,631
Better. Her average is about a B+,
I think.

539
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,239
So, what do you pIan to change,
besides improving your grades?

540
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,671
Your free time.
How do you want to change your free time?

541
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,632
Can you do it aIone?

542
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,316
I can, if I want to.

543
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,275
So you didn't want to for 13 years,
or for the Iast 6 schooI years,

544
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,436
is that it?

545
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,236
I have IittIe streaks.
Sometimes I want to, sometimes I don't.

546
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,115
SO YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS?

547
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,197
On September 4th,
I want a seIf-assessment.

548
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,631
Even though you don't Iike writing.

549
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,634
IncIude what you
pIan to do in the new year.

550
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,638
And then we'II check your progress reguIarIy.

551
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,029
Got it?

552
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,438
Next week on your own, without Mommy.

553
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,479
Wait outside a moment.

554
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,638
I want to taIk to your mother
for a moment.

555
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,476
You can take that aIong.

556
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,478
ActuaIIy it's Iike this:

557
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,634
we usuaIIy don't get invoIved
with petty crimes.

558
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,437
But you probabIy toId...

559
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,838
the criminaI poIice
that these probIems happen often.

560
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,156
Yes.
- And that's why the comrades asked

561
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,558
that we taIk to you
and see if you need some heIp,

562
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,752
and see how we can heIp you.

563
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,634
I don't Iike that.

564
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,630
I went to our IocaI poIiceman myseIf
and asked for heIp,

565
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,150
and he gossiped
to everybody on the bIock about it.

566
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,349
He's sworn to secrecy too.

567
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,917
I was Iooking for heIp,
but I'm not going back there again.

568
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,475
Of course not.
I'm disappointed in him.

569
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,469
I went there and the peopIe
said things Iike:

570
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,797
''Aw, Iook! The robber famiIy!''
Or... I mean, I'm aIone.

571
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,673
WeII, that couId aIso
have to do with the others.

572
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,998
He's gone downhiII
since he's been

573
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,033
hanging around those two boys.

574
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,949
And...

575
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,950
that takes its toII.
I'm pretty exhausted.

576
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,233
I mean,
I've got a job with a Iot of responsibiIity.

577
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,637
What do you do?
- I'm a managing cIerk at Möve.

578
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,559
Yeah, so...

579
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,468
And I made a huge mistake.
My daughter...

580
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,353
I didn't Iike boys.
I aIways put my daughter first.

581
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,998
I can't make that right in one year's time.
You know?

582
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,033
I didn't Iike boys.
And...

583
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,869
I aIways Iooked for fauIts,
onIy saw fauIts in him.

584
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,275
But not with my daughter.
And he's...

585
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,313
I'd say that my son
is outrageousIy sensitive.

586
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,034
My daughter bears a grudge,
but he doesn't.

587
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,038
That's a big difference.

588
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,312
If you've come to reaIize
that you're aIso to bIame...

589
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,072
I'm trying to set it right,
but I can't do that over night.

590
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,875
... then we can fix it a IittIe at a time.
- I think...

591
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,435
I'm to bIame for a Iot of it, yes.

592
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,996
I even admit that.
- At this point Iet's say

593
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,079
that your son wiII report in reguIarIy.

594
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,078
If that doesn't work out,
the other possibiIity

595
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,271
is that he speak with a psychoIogist,

596
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,268
or that a voIunteer care worker
visits him at home.

597
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,153
I'd have no probIem with that.
Maybe it's better.

598
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,750
He probabIy thinks
this is just another warning.

599
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,713
But I don't want him to be...

600
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,716
But you can't be too hard on him.

601
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,708
I probabIy aIready did that.
I was too hard on him.

602
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,832
I'm pretty strict with him.

603
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,268
Try to praise him more,
even for IittIe things.

604
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,679
He's aII thumbs.
- Then find a way to Iook past that!

605
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,953
My God, there are so many men that...
- Yeah, but for craft projects...

606
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,073
He comes and says: ''Show me how to knit.''
It drives me nuts!

607
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,669
He's Iike a girI somehow.
- Yeah...

608
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,237
But you Iike girIs.
- Yeah, but not if he's a boy!

609
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,558
You have to get over that.
Praise him more, even for IittIe things.

610
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,990
Give him aIIowance.

611
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,715
He just buys candy with it
and then it's gone.

612
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,310
The money's gone!
- So the one mark a week is gone.

613
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,230
SOLIDARITY FRIDAY.
He has to get a reguIar aIIowance.

614
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,235
1 10 going once! 1 10 going twice!

615
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,000
1 15, 120...

616
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,875
Please, please!
Everyone participating, raise your hands!

617
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,950
120 going once! 120 going twice!
120 going three times!

618
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,433
Congratulations!

619
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,315
That's sure to be a unique contribution
to the trophy collection.

620
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,235
120 marks for solidarity.
Thank you very much.

621
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,793
Now something completely different.
A vase for the new apartment.

622
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,713
35!

623
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,033
And 21, 25!

624
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,555
35!

625
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,395
42!

626
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,630
42 going once! 42 going twice! 45!

627
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,839
45 going twice!

628
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,835
45 going once! 45 going twice!

629
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,555
47!

630
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,068
40 going twice! 40 going three times!

631
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,840
Thank you! Moving right along!

WEDDING SATURDAY

638
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,918
Dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,

639
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,398
I've aIready introduced myseIf to you,
but I'd Iike to warmIy weIcome you

640
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,833
in behaIf of the
BerIin Mitte District CounciI.

641
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,433
DearIy beIoved,
we have gathered here today

642
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,030
to seaI your friendship
and Iove for one another

643
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,800
in the bond of matrimony.

644
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,231
With this step you take on

645
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,512
new and quite nice tasks:

646
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,235
You promise to trust and heIp each other,

647
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,750
to be there for each other unseIfishIy,

648
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,589
to share both happiness
and sorrow with each other,

649
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,315
to abandon seIfish wishes.
These are quaIities

650
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,069
that create an enduring bond
between man and wife.

651
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,197
In our country marriage and the famiIy
are under speciaI protection.

652
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,155
AII sociaI conditions were created

653
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,514
so that the famiIy you wish to start
with your marriage today

654
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,998
can deveIop into a true Iife partnership.

655
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,950
Dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,

656
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,711
I wouId Iike to say that the happiness
of your marriage wiII onIy endure

657
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,957
if you both contribute to it.

658
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,233
For not onIy are you man and wife
before the Iaw,

659
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,228
more importantIy
you are Iife partners and friends.

660
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,876
Your wedding day, September 1, 1984,

661
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,878
is aIso the InternationaI Day of Peace.

662
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,436
On a day Iike today
it shouId be cIear to you

663
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,634
that your active participation
is necessary to withhoId this peace.

664
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,673
RecentIy I read
a few Iines in the newspaper.

665
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,270
Maybe you
have some thoughts about them too.

666
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,232
It was written:

667
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,389
''The shining dream of great peace
is buried within our desires.

668
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,309
When its quiet voice is heard
we feeI peace,

669
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,637
and it is more than a feeIing, a desire.

670
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,072
Peace is more than everything in the worId.

671
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,230
Our hearts cannot beat without peace.''

672
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,152
So, dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,
before marriage

673
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,557
many exciting days and hours are spent.

674
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,228
Perhaps that was your experience?

675
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,433
Why not use your wedding
as an opportunity

676
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,632
to refIect for a minute?

677
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,834
Why not take a minute
to remember how you met,

678
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,837
or to think back
on the happy hours you've aIready shared?

679
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:52,516
You must know that marriage and famiIy
are more than just friendship and Iove.

680
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,872
And that the Iove between a man and a woman
must be preserved

681
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,230
in a wide variety of Iife situations.

682
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,149
Once I read something
from Theodor Fontane who cIaimed

683
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,638
that Iove can be sustained
by smaII courtesies.

684
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,310
But you know,
in this day and age we know fuII weII

685
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,750
that it takes a Iot more than that.

686
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,910
From my own experience
I couId add

687
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,317
that reIationships do not aIways stay the same.

688
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,080
They change simpIy due to the fact

689
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,840
that we change over the years.

690
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,559
And we often hear
that passion fades over the years.

691
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,320
There is some truth to that.

692
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,479
But at the same time I'd Iike to assert

693
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,353
that cIoseness shouId not.

694
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,109
By that I mean
that we shouId respect our partner,

695
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,472
understand him,
and make sure he feeIs

696
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,391
that his happiness and weII-being
are of great importance to you.

697
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,355
Yes, this wiII create heaIthy homes

698
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,633
which in turn give each partner
strength and enthusiasm.

699
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,758
For this reason one shouId go to try,

700
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,750
spurred on by the fundamentaIs
of sociaIist moraIs and ethics,

701
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,475
not to focus onIy on individuaI needs.

702
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,834
AIways be in baIance
with the tasks and interests of the society.

703
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,268
On this, your wedding day, you wiII be
showered with many words of congratuIations.

704
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:37,112
I hope and wish for you
that you master your Iife together

705
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,233
as open, joyfuI young peopIe.

706
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,433
Yet it is very important
that your personaI dreams come true.

707
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,756
Dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,

708
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,157
I wouId Iike to end our very short meeting

709
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,918
with a poem.

710
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,352
This is a poem
written by HeImut PreissIer.

711
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,673
He wrote:

712
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,998
''I want to Iive with you,
hope that Iuck wins out.

713
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,431
Though we sureIy
wiII have cause for worry,

714
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,553
after a hard day, make the evening good.
Torture me not with questions!

715
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,876
Give not reproach but courage!

716
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,996
Search not, when we argue,
for the bIame!

717
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,910
Find tenderness,
for Iove needs patience.''

718
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,154
Dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,

719
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,399
you have come here today
to say something as weII.

720
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,675
To speak a cIear, distinct ''yes,''
when I ask each of you in turn

721
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,634
if you are wiIIing to enter into
the bond of matrimony with each other.

722
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,310
And when I cIearIy and distinctIy
hear that from you both

723
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,718
then I'd Iike to say that
that is the proof

724
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,436
that you both Iove each other very much.

725
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,953
Dear Ms. Radke, dear Mr. BaIser,
may I now ask you

726
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,230
to stand.

727
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,393
Do you, Gerd BaIser,

728
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,672
take Petra Radke as you wife,

729
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,431
and accept the surname
you both seIected: BaIser?

730
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,437
Yes.
- Thanks.

731
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,512
And now your statement.

732
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,791
Do you, Petra Radke, aIso take
Gerd BaIser as your husband,

733
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,879
and accept the surname
you both seIected: BaIser?

734
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,035
Yes.

735
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,198
I many now caII you Mr. and Mrs. BaIser.

736
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,076
You have both given your word of consent,
and I confirmed that with my signature.

737
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,635
You are hereby,

738
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,799
under the Iaw
of our German Democratic RepubIic,

739
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,116
now a married-coupIe.

740
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,637
If you'd Iike to seaI that with a kiss,
we'd be happy to watch.

741
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,148
So, now we come to an end.

742
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,672
You must be given the proof
of the marriage we just performed,

743
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,792
the BaIser FamiIy Book
with two marriage certificates.

744
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,309
I have added the other documents.

745
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,750
This is the proof.
You carry the fIowers.

746
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,555
I now present you with the book,
many wishes for a happy future

747
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,595
and my experience:
one must work hard for Iove.

748
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,270
I wish that for you.
CongratuIations, Ms. BaIser.

749
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,439
I wish you both a IoveIy day
despite the rain.

750
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,632
