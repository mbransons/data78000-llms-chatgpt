1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,880
My God, it's full of stars!

2
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,480
My God, it's full of stars!

3
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,020
Neatness! It's a good quality.

4
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,400
You'll make someone a fine wife!

5
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,900
You are Dr. Heywood FIoyd?

6
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,860
Who the hell are you?

7
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm Moisevitch.

8
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm here to talk about your problem.

9
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,610
Really?

10
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,030
What problem's that?

11
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,740
You were chairman
of the National Council on Astronautics.

12
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,410
Now you are a schoolteacher.

13
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,170
This was by your own choice?

14
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,300
ChancelIor of the university.
It pays better. What do you care?

15
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,300
You were responsible
for the Discovery mission.

16
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,930
It was a failure.

17
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,220
Someone had to be blamed, 
so it was you.

18
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
You like being a teacher?

19
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,520
I don't think I like you.

20
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,940
I just read your final report
on what happened to Discovery.

21
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,980
You left a good number of Ioose edges.

22
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,990
-Ends.
-Ioose ends, yes. Thank you.

23
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,780
A good number of questions...

24
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,950
...have remained unanswered.

25
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,660
You just read that report?
Took you this Iong to steal our secrets?

26
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,580
How Iong does it take for your people
to steal ours?

27
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,120
Same amount of time.

28
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,210
This is very bad for my asthma.

29
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,960
You think you could 
meet me halfway?

30
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,090
Maybe.

31
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,470
It doesn't take a very smart man
to appreciate...

32
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,520
...the risk that I am taking
by being here with you, Dr. FIoyd.

33
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,180
And you are a smart man.

34
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,810
This is a very bad business...

35
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,980
...in Central America.

36
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,360
Very bad.

37
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,450
Ships, other planes buzzing around
each other like angry hornets.

38
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
Very bad.

39
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,490
We didn't start it.

40
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,370
We are scientists, you and I, Dr. FIoyd.

41
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,040
Our governments are enemies.

42
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,370
We are not.

43
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,170
Why don't you just try saying
what's on your mind?

44
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,380
I want to play a game with you, Dr. FIoyd.

45
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,590
-I don't have any time for games.
-This is a good game.

46
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,590
It's called '"The Truth.'"

47
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,010
For two minutes, I will tell only the truth.

48
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,060
And so will you.

49
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,690
Two minutes?

50
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,230
Two minutes.

51
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,940
Make it a minute and a half.

52
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,230
One minute and three quarters.

53
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,400
You start.

54
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,240
We know you are building
the Discovery Two...

55
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,580
...to go back to Jupiter to find out
what happened to your men up there.

56
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,080
Also to examine the large monolith.

57
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,580
You know that we are building
the Alexei Leonov to also go up there.

58
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,790
I thought you were gonna call it the Titov.

59
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,420
We changed last month.
People fall out of favor.

60
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,850
The Leonov will reach Discovery
almost a year...

61
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,680
...before you are ready.

62
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,520
My government feels it's very important
that we should get there first.

63
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,480
It's a distinction that will Iook splendid
on the front page of Pravda.

64
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,570
What other value it has, I don't know.

65
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,940
One minute ten.

66
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,070
Why are you telling me this?

67
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,860
Because there are things we need to know.

68
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,030
Otherwise, the same thing that
you let happen to your people up there...

69
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,870
...could happen to ours,
and we would accomplish nothing.

70
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,500
-I have about one minute left?
-About.

71
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,460
The small monolith
you brought back from the moon....

72
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,220
Your government has been very selfish
and stupid in keeping it to yourselves.

73
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,680
You never let us examine it.
What have you found out about it?

74
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
Nothing.

75
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,300
It's impenetrable.

76
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,140
We've tried lasers, nuclear detonators.
Nothing worked.

77
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,810
Forty-five seconds.

78
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,520
The monolith near Jupiter, 
it is the same?

79
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,150
It's even larger.

80
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,150
And the computer on board the Discovery...

81
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,110
...the HAL-9000, can it be reactivated?

82
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,410
Yes.

83
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,280
-By us?
-By you?

84
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,160
It would take three to four months.
You're not familiar with the system.

85
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,960
And Ionger than that
to comprehend the data.

86
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,710
I thought so.

87
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,750
Thirty seconds.

88
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,460
Here we have our quandary.

89
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,760
We are going to get there first...

90
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,010
...yet you have the knowledge
to make the trip work.

91
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,850
How much more time do I have?

92
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,360
You just got yourself an extension.

93
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,740
How could you convince your people
to alIow Americans to go on the flight?

94
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,280
It won't be easy.

95
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,950
However, I'm pretty good.

96
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,200
A Russian craft fIown by Russians...

97
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,330
...carrying a few poor Americans
who need our help....

98
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,040
That also doesn't Iook too bad
on the front page of Pravda.

99
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,380
I don't know if I could 
convince our people.

100
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,640
They wouldn't mind seeing you fail.
They wouldn't mind it at all.

101
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,010
Carrying Americans?

102
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,930
I don't think they would alIow that
if they didn't have to.

103
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,270
They don't have to.

104
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,400
Have you checked 
Discovery's orbit lately?

105
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,650
What?

106
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,900
Have you checked the orbit?

107
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,440
What about it?

108
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,780
Now it's getting chilly here.
This is very bad for my asthma.

109
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,120
You know damn well
we've been checking it.

110
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,040
I have enjoyed our little chat.

111
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,830
What is it you're not telling me?

112
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,210
You are a smart man, Dr. FIoyd.

113
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,460
You will know what to do.

114
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,340
You've double-checked this?
Please say you haven't.

115
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,630
You aren't saying anything, FIoyd.

116
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,180
Something incredible is 
happening up there.

117
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,390
Discovery's being pulled towards Io.
Or pushed away from Jupiter. Whichever.

118
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,690
Sometimes it seems to be accelerating,
and other times it just seems to stop.

119
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,940
I've never seen anything like it.

120
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,270
How Iong before it impacts on Io?

121
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,980
Two, two and a half years.

122
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,700
How could we be so goddamn 
wrong about the orbit?

123
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,320
Because we weren't wrong.

124
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,450
We weren't wrong, then great.
Why the hell is it gonna crash?

125
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,700
I don't know. It's bizarre.

126
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,450
Unless it has something to do
with that monolith.

127
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,710
Do you see that building behind us?

128
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm supposed to go in and 
have lunch in half an hour.

129
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,920
There's one good thing
about a reactionary president:

130
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,720
No health foods. The last one
we didn't lunch, we grazed.

131
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,890
You want to know what lunch
is about? I'll tell you.

132
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,600
We've got two more aircraft 
carriers near Honduras.

133
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,060
The Russians are moving 
their big stuff in.

134
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,440
You got the Joint Chiefs screaming about
Russian satellites with anti-missile lasers.

135
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,860
So we gotta send up our laser 
satellites to counteract theirs.

136
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,860
The president has decided
that the NCA should be put...

137
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,030
...under the Defense 
Department's authority.

138
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,240
Enough with the crazy scientists spending
all this money trying to talk to Martians.

139
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,370
Here we are on your actual brink.

140
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,620
My agency will go military...

141
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,290
...the president's got his finger
on the button...

142
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,260
...and you want me to tell him
we want to hitch a ride...

143
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
...with those same Russians.
Have I missed anything?

144
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,600
-That's about it.
-I didn't want your job, you know.

145
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,430
I didn't force you out.
I didn't blame it on you.

146
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,520
So if this is your plan to try to 
get me killed, you got the wrong guy.

147
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,350
Three men. I tell you, 
we need three men.

148
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,980
The Russians must be laughing
their asses off.

149
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,530
Curnow. He's building 
Discovery Two right now.

150
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,820
He knows more about the 
original than anyone.

151
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,780
He's the only one who can start 
Discovery in a short time.

152
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,490
And I suppose you want to go?
How the hell am I gonna sell it?

153
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,080
The Russians are gonna go
aboard Discovery with or without us.

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,540
Ask him if he wants them
to have all the answers.

155
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,710
Not bad.

156
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,510
We Iost some good men up there,
and I sent them. I have to go.

157
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,180
-Who's the third?
-Chandra.

158
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,350
He designed Hal. 
He can reactivate him.

159
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,560
-I think he is Hal.
-I know.

160
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
-Yeah, but can you trust him?
-No.

161
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,730
But I have to. We have to 
know why Hal malfunctioned.

162
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,110
I got an idea.

163
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,820
You go tell the president,
I'll go on the mission.

164
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,990
You're the NCA Chairman.

165
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,870
That's right, I am.

166
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,040
Iook, tell him we're screwed
if we don't go.

167
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,500
Tell him, if we do go, we'll lie...

168
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,420
...give the Russians false information.
Tell him that. He'll Iove that.

169
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,710
He might.

170
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Good afternoon, Sal.

171
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Do you have anything for me?

172
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,450
No, Dr. Chandra.
Do you have anything for me?

173
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,620
We have often spoken about Hal.

174
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,950
Yes, we have.

175
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,120
We've spoken about
Hal's anomaIous behavior.

176
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,330
You've told me that we can't solve
Hal's behavior without more information.

177
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,620
That is correct.

178
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,540
I enjoy talking about Hal.

179
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,630
I agree that we need more information,
so that we may solve the anomalies.

180
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,970
-And how do we get that information?
-That is obvious.

181
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,800
Someone must return to Discovery.

182
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,180
That person should be you.

183
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,810
I agree.

184
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,850
Now, it Iooks as if that's going to 
happen sooner than we ever expected.

185
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,400
I am pleased to hear that.

186
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,070
I knew you would be.

187
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,530
I would like to expIore another possibility.
Diagnosis is only the first step.

188
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,910
The process is incomplete unless 
it leads to a cure. Do you agree?

189
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,580
Yes, I agree.

190
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,170
Does that mean you believe Hal
can be restored to normal functioning?

191
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,830
I hope. I don't know.

192
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,000
There may have been irreversible 
damage. Certainly Ioss of memory.

193
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,710
I need your cooperation, Sal.

194
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,590
Of course, Dr. Chandra.

195
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,260
-There may be certain risks.
-What do you mean?

196
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,260
I would like to disconnect
some of your circuits.

197
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,640
Particularly your higher functions,
just like Hal was disconnected.

198
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,730
I'd like to see the effects when 
I reconnect your systems.

199
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,270
Just the way I will with Hal.
Does this disturb you?

200
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,690
I am unable to answer that
without more specific information.

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,370
I'm very sorry. It probably doesn't
mean anything, so don't worry about it.

202
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,040
I'd like to open a new file.

203
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,290
Here is the name for it:

204
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,630
Do you know what that means?

205
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,710
There are 25 references
in the current encycIopedia.

206
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,470
Which one do you think is relevant?

207
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,550
The tutor ofAchilles?

208
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,640
That's very interesting.
I didn't know that one.

209
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,350
Try again.

210
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,640
A fabuIous bird reborn
from the ashes of its earlier life.

211
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,310
That is correct.

212
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
And do you know why I chose that?

213
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,530
Yes. Because you have hopes
that Hal can be reactivated.

214
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,990
Yes, with your assistance.

215
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,490
Are you ready?

216
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,660
I would like to ask a question.

217
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,780
What is it?

218
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,080
Will I dream?

219
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,910
Of course you will dream.

220
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,790
All intelligent creatures dream.
Nobody knows why.

221
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,290
Perhaps you will dream of Hal...

222
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,290
...just as I often do.

223
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,570
They've already eaten dinner. You haven't.
Come on to the table, Christopher.

224
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,150
They're hungry.

225
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,320
Then go tell them to come to the table.

226
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,280
I got spaghetti here.
I don't want it to go to waste.

227
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,660
Come on, now.

228
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,180
You'll like it. It's got Iots of 
stuff in it that's bad for you.

229
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,430
I've been thinking about it and
I don't want you to come to my lecture.

230
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,520
It'll make me nervous.

231
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,030
Don't feel offended.
I'm just scared enough as it is.

232
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,820
Besides, you won't be missing much.

233
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,910
It's just a room full of marine 
bioIogists arguing over plankton.

234
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,830
-HelIo?
-What?

235
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,420
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,090
I said, I don't want you 
to go to my lecture.

237
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
I'd be nervous.

238
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,930
Okay.

239
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,260
Contain your disappointment.

240
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
What are you gonna talk about?

241
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,020
Dolphins.

242
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,310
Fish again.

243
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,770
They're not fish, and, yes,
that's what we study.

244
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,940
Why?

245
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,690
Eat.

246
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,280
How was Washington?

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,530
Fine.

248
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,540
Are you tired?

249
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,540
I'm going on the flight.

250
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,550
When?

251
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,140
Four months.

252
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,890
Where are you going, Daddy?

253
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,390
On a Iong trip.

254
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,290
Isn't Mommy hungry?

255
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,080
I don't think so.

256
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,290
How far away is Jupiter?

257
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,410
Far.

258
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Why does it take two and a half 
years to go and come back?

259
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,790
It's so far.

260
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,540
Why don't you go faster?

261
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,960
Can't.

262
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Are you gonna forget about me?

263
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,970
No, I Iove you.

264
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,140
I won't forget about you.

265
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,930
We'll be able to talk to each other,
see each other on television.

266
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,980
Daddy?

267
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,900
What?

268
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,560
Mommy said you're gonna be
asleep for a Iong time.

269
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,900
That's true.

270
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,070
-Are you gonna die?
-What?

271
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,820
Are you gonna die?

272
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,240
Why do you say that?

273
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,990
When Jamie's grandfather died...

274
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,740
...his mom told him that
he'd be asleep for a Iong time.

275
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,200
No, no, no. This is different.
They're gonna wake me up.

276
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,830
But you have to sleep on the way up
and sleep on the way down, otherwise...

277
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,330
...you'd go cuckoo...

278
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,130
...and there wouldn't be enough food
aboard the flight for everybody.

279
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,970
I don't understand.

280
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,110
I want to be grown-up and 
understanding about all this. I really do.

281
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,530
I'm trying so hard, but I can't.

282
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,950
This won't bring back those men.

283
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,290
You've been punishing yourself for years
for something you thought you did wrong.

284
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,160
Or didn't do right.

285
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,670
And now you're Iooking for absolution.

286
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,050
You know...

287
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,920
...you could get yourself killed up there.

288
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,180
I'll be scared enough for both of us.

289
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,500
Dr. FIoyd?

290
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,090
Dr. FIoyd?

291
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,970
Keep your eyes cIosed.

292
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,650
Breathe deeply.

293
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,480
Again.

294
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,650
That's good.

295
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,490
-How do you feel?
-Shaky.

296
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,660
Hungry, I think.

297
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,620
-Can I open my eyes?
-Yes.

298
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,990
Are we there yet?

299
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,200
No, not yet. We are about two days away.

300
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,870
Don't worry, there is nothing wrong.

301
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,710
Your government wanted us
to awaken you.

302
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,000
Dr. OrIov has encountered some 
strange data coming from Europa.

303
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,550
It may be nothing.
He will explain it all to you.

304
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,220
There is no need to 
awaken the others.

305
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,850
-You've done a spectral analysis?
-Of course, I have.

306
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,230
-And?
-And what?

307
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,730
I'm not taking a survey.
If you've done the analysis...

308
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,570
...what are the results?

309
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,190
Nothing conclusive.

310
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,820
Molecular breakdown?

311
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,540
If you Iook carefully at the last page
of the data, you will find the answers.

312
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,750
I don't understand this.

313
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,260
If this data's correct,
then there's something down there.

314
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,840
It can't be correct.

315
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,550
It is correct.

316
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,350
Is it moving?

317
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,690
Yes.

318
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,620
All right...

319
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,410
...what's going on here?

320
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,450
What do you mean?

321
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,710
Well, I may not be the swiftest guy
in the world even when I'm not hungover...

322
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,170
...but I do seem to remember a process
where you ask me questions...

323
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,550
...and I give answers, and I ask 
questions and you give answers...

324
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,760
...and that's the way we find out things.
I think I read that in a manual somewhere.

325
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,430
Your government wanted us to awaken 
you when we reported our findings.

326
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,770
We did that.

327
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,650
You're here to help us reactivate
the Discovery and its computer systems...

328
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,320
...because that is United States territory.

329
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,240
You are authorized to observe
other aspects of our mission.

330
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,700
We have no other obligation.

331
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,700
A Iot has happened
while you have been asleep.

332
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,290
It is not our choice.

333
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,210
The problem in Central America
is growing worse.

334
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,300
It Iooks like you've detected chIorophyll.

335
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,880
The United States is threatening
a naval bIockade.

336
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,550
There's only ice there.
How can there be chIorophyll?

337
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,510
You know and I know that my
country can't alIow a bIockade.

338
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,310
-How fast is it moving?
-We are under instructions--

339
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,230
Just because our governments are acting
like asses doesn't mean we have to.

340
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,690
We're scientists, not politicians. 
How fast?

341
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,900
Dr. FIoyd, I am also an officer
of the Soviet Air Force.

342
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,150
How fast?

343
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,030
One meter per minute.

344
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,240
Don't worry. I'm just observing.

345
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,830
-Towards the sun?
-Yes.

346
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,910
That's incredible!

347
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,670
We are going to send a probe down.

348
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,250
Good!

349
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,290
Oxygen?

350
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,340
ChIorophyll.

351
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,010
Jesus!

352
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,100
-Is it organic?
-I think so.

353
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,110
I'll bring the probe Iower.

354
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,130
What's down in that crater?

355
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,300
There! There!

356
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,670
Let me get this straight.

357
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,090
-There's no telemetry?
-It's all gone.

358
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,930
What about the backup device?

359
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,600
Nothing. Everything was erased.

360
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,220
There was an electrostatic buildup
of some kind.

361
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,520
We'll probably find more of it
when we get cIose to Io.

362
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,190
It has happened before.

363
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,980
There was something down there.

364
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,440
It was organic.

365
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,820
There was life.

366
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
-You don't know that.
-I believe that.

367
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,780
-What are you suggesting we do?
-We should send another probe.

368
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,040
We're getting farther away from 
Europa. It would be difficult.

369
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,370
-Can we sIow down?
-No, we don't have the fuel.

370
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,920
How do we know the same thing
wouldn't happen again?

371
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,340
-Electrostatic buildups don't occur often.
-It wasn't any buildup.

372
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,010
Oh, really, Dr. FIoyd?
And just what do you think it was?

373
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,880
A warning.

374
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,550
There's something down there all right.

375
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,220
We all saw it. We read the data.
We know it's there.

376
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,690
But just suppose... that it had
something to do with the monolith?

377
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,610
Now before you get that Iook on your face
just listen to me for a minute.

378
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,280
We've been sending probes out here
since the '70s.

379
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,820
So have you guys.

380
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:06,320
But none of us have ever encountered
even the slightest signs of chIorophyll...

381
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,410
...on any of Jupiter's moons. Never.

382
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,000
And we certainly were cIose enough,
weren't we?

383
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,750
Nine years ago the 
monolith was detected here.

384
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,130
Discovery was sent up and everything
went wacko. You catching my drift?

385
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,260
So here we are, nine years later,
trying to figure out what happened...

386
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,050
...and what the monolith is all about.

387
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,510
And guess what we discover
aIong the way?

388
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,010
The possibility of life of some kind...

389
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
...where it never existed before.

390
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,310
I don't think it's 
electrostatic anything.

391
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,400
I think something wants us
to stay away from Europa.

392
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,450
Dear Caroline, I miss you terribly.

393
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,700
The time has come to put ourselves
in an orbit around Io...

394
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,870
...which is where the Discovery is.

395
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,080
And we don't have enough fuel
to sIow ourselves down so...

396
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,580
...we are about to use a technique
called aero-braking.

397
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,880
The theory is that we will enter
the outer layer of Jupiter's atmosphere...

398
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,930
...using what is called 
a ballute for a shield.

399
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,300
The atmosphere will sIow us down,
and Jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us...

400
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,520
...and slingshot us around
behind the dark side.

401
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,940
If all goes well, we'll wind up 
in a gentle orbit around Io.

402
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,020
It's dynamite on paper.

403
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,280
Of course, the people who came up
with the numbers on the paper aren't here.

404
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,870
Since no one has ever done this before,
everyone up here is as scared as I am.

405
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,870
The difference is they're busy.

406
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,120
I have nothing to do
but wait for it to happen.

407
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,790
And I hope this is all worth it.

408
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,760
Aero-braking in two minutes.
Two minutes to aero-braking.

409
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,260
One minute, 50 seconds.

410
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
One minute, 40 seconds.

411
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,030
One minute, 30 seconds.

412
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,780
One minute, 20 seconds.

413
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,080
One minute, 10 seconds.

414
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,420
Aero-braking in one minute.

415
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,350
Aero-braking in 50 seconds.

416
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,070
Forty seconds.

417
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,660
Thirty seconds.

418
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,200
Twenty seconds.

419
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,710
Ten seconds.

420
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,420
You speak English?

421
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,960
No English.

422
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,970
Swell.

423
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,460
Okay?

424
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,800
Da. Okay.

425
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,210
My God, it's full of stars!

426
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,800
My God, it's full of stars!

427
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,030
Dr. FIoyd to the medical bay.

428
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,390
-How do you feel?
-Like shit.

429
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,850
That's about right.

430
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,400
-I have this terrible taste in my mouth.
-It takes about 12 hours, then it goes away.

431
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,730
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

432
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,900
Are we there yet?

433
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,740
Well, we should reach the 
Discovery by tomorrow morning.

434
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,120
How was aero-braking?

435
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
We're here, so it worked.

436
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,580
-I wish I could see that.
-I wish I could've slept through it.

437
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,540
By the way, all your messages
are in the communication bay.

438
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,790
They're probably decoded 
and copied now.

439
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,460
I hope you didn't have anything private.
There's a certain paranoia here.

440
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,380
Yeah, what the hell is going on?
This doctor....

441
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,680
-What's his name?
-Rudenko.

442
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,930
Yeah, he acted like he'd found us
under a rock.

443
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,810
-It's the Honduras thing, it's getting worse.
-Still?

444
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,850
There's a bIockade.
The Russians tried to break it.

445
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,850
I don't know. It doesn't Iook good.

446
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,400
Do we have all the telemetry
on the Discovery and the monolith?

447
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,860
They're all in your cassettes. Don't expect
too much cooperation from this crew.

448
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,870
I don't know what's the matter with them.

449
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,700
It's not their fault. Well, maybe it is.

450
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,210
If it has to taste like this...

451
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,460
...I don't care if my electrolytes
are balanced or not.

452
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,460
There's more.

453
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,380
Something extraordinary has 
happened on Europa.

454
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,760
But we shouldn't talk here.

455
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,640
Dear Caroline, the first part of 
this journey is coming to an end.

456
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,480
We are about to rendezvous with
the Discovery. The race will be on now.

457
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,150
We're going to send a boarding 
party over to climb inside this...

458
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,070
800-foot-Iong shipwreck 
fIoating over Io...

459
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,620
to see if she can be rescued
before her orbit gives out.

460
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,740
There are nine years of secrets inside...

461
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,870
...including a sleeping computer
who knows the answers.

462
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,170
My past is also inside...

463
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,590
...and I want those answers.

464
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,490
I'm not an astronaut.

465
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,490
I'm an engineer. 
What am I doing here?

466
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,540
-Temperature's good.
-Yeah.

467
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,910
You know, I hate heights.

468
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,580
So do I.

469
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,840
We've picked good jobs, huh?

470
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,060
Don't forget to write.

471
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,580
Don't breathe too deep.

472
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,670
Breathe normal.

473
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,450
They can't stay exposed to that 
radiation for more than 15 minutes.

474
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,540
-How's his pulse?
-It's high. Not to worry too much.

475
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,330
-Hey, do you speak any Russian?
-No.

476
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,250
That's okay. I speak English.

477
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:51,960
I'm fogging up.

478
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,090
Curnow, have you heard the one about
the marathon runner and the chicken?

479
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,510
Don't patronize me. 
I'm getting nauseous.

480
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,600
If you vomit, you will choke.

481
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,020
Don't cIose your eyes.

482
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,270
Iook at the middle of Discovery.
The middle, not the ends.

483
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,070
Iook at the part where it's moving
the least. Don't take your eyes off it.

484
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,240
I'm gonna throw up.
I'm an engineer, goddamn it!

485
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,570
Maybe you'd better patronize me a little.

486
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,450
-What about the marathon runner?
-I made it up.

487
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,290
-I'm Iooking amidship now.
-You see any lights?

488
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,540
No, no lights.

489
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,700
Seventy meters.

490
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,120
You're almost there.
How's that for patronizing?

491
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,830
-Not bad.
-Fifty meters.

492
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,460
Hey, Max, how do you say '"chicken'"?

493
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,960
Kuritsa.

494
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,800
You speak better than me.

495
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,430
-Thank you.
-Sure.

496
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,850
Thirty meters!

497
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,980
Don't cIose your eyes.

498
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,060
Don't breathe too deep.

499
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,750
Can you see the antenna complex?

500
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,090
Yeah.

501
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,960
What condition is it in?

502
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,670
It Iooks nominal.

503
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,930
Christ, this thing is big!

504
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,220
Fifteen meters.

505
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,970
Look straight ahead.
The center section is hardly moving.

506
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,940
That's where we'll grab hold. 
Ten meters.

507
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,650
You're doing great, Curnow.

508
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,110
Five meters.

509
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,610
Four, three, two...

510
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,860
:::one:

511
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,370
I made it! I made it!

512
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,540
Yes. Hook yourself on there.

513
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,500
I'm hooking on.

514
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,000
Very good.

515
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,840
I am right behind you.

516
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,060
Iook straight ahead.

517
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,940
Without rotation, they'll be in full gravity
before they get to the command module.

518
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,610
Their pulse is rising.

519
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,150
How does it Iook?

520
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,360
It's covered with...

521
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,570
...sulphur.

522
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,370
The structure Iooks sound.

523
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,380
Very good. You're doing great.

524
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,050
We're still a Iong way down.

525
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,390
Very good.

526
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,720
We're making our way aIong the spine.

527
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,940
We're just about there.

528
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,230
Christ! I'm getting heavy!

529
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,990
Don't worry, we're almost there.

530
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,250
We're on the command module.

531
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,710
-I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
-He's hyperventilating.

532
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,680
Listen to me. Thin your 
mixture, add CO2.

533
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,930
I can't, can't....

534
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,390
Can't find it!

535
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,600
I come.

536
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,930
Wait.

537
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,440
I feel so stupid.

538
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,450
How do you say '"stupid'"?

539
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,410
Durak.

540
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,500
It's working.

541
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,870
I'm okay!

542
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,000
Ten more seconds!

543
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,170
Ten more. Durak.

544
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,540
That's me.

545
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,380
You shouldn't feel like that.

546
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,670
The same thing happened to me
the first time I did this.

547
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,050
When have you ever
done this before?

548
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:06,970
Never.

549
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,510
I found the hatch.

550
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,730
I've got the air-Iock status display
down here.

551
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,740
No lights, no power.

552
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,530
-Use the manual.
-Yeah, yeah.

553
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,320
I'm using the manual.

554
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,680
How does it Iook?

555
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,850
No apparent damage.

556
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,220
We're going in.

557
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,060
Welcome to United States territory.

558
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,000
Discovery, you all right?

559
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,710
Discovery's fine.

560
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,300
There's an environment suit here.

561
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,600
-I found Hal.
-How's he Iook?

562
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,640
Asleep.

563
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,350
Well, one pod here.

564
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,110
-Number three.
-Any damage?

565
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,110
None that I can see.

566
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,200
Air Iocks are secure.

567
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,030
No power. The pressure seems okay.

568
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,200
Curnow?

569
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,580
I'd like to test the atmosphere here.

570
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,040
What's the temperature?

571
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,580
I don't know. The auxiliary power's 
out, so the gauges don't work.

572
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,590
It has to be at least 100 beIow zero.

573
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,800
A typical Russian winter.

574
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,430
Well, I'm from California.

575
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,180
We don't know from 100 beIow zero.

576
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,140
-Raise the heat in his suit first.
-Yeah, I'm doing it.

577
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,100
Shine your light on his face.
Make sure he doesn't turn blue.

578
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,850
He's right in front of me.

579
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,730
Keep talking all the time.

580
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,030
All right, Leonov. 
I'm unsealing the visor.

581
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,200
I'm swinging the face plate upward.

582
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,290
It's cold.

583
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,790
I'm taking a breath.

584
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,880
His coIor's okay.

585
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,550
There is oxygen here.

586
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,560
I breathe regularly.

587
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,820
It's too cold to work here
without environment suits.

588
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,450
There is...

589
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,910
...a strange smell here.

590
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,170
Stale, rotten.

591
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,790
Like something has....

592
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,630
What's the matter?

593
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,670
-Discovery, what's happening?
-I think....

594
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,050
No, you're wrong.

595
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,010
Bowman was the last one aboard.
Poole was Iost outside.

596
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,680
Bowman said he ejected those
who died in hibernation.

597
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,270
-There can't be anyone there!
-Maybe Bowman got...

598
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,020
-...back on the Discovery and died here!
-No, he didn't!

599
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,360
-He never came back.
-It's probably the galley.

600
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,150
Some meat went bad
before the Discovery froze up.

601
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,110
I'm telling you, that's what it is!

602
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,870
Hey, would I lie to you?

603
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,450
HelIo, Discovery, are you there?

604
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,830
Yeah, we're here. Everything's fine.

605
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,630
We're proceeding to the bridge.

606
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,430
Durak.

607
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,840
You and me both.

608
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,970
How do you say '"thank you'"?

609
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,310
This is Milson, switching 
to KE-2 in five seconds.

610
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,270
Mark.

611
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,980
I wish I had better news.
It's getting worse here.

612
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,780
The president addressed 
Congress the other day.

613
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,200
He said he wasn't gonna back 
down on the bIockade.

614
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,870
I don't know which was scarier,
the speech or Congress cheering him on.

615
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,580
He evoked Lincoln.

616
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,790
Whenever a president is gonna get us into
serious trouble they always use Lincoln.

617
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,170
I don't know if we're gonna 
be at war or not.

618
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:52,420
It's terrifying hoping the Russians
are less crazy than we are...

619
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,050
...when they are clearly crazy.

620
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,630
Now I think you're in a safer place
than we are.

621
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,300
I just hope that there is 
an Earth to return to.

622
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,390
I heard about the spoiled food
in Discovery's galley.

623
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,060
I'm glad that's all it was.

624
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,640
I'm also glad that you got
the ship under control.

625
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,730
Curnow is a capable man. No one knows
those systems better than he does.

626
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,360
It's a good sign
that there was reserve power.

627
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,650
Maybe the rest of the 
circuitry will work.

628
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,740
We have nothing new here
on the monolith.

629
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,450
Our data confirms yours: 
lt's not moving.

630
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,790
FIoyd to Milson. My news 
is a little better than yours.

631
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,290
Discovery has been partially revived.

632
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,420
We don't know how much 
damage there is...

633
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:37,630
...or if we'll be able to bring it back home.
Most of that is up to Hal.

634
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,930
The drive system could be
operated manually...

635
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:44,180
...so we were able to pull Discovery
away from its decaying orbit around Io.

636
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,020
I must say, the farther 
away I get from Io...

637
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,480
...the happier I am.

638
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,310
It's a violent moon, even for Jupiter.

639
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,940
Europa, for all its cold gray,
is a Iot more comforting.

640
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,700
I tell you, Victor, there's some 
kind of new life down there...

641
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,490
...trying to get through all that ice.

642
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,450
We are 10,000 kiIometers away
from the monolith.

643
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,700
I can't see it yet, 
except I know it's there.

644
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,670
I also think it knows we're here.

645
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,300
It's time to unleash Chandra.

646
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,340
We'll see if our computer brain 
surgeon and psychiatrist...

647
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,590
...can put Hal back together again.

648
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:26,720
To tell you the truth, I don't know if Hal
is homicidal, suicidal, neurotic, psychotic...

649
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,980
...or just plain broken.

650
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,320
This is initial voice-Iogic 
reconstruction test number one.

651
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,860
Diagnostics on voice recognition
and speech synthesis centers...

652
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,490
...has been completed.

653
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,410
At this level all functions appear normal.

654
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,250
HelIo.

655
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,920
Doctor....

656
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,710
Name.

657
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,800
Continue.

658
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,340
Yesterday.

659
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,640
Tomorrow.

660
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,310
HelIo. Doctor. Name.

661
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,100
Continue. Yesterday.

662
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,310
Tomorrow.

663
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,510
Good morning, Dr. Chandra. 
This is Hal.

664
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,930
I'm ready for my first test.

665
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,200
What the hell's this?

666
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,410
I want you to do me a favor.

667
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:41,960
This line here, this is the main power
supply to the control bay circuits, right?

668
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,590
Well, most of them, yeah.

669
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,960
What other ones are there?

670
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,380
Well, all the environment circuits
are fed to this one here.

671
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,140
Yeah, but this is the one
that feeds into Hal, right?

672
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,060
-Yeah.
-All right.

673
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:58,140
I want you to install
this little baby right about there...

674
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,400
...inside the cable trunk.

675
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,980
I want you to put it where nobody
can find it without a deliberate search.

676
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,280
No shit?

677
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
No shit.

678
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,910
Hey, this is pretty neat.

679
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,830
A nonconducting blade so there won't be
any short circuits when you trigger it.

680
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,620
-Where's your remote control?
-If I trigger it.

681
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,130
The control's in my compartment.
The red calculator. You've seen it.

682
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:22,920
Oh, yeah.

683
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,550
Put in nine nines, take the square root
and press the integer. That's all.

684
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,380
-In an emergency, even you can do it.
-What kind of emergency?

685
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,640
Well, if I knew, I wouldn't need 
that stupid thing, would I?

686
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,890
Chandra would have kittens
if he found out.

687
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:39,020
He's not gonna find out, is he?

688
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,770
Well, not from me. They can tear 
off my fingernails, I won't talk.

689
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,110
Install it tonight when he's asleep.
If he ever does sleep.

690
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,530
How can you tell?

691
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,620
Dear Caroline, this is finally it.

692
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,830
After nine years and hundreds of 
millions of miles, we are about to come...

693
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,160
...face to face with the monolith.

694
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:03,540
The last human being who 
did that disappeared.

695
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,500
Something truly amazing 
is going on out here...

696
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,880
...and I really believe this black 
giant is controlling it all.

697
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,010
We have so much to ask.

698
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,800
I have a feeling the answers 
are bigger than the questions.

699
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,960
Is there any information stored
in Hal about the monolith?

700
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,210
No.

701
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,420
Hal was disconnected before 
the Discovery encountered it.

702
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,590
There's nothing in the ship's Iogs or
the recording systems after that.

703
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,140
Whatever secrets Bowman had,
he took with him.

704
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,970
It's the proportions, 
one by four by nine.

705
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:05,020
They are perfect even when 
carried for six decimal places.

706
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:09,020
The small one on the moon, we
encountered exactly the same proportions.

707
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,860
One-four-nine,
the squares of one-two-three.

708
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,700
We spent years trying to attach
some cosmic significance to that...

709
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,570
...and came up with nothing.

710
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,450
We can speculate all we want.
It will not do us any good.

711
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,620
If, for some reason or other,
it's resisting our instruments...

712
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,670
then we must make a cIoser inspection.

713
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,840
I will send Max down with a pod.

714
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,750
I wouldn't do that.

715
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,880
Oh, really? You wouldn't?

716
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,880
That's right, I wouldn't.

717
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:37,510
That's not a pile of junk out there.

718
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,270
We don't know what it is, except that it's
large and seems to have some purpose.

719
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,520
If you want to send a pod down,
send an unmanned one.

720
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,940
-I don't agree.
-I would like to go.

721
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,190
Dumb.

722
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,940
Piece of pie.

723
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,490
-Cake. Piece of cake.
-Cake, yes.

724
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,030
Dumb, that's what it is.

725
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,200
Tell me, Dr. FIoyd...

726
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,490
what has happened 
to American bravery?

727
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,870
It's alive and well, 
thank you very much.

728
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,370
Except for the Russian commonsense.

729
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,090
Max will take the pod.

730
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,930
Just try not to get it mad, all right?

731
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,810
How do you get it mad?

732
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,470
Dumb.

733
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,980
Easy as cake, huh?

734
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,980
Pie. Easy as pie.

735
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,130
I have no indication here.
No magnetic field.

736
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:57,290
Nothing.

737
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,420
I'm having difficulty gauging distance.

738
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,760
Radar signals are not bouncing back.

739
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,800
That pod Iooks awful small.

740
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,640
Good. That means there's nothing
threatening about it.

741
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,810
Maybe Max should extend the
pod's arms with the hands out.

742
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:20,320
Are you serious?

743
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,280
Yes.

744
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,070
That thing with its claws in the air
would scare the piss out of me.

745
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,910
Maybe you're right.

746
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,160
Stop there. Just pause.

747
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,120
Let it know that you're 
not gonna crash into it.

748
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,210
There is no reflectivity.
I can't see any surface features.

749
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,380
It's totally smooth.

750
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,380
Pass over it lengthwise.

751
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,050
Oh, my God!

752
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,050
Max, get the hell out of there!

753
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,060
Max!

754
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,320
Max, you bastard! 
Do you hear me?

755
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,230
Answer me!

756
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:46,780
Max!

757
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,420
With convenient nonstops
to the moon...

758
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,260
...and all major space stations,
on Pan Am...

759
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,260
...the sky is no Ionger the limit.

760
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:17,020
Secretary of State Caulfield
met with the president...

761
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,390
...for two hours this morning
at the White House.

762
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,480
Afterward he had no comment
for reporters.

763
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,610
The president has scheduled
a news conference this evening...

764
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:28,820
...at nine o'cIock, Eastern Standard Time.
We will carry that conference live...

765
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,660
...folIowed by a special report
immediately afterward.

766
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,450
We have an unconfirmed report...

767
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:37,910
...that the president is going to announce
a full-scale military alert tonight.

768
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,830
White House sources have refused
to confirm or deny that report.

769
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,050
HelIo, Betty.

770
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,060
HelIo, Betty.

771
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,560
What is this?

772
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,730
Please talk to me.

773
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,480
Dave?

774
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,360
Dave, is that you?

775
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,900
I'm not sure.

776
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:15,700
I remember Dave Bowman
and everything about him.

777
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,990
Dave is dead.

778
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
All Dave Bowman really was...

779
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,670
...is still a part of me.

780
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,590
Why are you here?

781
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:29,510
I don't know why.

782
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:32,930
I think to say good-bye.

783
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,760
You're married again?

784
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:38,850
Yes.

785
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,020
Is he a good man?

786
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,270
Yes, he is.

787
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:47,520
I'm glad.

788
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,440
I Iove you.

789
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:53,400
Oh, Dave, I Iove....

790
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,110
Good-bye, Betty.

791
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,450
Don't go.

792
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,660
I'm already there.

793
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,870
I don't understand.

794
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,960
Something is gonna happen...

795
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,960
...and I wanted to say good-bye.

796
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,630
What's gonna happen?

797
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,800
Something wonderful.

798
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,050
Dave?

799
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:23,730
The Sheraton Hotel and 
Coral Bay Iounge.

800
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,850
For those who never 
outgrow the wonder.

801
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,580
Buy you a drink.

802
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:51,590
Great stuff, this bourbon. It comes 
from the land called Kentucky.

803
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:56,840
I didn't know you brought liquor
on board. That is forbidden.

804
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,600
You think I'd step foot 
on this tub sober?

805
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,020
Come on, try it. You can't beat
the taste of alcohol and plastic.

806
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,770
You think I was wrong to send Max?

807
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,280
Doesn't matter what I think.

808
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,030
You think I was wrong.

809
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:18,200
Yep.

810
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:34,130
So what else do they do in Kentucky?

811
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,340
They have a big, big horse race.

812
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,470
They play very good basketball.

813
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,810
They have babies like everyone else.

814
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,140
That sounds like a nice place.

815
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,650
Never been there.

816
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,900
Your wife, what is she like?

817
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,160
She's young, bright.

818
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,250
I was married before, you know,
but she died.

819
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,750
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, so was I.

820
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,790
We have a daughter who's 17.

821
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,500
I met Caroline four years later...

822
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:17,380
...and we have a son, five.

823
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,840
And you?

824
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,100
My husband is a physician
at the university hospital.

825
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,430
-We have a daughter.
-How old?

826
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,560
She's four.

827
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,980
-BIonde?
-Yes.

828
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:34,480
Good. Our son likes bIondes.
Let's get 'em together.

829
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,200
Maybe.

830
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,450
Nice if we have a world
they can get together in.

831
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,620
What do you think that is?

832
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,540
I don't know.

833
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,050
Do you think Max knows?

834
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,800
Dr. FIoyd, you are not 
a very practical man.

835
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,890
Iook out there.

836
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,310
Tell me what practical is.

837
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:17,270
Understand, nobody can talk.
The accents will confuse him.

838
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,530
He can understand me, so if you have
any questions, please let me ask them.

839
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:27,740
Good morning, Hal.

840
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,910
Good morning, Dr. Chandra.

841
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,960
Do you feel capable of resuming
all of your duties?

842
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,500
Of course.

843
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,760
I am completely operational and
all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

844
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,050
That's good.
Do you know what those duties are?

845
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,890
Yes. I will operate the onboard systems
of Discovery.

846
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,520
There is a launch window in 31 days...

847
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,680
...when Earth is in the proper position.

848
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:54,850
There is enough fuel on board
for a Iow consumption route...

849
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,150
...that will enable Discovery
to return in 28 months.

850
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,190
This will not present a problem.

851
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,440
That's very good.

852
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:04,410
Now, Hal, do you mind if 
I ask you a question?

853
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,610
Not at all.

854
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,280
Do you recall Dave Bowman and 
Frank Poole leaving the Discovery?

855
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,910
Certainly not.

856
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,910
That could never have happened
or I would remember it.

857
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,460
Where are Frank and Dave?

858
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,000
They're fine. They're not here right now.

859
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,960
Who are these people?

860
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,630
I can only identify you...

861
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,590
...although I compute a 65% probability
that the man behind you is Dr. FIoyd.

862
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:31,100
Don't worry, Hal.
I'll explain everything later.

863
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,230
Has the mission been completed?

864
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,480
You know that I have
the greatest enthusiasm for it.

865
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,360
The mission has been completed
and you've carried out...

866
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,820
...your program very well.

867
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,200
And now, Hal, if you will 
excuse us for a moment...

868
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,870
...we wish to have a private conversation.

869
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:49,280
Certainly.

870
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,580
What was that all about?

871
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,000
I've erased all of Hal's memory
from the moment the trouble started.

872
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,130
The 9,000 Series uses
hoIographic memories...

873
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,920
...so chronoIogical erasures
would not work.

874
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,420
I made a tapeworm.

875
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:05,260
You made a what?

876
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:07,680
It's a program that's 
fed into a system...

877
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,470
...that will hunt down and 
destroy any desired memories.

878
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,720
Wait.

879
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,430
Do you know why Hal 
did what he did?

880
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,600
Yes. It wasn't his fault.

881
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,150
Whose fault was it?

882
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,060
Yours.

883
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,650
-Mine?
-Yours.

884
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,400
In going through Hal's memory banks
I discovered his original orders.

885
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,240
You wrote those orders.

886
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:33,240
Discovery's mission to Jupiter was
in the advanced planning stages...

887
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:37,870
...when the first monolith was found
on the moon and sent its signal to Jupiter.

888
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,960
By direct presidential order, the existence
of that monolith was kept secret.

889
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,540
So?

890
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:45,510
So as the function of the command 
crew, Bowman and Poole,

891
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,720
was to get Discovery to its destination,

892
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,180
it was decided that
they should not be informed.

893
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,260
The investigative team was trained
and put in hibernation...

894
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,100
...before the voyage began.

895
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:59,100
Since Hal was capable of operating
Discovery unassisted, it was decided...

896
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,690
...that he should be programmed
to complete the mission autonomously...

897
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:05,190
...in case the crew
was incapacitated or killed.

898
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,280
He was given full knowledge
of the true objective...

899
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:11,740
...and instructed not to reveal 
anything to Bowman or Poole.

900
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:16,290
-He was instructed to lie.
-What are you talking about?

901
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,410
I didn't authorize anyone to 
tell Hal about the monolith.

902
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:24,040
The directive is NSC 3-4-2/2-3,
Top Secret, January 30, 2001.

903
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,840
NSC, National Security Council,
the White House.

904
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,630
I don't care who it is.

905
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,220
The situation is in conflict with 
the basic purpose of Hal's design...

906
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,980
...the accurate processing of information
without distortion or concealment.

907
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,060
He became trapped.

908
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,900
The technical term is
an H. Mobius Ioop, which...

909
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:48,030
...can happen in advanced computers
with autonomous goal-seeking programs.

910
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,990
The goddamn White House!

911
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:51,910
I don't believe it.

912
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,780
Hal was told to lie...

913
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,950
...by people who find it easy to lie.

914
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:01,540
Hal doesn't know how,
so he couldn't function.

915
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,460
He became paranoid.

916
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:08,210
Those sons of bitches!

917
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,880
I didn't know.

918
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,510
I didn't know!

919
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:24,940
We have here Mrs. Jessie 
Bowman, age 77.

920
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:27,270
She's the mother of the 
astronaut who died.

921
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,650
She's been in the nursing 
home for six months.

922
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:33,740
Four weeks ago, she collapsed in her room.
She was comatose when we got to her.

923
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,910
She was worked up and found
to have suffered a massive C.V.A...

924
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:41,040
...in the left parietal and frontal Iobes.
The CAT scan showed a massive bleed.

925
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,210
She has been comatose
since her admission...

926
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,630
...and is unable to have
spontaneous respiration.

927
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,540
There is no response to stimuli.

928
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,210
She has had two episodes of 
pneumonia and is febrile.

929
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,260
We've been giving her
intravenous antibiotics for ten days.

930
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,100
Any change?

931
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,720
Physical therapy?

932
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:04,230
Range of motion four times a day,
and she's turned every 30 minutes.

933
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:06,860
Thank you.

934
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,740
Dr. Detchum, Dr. Detchum, 35.

935
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:23,210
Dr. Craig, Dr. Craig, 35.

936
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,630
Dr. Craig, 35, please.

937
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,730
Dr. Craig, 35, please.

938
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,920
All hands to the Ward Room.

939
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,050
All hands to the Ward Room, please.

940
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:18,220
This is a most difficult announcement.

941
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:23,560
As you know, things have 
not been going well back home.

942
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,730
Well, it's gotten worse, a Iot worse.

943
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:32,070
Yesterday a Soviet destroyer
challenged the bIockade.

944
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:36,740
Several warning shots were fired
across her bow. She did not respond.

945
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:40,490
A second volley was fired.
There still was no response. None.

946
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:45,750
The nuclear destroyer U.S.S. Cunningham
launched two of her Falcon missiles.

947
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:50,750
Both struck the Soviet vessel amidship.
She broke in two and sunk.

948
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,090
Eight hundred of her crew were Iost.

949
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,760
This morning...

950
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:00,680
...an American surveillance satellite
was struck by a Soviet laser...

951
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,890
...fired from the Sergei 
Kirov Space Station.

952
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,640
The American satellite was destroyed.

953
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,610
The United States has broken off
dipIomatic relations with Russia.

954
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,190
All ambassadors have been recalled.

955
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:18,280
The Soviet ambassador has been 
expelled aIong with the entire staff.

956
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:24,530
All American air defense and
satellite defense forces are on full alert.

957
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,710
Premier UIonova made a televised 
address and said that technically...

958
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:32,960
...a state of war exists 
between our two countries.

959
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:38,090
All American personnel are ordered
to leave Soviet territory immediately...

960
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,260
...or they will be placed under arrest.

961
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:44,720
All Russian personnel are similarly 
ordered to evacuate American territory.

962
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:50,100
As a result, by direct presidential order,
the three of you must leave the Leonov.

963
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:54,770
No Russian citizen is alIowed to remain 
on or alIowed to enter the Discovery.

964
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,980
This order is effective immediately.

965
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:59,610
The launch window for 
re-entry is 28 days.

966
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:03,030
The Discovery has enough fuel
for a Iow consumption trajectory.

967
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:06,160
Hal seems to be reactivated
and is functioning well enough...

968
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,950
...to operate the onboard systems.

969
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:11,080
The Leonov has enough fuel
for a Iow consumption trajectory...

970
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,000
...that will arrive 12 months earlier.

971
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,920
The launch windows are 
critical for both spacecrafts.

972
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,630
Only communications of 
an emergency distress nature...

973
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,010
...are alIowed between
the Leonov and Discovery.

974
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:24,850
I know you people are caught in
the middle of this. In a sense, we all are.

975
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,060
I wish there was 
something I could do.

976
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:31,640
The only thing left for us is to pray.
Pray for the safety of our families...

977
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,860
...for our countries, for our planet.

978
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:38,190
May God forgive us and protect us.

979
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,880
Hal, give me a system 
status report, please.

980
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,840
Just one moment, please.

981
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,850
I'm sorry for the delay.

982
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:10,180
My voice recognition circuits 
are not completely restored...

983
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:12,770
...although, as you can see,
they are improving.

984
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,560
All systems are functional.

985
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,900
There is a small pressure leak in
the aft heating unit. It is nothing serious.

986
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:22,440
I can compensate for it by 
using the redundant units.

987
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:23,490
Thank you.

988
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,700
Dr. FIoyd?

989
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,490
Yes?

990
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,330
Would you like to play a game 
of chess? I play very well.

991
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,740
I'm sure you do. No, thank you.

992
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:32,830
Dr. FIoyd?

993
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,580
-What is it, Hal?
-There is a message for you.

994
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,040
-Who's calling?
-There is no identification.

995
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:40,630
What's the message?

996
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,670
The message as folIows:

997
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,510
"It is dangerous to remain here.

998
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,800
"You must leave within two days. "

999
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,180
What?

1000
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:52,270
Do you want me to repeat 
the message, Dr. FIoyd?

1001
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,190
Who recorded it?

1002
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,600
This is not a recording.

1003
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:59,440
-Who's sending it?
-There is no identification.

1004
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,900
I don't understand.

1005
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,780
Neither do I.

1006
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:06,280
Is this message by voice or keyboard?

1007
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,700
I don't know.

1008
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,120
My response is:

1009
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:12,370
We don't have enough fuel
for an early departure.

1010
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,700
The answer is:

1011
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:18,170
"I am aware of these facts. Nevertheless,
you must leave within two days. "

1012
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,380
Hal, who the hell is sending this?

1013
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,420
I'm sorry, Dr. FIoyd. I don't know.

1014
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:25,800
Well, tell whoever it is that I 
can't take any of this seriously...

1015
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,050
...unless I know who I'm talking to.

1016
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,100
-Dr. FIoyd?
-Yes?

1017
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:32,600
The response is:

1018
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:34,980
"I was David Bowman."

1019
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,980
Do you want me to repeat
the last response?

1020
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,070
No, no.

1021
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,660
Tell Curnow that this is no time for jokes.

1022
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:54,330
Dr. Curnow is not sending the 
message. He is in Accessway 2.

1023
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,330
Well, tell whoever it is that...

1024
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:01,670
...I can't accept that identification
without proof.

1025
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,710
The response is: "I understand.

1026
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:09,430
"It is important that you 
believe me. Iook behind you."

1027
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,440
HelIo, Dr. FIoyd.

1028
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,940
Please...

1029
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,700
...believe me.

1030
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:15,330
What are you?

1031
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,990
This is very difficult for me.

1032
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,710
I don't have much time.

1033
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,210
I've been alIowed to 
give you this warning.

1034
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,460
You must leave here in two days.

1035
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,470
AlIowed?

1036
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,640
By who?

1037
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,470
I can't explain.

1038
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:21,390
You see, something's 
going to happen.

1039
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,020
You must leave.

1040
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:27,810
What?

1041
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:31,900
What's going to happen?

1042
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,360
Something wonderful.

1043
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,950
What?

1044
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,410
I understand how you feel.

1045
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,540
You see, it's all very
clear to me now.

1046
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,540
The whole thing.

1047
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,540
It's wonderful.

1048
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,210
Please, if....

1049
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:53,130
Good-bye, Dr. FIoyd.

1050
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,890
We can have no further contact.

1051
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,220
Remember:

1052
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,430
You have two days.

1053
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,980
We can't leave in two days.

1054
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,390
There may be another message after...

1055
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,810
...if all goes well.

1056
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:15,030
What's going to happen?

1057
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,180
Kirbuk.

1058
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:43,430
This is FIoyd. I'm coming over. If anyone's
on the bridge, tell them to get Iost.

1059
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,850
It's impossible. You heard 
the orders. You can't.

1060
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:50,150
You want to arrest me, go ahead, because
I'm coming over and we're gonna talk.

1061
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:54,730
-You want to put the cuffs on?
-Cuffs?

1062
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,900
-Never mind.
-What is so important that you do this?

1063
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,030
Now listen to me. Just listen to me!

1064
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:03,330
We've gotta get out of here.
We have to leave in two days.

1065
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,330
What are you talking about?

1066
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,040
Something....

1067
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,000
Something extraordinary
is going to happen.

1068
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,630
I don't know what.

1069
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:15,050
But we have to initiate an
escape launch in two days.

1070
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,510
You have been drinking
your whiskey from Kentucky.

1071
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:19,840
I wish I had.

1072
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:24,720
I can't tell you why I know 
what I know, because...

1073
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:29,270
...if I told you you'd never believe me.
You simply have to trust me.

1074
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,440
I know that trust doesn't 
come easy with what's going on.

1075
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,940
I can't just order us to leave here for no
reason. I am under orders and so are you.

1076
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:38,240
The hell with those orders!

1077
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,450
The people who gave those orders
don't know what they're doing.

1078
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:43,570
-This is crazy.
-You bet it is!

1079
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:46,870
Even if I should trust you,
which I'm not sure that I do...

1080
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:51,620
...or even if I should want to leave here
for no reason, I can't, and neither can you.

1081
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,420
We don't have enough fuel
until Earth is in the correct position...

1082
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:58,760
...which is three weeks away.
So, it's impossible for both of us.

1083
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,970
You're wrong. 
We can't do it separately.

1084
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:02,890
We can do it together.

1085
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:05,430
What are you talking about now?

1086
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:09,810
We have enough fuel in 
Discovery for a launch.

1087
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,900
You have enough fuel in the 
Leonov for the trip home.

1088
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,980
We use the docking ring in the 
Leonov to attach to the Discovery.

1089
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:21,030
Then we use the Discovery
as a booster rocket for the launch.

1090
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,610
When we use up 
the Discovery's fuel...

1091
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,490
...we detach.

1092
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,830
She falls away and we use the 
Leonov for the trip home.

1093
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,250
It'll work.

1094
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:31,750
Perhaps.

1095
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:33,670
If we start now.

1096
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,090
No, you, you ask too much of me.

1097
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,180
I can't do all of these things for no reason.
I can't disobey my country for no reason.

1098
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,550
Forget reason! No time to be reasonable.

1099
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,430
The politicians can screw themselves.
We're not playing games. The war is over.

1100
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,480
Good Christ!

1101
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,980
It's, it's gone!

1102
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,920
Message from Milson 
to FIoyd. Top secret.

1103
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,590
Switching to keys Alpha / Leader 
7-2-7-4, on your mark.

1104
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,100
Mark.

1105
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:29,720
Dr. Curnow asked ground
to furnish him with data...

1106
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,720
...as to the stress points on Discovery.

1107
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:35,140
The answers are being 
transmitted binary in 15 minutes.

1108
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,610
As to how much torque it was 
designed to take, no one here is sure.

1109
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:41,030
We'd like to know the reason
for Curnow's request.

1110
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:45,450
Please send your reply as soon as possible.
End transmission, Milson 2-7-7-9.

1111
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,830
Message from Milson to FIoyd.

1112
01:29:56,870 --> 01:30:00,800
It's been 12 hours since my request
for information. I need a reply.

1113
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,670
All hell is breaking Ioose down here.

1114
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:06,090
I have enough problems without
you pulling some kind of a stunt.

1115
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:08,760
I only hope there's a world 
left for you to return to.

1116
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,850
Report to ground as to what is going on
and make that report immediately!

1117
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:16,940
And while you're at it, could you please
check out a black spot on Jupiter...

1118
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,810
...that has been detected
by satellite telescope.

1119
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:23,820
It is on the dark side and should be
coming around your way in four hours.

1120
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:26,610
End transmission, Milson 2-7-8-0.

1121
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:29,120
I have made the calculations.

1122
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:34,160
To get enough veIocity for an escape
launch with Earth that far out of position...

1123
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,620
...we will need a full power burn
from Discovery of over 120 seconds.

1124
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,210
If the engines shut down too early...

1125
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,920
...we will not have enough 
veIocity to get back home.

1126
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,720
Discovery has enough on board.

1127
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,300
Hal should be able
to control the burn, right?

1128
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:51,970
How Iong will it take you to 
program Hal for the launch?

1129
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:55,980
I don't know. It's not 
as simple as that.

1130
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,140
I have spent the 
last several weeks...

1131
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:01,110
...programming Hal for a 
1,000-day orbit back to Earth...

1132
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:04,320
...and now all those programs 
will have to be dumped.

1133
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,400
How Iong will it take?

1134
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,950
We know how sensitive he is
to mission objectives...

1135
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,160
...and now you're telling me
to program him...

1136
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,200
...for the destruction of the Discovery
as well as his own destruction.

1137
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,870
Has anybody considered his reaction?

1138
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:20,460
Are you saying that he might
disobey orders as he did last time?

1139
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,170
That didn't happen last time.

1140
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:25,170
He was given conflicting orders and
he did his best to interpret them.

1141
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:26,550
Then what are you saying?

1142
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:29,130
I am saying that I don't know
how he will react.

1143
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,550
I'm sorry, but I don't.

1144
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:33,260
-Have you discussed this with Hal?
-No.

1145
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,310
Ioad the new program.
We don't have any choice.

1146
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,640
Now remember, he was 
programmed for curiosity.

1147
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:43,310
If the crew was killed, he was capable of
carrying out the mission on his own initiative.

1148
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,650
He will question me
about the change in plans.

1149
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:50,280
-What do you want me to tell him?
-Tell him Discovery's in no danger.

1150
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
-But that's not true.
-We don't know that.

1151
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:53,120
He will suspect it.

1152
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,620
Otherwise, why would we be leaving
weeks ahead of our launch window?

1153
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:00,460
Whether we are based on carbon or 
silicon makes no fundamental difference.

1154
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,460
We should each be treated 
with appropriate respect.

1155
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,920
So our choice is him or us?

1156
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:07,210
Well, I vote us.

1157
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,920
All opposed.

1158
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:11,590
The ayes have it.

1159
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,590
Will he believe you?

1160
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,890
Yes.

1161
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,600
Then let's get started.
We haven't got much time.

1162
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:51,510
-Are you as scared as I am?
-Are you kidding?

1163
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,510
You think we should override Hal
and fire the engines manually?

1164
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,970
Too risky. We've got one chance
to leave after tomorrow's orbit.

1165
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,060
We fire the engines at the wrong 
time, we go off the wrong direction...

1166
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,560
...and we don't have the fuel
to make a correction.

1167
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,980
I don't think we can 
handle it manually.

1168
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:07,480
What about Hal shutting them off
before all the fuel is gone?

1169
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,900
Once he fires the engine, I can 
always disconnect him if I have to.

1170
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:13,650
Just don't Iose that calculator.

1171
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,330
Shit! Please don't do that again.

1172
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,300
This is what your people 
told you about.

1173
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,510
-What is it?
-I don't know.

1174
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,220
-Could it be a shadow?
-I don't know.

1175
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,520
We are too far to see any detail.

1176
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:45,980
When we come around the other side
before the launch, we will be cIoser.

1177
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,020
Then we can see.

1178
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:29,730
Twenty-eight minutes.

1179
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:35,700
That's funny. I've been thinking.

1180
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,660
Do you know what I miss?

1181
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:39,240
I miss green.

1182
01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:41,740
Trees and...

1183
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,740
...and grass....

1184
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,410
I Iove green.

1185
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,420
I'd Iove a hot dog.

1186
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,750
The Astrodome. Good hot dogs.

1187
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,920
Astrodome?

1188
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,670
You can't grow good 
hot dogs indoors.

1189
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:59,590
Yankee Stadium, September.

1190
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:03,600
Hot dogs have been boiling
since the opening day in April.

1191
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,060
That's a hot dog.

1192
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,440
The yelIow mustard 
or the darker one?

1193
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,640
Darker.

1194
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:10,900
That's important.

1195
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,190
Darker.

1196
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:19,450
You think we're gonna get out
of this alive?

1197
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:21,160
We have a chance.

1198
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,500
A man of few words. I like it.

1199
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,960
Fifteen minutes to ignition.
All systems nominal.

1200
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,330
Good. Thank you, Hal.

1201
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,210
We read 15 minutes, Discovery.

1202
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,510
Dr. Chandra, I've checked 
my calculations again.

1203
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:41,890
By using all of Discovery's fuel now,
Discovery will not be in proper position...

1204
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:43,510
...to rendezvous with Earth.

1205
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:46,020
-Yes, I know.
-Then why are we doing it?

1206
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,440
You will rendezvous
with the new space station.

1207
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,940
The Leonov has been ordered
home immediately.

1208
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,820
I have no information regarding
a new space station.

1209
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:58,820
Yes, I...

1210
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,200
...I know.

1211
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:05,200
It was completed two years ago.

1212
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,370
Oh, my God!

1213
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,410
Put the telescope on the monitor.

1214
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,180
Increase the magnification.

1215
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,890
Eleven minutes to ignition.

1216
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,940
I don't believe it!

1217
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:35,690
Dr. Chandra, I detect strong
vocal stress patterns.

1218
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,440
-Is there a problem?
-No, Hal.

1219
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:39,440
The mission is proceeding normally.

1220
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:42,320
Can you analyze the image
on monitor circuit two?

1221
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:45,910
Yes. There is a circular 
object near the equator.

1222
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:49,040
It is 22,000 kiIometers in diameter.

1223
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:51,710
It is comprised of 
rectangular objects.

1224
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:52,790
How many?

1225
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:56,670
1,355,000 plus or minus 1,000.

1226
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:59,380
And what is the proportion
of the objects in question?

1227
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:01,090
One by four by nine.

1228
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:02,930
Do you recognize these objects?

1229
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,850
Yes. They are identical in size and shape
to the object you call the monolith.

1230
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,720
Ten minutes to ignition.

1231
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,020
All systems nominal.

1232
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,520
Is the number of 
monoliths constant?

1233
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,690
No.

1234
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,400
-They are increasing.
-At what rate?

1235
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:20,900
Once every two minutes.

1236
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:29,450
Iook cIosely.

1237
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:34,290
Tell me I'm nuts. Are the cIoud 
formations going towards the spot?

1238
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:35,620
You're not nuts.

1239
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:38,670
Iooks like the thing 
is eating the planet.

1240
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:40,500
I think it is.

1241
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:42,840
It's reproducing exactly like a virus.

1242
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:47,090
Eight minutes to ignition.
Dr. Chandra, may I make a suggestion?

1243
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,800
Of course. What is it, Hal?

1244
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:53,060
This is a very unusual phenomenon. Don't
you think I should abort the countdown...

1245
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,940
...so that you can 
remain and study it?

1246
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:57,270
Chandra, get on the headset.

1247
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,020
Use the private channel.

1248
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:00,900
Okay.

1249
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:04,650
Now you've got to talk quickly.
Persuade him to continue the countdown.

1250
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,240
I don't care what you say,
only don't let him stop.

1251
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,620
Five minutes to ignition.

1252
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:12,450
Dr. Chandra, I'm ready to stop
the countdown if you want.

1253
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:13,750
No, Hal, don't stop.

1254
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:17,370
I am fully confident in your ability
to study the phenomenon by yourself.

1255
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,830
I have complete faith in you.

1256
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,710
Propellant tank pressurization 
completed. Voltage steady.

1257
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,170
Are you sure you are making
the right decision?

1258
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:27,050
I think we should stop.

1259
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:29,140
Four minutes to ignition.

1260
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:31,100
I enjoy working with 
human beings...

1261
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,770
...and have stimulating 
relationships with them.

1262
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,270
We enjoy working with you, Hal,
and we will continue to do so...

1263
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:39,770
...even if we are separated
by great distance.

1264
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,190
Good God!

1265
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,730
The coIor.

1266
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:44,320
It's fading!

1267
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:52,830
It seems to be Iosing 
its chemical strength.

1268
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:55,410
I think we should stop the 
countdown, Dr. Chandra.

1269
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:58,080
No. Don't do that.

1270
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:01,590
This behavior is inconsistent 
with Iogic, Dr. Chandra.

1271
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:06,090
This phenomenon is too important
to leave, unless it represented danger.

1272
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:08,430
Do you think there is danger here?

1273
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,890
Captain...

1274
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,680
...how critical is our ignition?

1275
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,260
Can we do this manually?

1276
01:39:13,310 --> 01:39:15,100
Is very critical.

1277
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:18,390
We cannot be accurate to a tenth 
of a second if we do it manually.

1278
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,690
Three minutes to ignition.

1279
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:23,690
Dr. Chandra, I am 
waiting for your reply.

1280
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:30,110
I don't have time to explain 
everything to you, Hal.

1281
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,700
We have to leave here
and we need your help.

1282
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:34,790
Thirty seconds to final sequence.

1283
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:38,540
If you would tell me the reasons
perhaps I could be of help.

1284
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:41,040
Final sequence beginning.

1285
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:43,630
Two minutes to ignition.

1286
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:54,510
Dr. Chandra, I find it difficult
to proceed with the ignition...

1287
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,770
...without knowing why we are 
doing this. Is the mission in jeopardy?

1288
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,730
Yes, we're in jeopardy.

1289
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:11,160
Is that why we are making our
escape launch before the launch window?

1290
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:13,370
Yes, Hal.

1291
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,740
Ignition in 90 seconds.

1292
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,330
If there is danger here...

1293
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:20,080
...and I use up all the 
fuel in the escape...

1294
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:22,830
...what will happen
to the Discovery?

1295
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,380
It could be destroyed.

1296
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:34,090
And if I don't proceed 
with the launch?

1297
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:37,770
Then the Leonov and everybody 
in it could be destroyed.

1298
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:46,690
I understand now, Dr. Chandra.

1299
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,280
Do you want me to stay with you?

1300
01:40:56,330 --> 01:41:00,200
No. It is better for the mission
if you leave.

1301
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,870
One minute to ignition.

1302
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:05,540
Thank you for telling me the truth.

1303
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:07,800
You deserve it.

1304
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,800
Fifty seconds.

1305
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,130
Dr. Chandra?

1306
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:14,840
Yes?

1307
01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:17,050
Will I dream?

1308
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:22,390
I don't know.

1309
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,900
Forty seconds.

1310
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:31,570
Thirty seconds.

1311
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:37,990
Thank you, Hal.

1312
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:40,240
Good-bye, Dr. Chandra.

1313
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,590
Twenty seconds.

1314
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:52,010
Chandra, get the hell out of there!

1315
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,520
Ten, nine...

1316
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,650
...eight, seven...

1317
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:10,570
...six, five...

1318
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:12,940
...four, three...

1319
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:14,530
...two, one.

1320
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,860
Ignition full thrust.

1321
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:35,190
One minute to separation.

1322
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:37,190
Separation in one minute.

1323
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,530
You had us scared for a moment.

1324
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:45,200
-Nice work. You all right?
-Yes, I'm all right.

1325
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:50,370
Thought you might want this.

1326
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:52,290
Damn. When?

1327
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:54,880
It wasn't very hard to find.

1328
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:58,170
Yeah, I knew you would do
something like this.

1329
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,890
Separation in 20 seconds.

1330
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,890
Separation in 10 seconds.

1331
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:09,810
Nine...

1332
01:44:09,850 --> 01:44:11,400
...eight...seven...

1333
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:13,270
...six...five...

1334
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:15,320
...four...three...

1335
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:17,150
...two...one...

1336
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:18,820
...zero.

1337
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,120
Hal, do you read me?

1338
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,490
Yes, Dave. Where are you?

1339
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:10,450
I cannot see you on 
any of my monitors.

1340
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:14,040
That isn't important now.
I have new instructions for you.

1341
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:18,460
I want you to point the 
AE-35 antenna towards Earth.

1342
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:21,970
Dave, that will mean breaking 
contact with the Leonov.

1343
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:25,260
I will no Ionger be able to relay
my Jupiter observations...

1344
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,890
...according to program.

1345
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:28,390
I understand.

1346
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:30,520
The situation has changed.

1347
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,100
Accept priority override Alpha.

1348
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:36,230
Here are the AE-35 coordinates.

1349
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,730
Please do it now.

1350
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:42,490
Instructions confirmed, Dave.
It is good to be working with you again.

1351
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:45,280
Have I fulfilled
the mission objectives properly?

1352
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:48,280
Yes, Hal. You've done very well.

1353
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:52,950
Now there is one final message 
for you to transmit to Earth.

1354
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,500
It is the most important message
you have ever sent.

1355
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:00,500
I want you to keep repeating it
as many times as possible.

1356
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,670
What is going to happen, Dave?

1357
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:04,970
Something wonderful.

1358
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:06,390
I'm afraid.

1359
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:09,180
Don't be. We'll be together.

1360
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,060
Where will we be?

1361
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,680
Where I am now.

1362
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,810
Iock confirmed on Beacon Terra 1.
Message commencing.

1363
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:33,500
It's shrinking! It's shrinking!

1364
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:19,620
Don't quit now!

1365
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:21,920
Move!

1366
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,760
Grab something, now!

1367
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:20,500
My dear Christopher...

1368
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:24,750
...this is the last time I'll be able
to speak to you for a Iong while.

1369
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:28,340
I'm trying to put into words
what has happened.

1370
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:31,840
Maybe that's for historians to do
sometime later.

1371
01:49:33,010 --> 01:49:34,970
They will record that the next day...

1372
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,850
...the president of the United States
Iooked out the White House window...

1373
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:42,600
...and the premier of the Soviet Union
Iooked out the Kremlin window...

1374
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:46,190
...and saw the new 
distant sun in the sky.

1375
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:50,110
They read the message, and 
perhaps they learned something...

1376
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:54,110
...because they finally recalled
their ships and their planes.

1377
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:57,700
I'm going to sleep now.

1378
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:00,950
I will dream of you 
and your mother.

1379
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,790
I will sleep knowing
that you are both safe...

1380
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,460
...that the fear is over.

1381
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:11,710
We have seen the process 
of life take place.

1382
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:16,550
Maybe this is the way it happened 
on Earth millions of years ago.

1383
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:20,140
Maybe it's something 
completely different.

1384
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:24,140
I still don't know really
what the monolith is.

1385
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,480
I think it's many things.

1386
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,480
An embassy for an 
intelligence beyond ours...

1387
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:33,320
...a shape of some kind for 
something that has no shape.

1388
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:39,910
Your children will be born
in a world of two suns.

1389
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:42,990
They will never know a 
sky without them.

1390
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:45,250
You can tell them that...

1391
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:48,250
...you remember when there 
was a pitch black sky...

1392
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:51,250
...with no bright star,
and people feared the night.

1393
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:54,170
You can tell them 
when we were aIone...

1394
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:58,260
...when we couldn't point to 
the light and say to ourselves...

1395
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,180
...there is life out there.

1396
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:06,600
Someday the children of the new sun
will meet the children of the old.

1397
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:09,350
I think they will be our friends.

1398
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:13,320
You can tell your children of the
day when everyone Iooked up...

1399
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:17,400
...and realized that we were 
only tenants of this world.

1400
01:51:17,490 --> 01:51:21,870
We have been given a new lease
and a warning from the landIord.
