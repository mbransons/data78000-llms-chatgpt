1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,753
<i>Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.</i>

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,396
<i>This must be distinctly understood...</i>

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,799
<i>...or nothing wonderful can come
of this story I am going to relate.</i>

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,476
<i>On Christmas night all Christians sing
To hear the news the angels bring</i>

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,997
Thank you, sir.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,231
<i>To hear the news the angels bring</i>

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,991
Holly! Get your Christmas holly!

8
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,590
Seven years ago today.

9
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,114
What's that you say?

10
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,511
Mr. Marley died.
Seven years ago this very day.

11
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,318
Would it be too much to ask...

12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,796
...that you return to the work
for which I pay you so handsomely?

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,389
Mr. Cratchit!

14
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,394
The fire's gone cold, Mr. Scrooge.

15
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,395
Come over here, Mr. Cratchit.

16
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,317
- What is this?
- A shirt.

17
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,071
- And this?
- A waistcoat.

18
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,830
- And this?
- A coat.

19
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,593
These are garments.

20
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,196
Garments were invented
as protection against the cold.

21
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,079
Once purchased,
they may be used indefinitely...

22
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,669
...for the purpose
for which they are intended.

23
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,992
Coal burns.

24
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,314
Coal is momentary, and coal is costly.

25
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,957
There will be no more coal
burnt in this office today.

26
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,674
- Is that quite clear, Mr. Cratchit?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,559
Get back to work
before I'm forced to conclude...

28
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,035
...that your services
are no longer required.

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,799
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,431
- Merry Christmas, Bob Cratchit.
- The same to you, Mr. Fred.

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,597
Merry Christmas, Uncle.

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,989
I said, merry Christmas, Uncle.

33
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,918
Humbug.

34
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,798
Christmas, a humbug, Uncle?

35
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,078
- Surely you don't mean that.
- I do.

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,514
What's Christmas...

37
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,399
...but a time for buying things...

38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,398
...for which you have no need,
no money?

39
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,988
Time for finding yourself
a year older, not an hour richer.

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,912
If I could work my will...

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,391
...every idiot who has
"Merry Christmas" on his lips...

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,068
...should be boiled
in his own pudding...

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,471
...and buried with a stake of hollies
through his heart.

44
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,029
Come now, Uncle.

45
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,558
You keep Christmas in your way,
and let me keep it in mine.

46
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,074
You don't keep it.

47
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,038
Let me leave it alone then!

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,599
Much good it may do you.
Much good it has done you.

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,917
There are many things
in which I might have derived good...

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,396
...from which I have not profited.
Christmas, among the rest.

51
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,829
But I've always thought
of Christmastime as a good time...

52
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,395
...a kindlier, forgiving,
charitable time...

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,200
...when men and women
see their one consent...

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,592
...to open their shut-up hearts
freely to their fellow creatures.

55
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,228
Though it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver into my pocket...

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,392
...I do believe
that it has done me good.

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,354
And I say, God bless it.

58
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,390
Not a sound from you.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,589
And you'll keep your Christmas
by losing your situation.

60
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,668
You're a powerful speaker.
I wonder you don't go into Parliament.

61
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,390
Please don't be angry, Uncle.
Come. Dine with us tomorrow.

62
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,950
Dine? I'd see myself in hell first.

63
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,516
It would be a great joy to me.
And to my wife.

64
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,279
Yes, your wife.

65
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,637
I'm told she brought little
to the marriage. A poor girl.

66
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,393
I love her.

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,388
And she loves me.

68
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,794
Love.

69
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,632
Good afternoon, Nephew.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,997
I want nothing from you.

71
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,992
I ask nothing of you.

72
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,191
- Why can't we be friends?
- You are wasting my time.

73
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,995
I'm sorry to find you so resolute.

74
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,589
We've never had a quarrel,
so far as I know.

75
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,597
And so I shall keep my good humor
and wish you a merry Christmas.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,197
- Goodbye.
- And a happy New Year.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,197
- How's that fine family of yours?
- Well. All very well.

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,238
- You'll give them my best wishes?
- Yes, I shall.

79
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,277
- Goodbye, Cratchit.
- Goodbye, sir.

80
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,198
And a merry Christmas.

81
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,999
Idiot.

82
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,193
And he's made me late to Bushnel.

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,791
I'm off to the Exchange.

84
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,993
- Don't lock up a moment early.
- No, sir.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,072
You'll want all day tomorrow,
I suppose?

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,792
- If it's quite convenient, sir.
- It is not convenient.

87
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,792
And it's not fair.

88
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,152
If I were to hold back half a crown
from your pay for it...

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,909
...you'd think yourself ill-used.
But you don't think me ill-used...

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,833
...when I pay a day's wages
for no work.

91
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,078
Christmas comes once a year.

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,794
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,637
But I suppose you must have it.

94
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,031
- Be here earlier the next morning.
- Yes, sir, I shall.

95
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,396
- Make sure.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,999
- And a merry Christmas to you.
- Humbug!

97
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,875
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,792
Don't beg on this corner, boy.

99
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,396
I'm not begging, sir.
I'm Tim. Tim Cratchit.

100
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,352
I'm waiting for my father.

101
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,154
Tim Cratchit, huh? Well then,
you'll have a long wait, won't you?

102
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,991
- Thank you, sir.
- Humbug.

103
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,397
<i>Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas day</i>

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,831
<i>Our Savior Christ and His Lady
On Christmas day in the morning</i>

105
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,998
Clear the road. Out of the way.
Let me through.

106
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,598
Merry Christmas, sir.

107
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,992
Merry Christmas, sir.

108
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,313
The 18th of January.
The 18th of January.

109
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,832
The open market. Open market?
Buying here. Buying.

110
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,795
- We were afraid you weren't coming.
- It's almost closing, sir.

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,877
- I'm here.
- I said you'd be here.

112
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,432
- I knew you'd change your mind.
- You're right. I've changed my mind.

113
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,399
- Then you'll take our bid?
- The price has gone up.

114
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,392
Gone up? That's not possible.

115
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,108
You want my corn,
you must meet my quote.

116
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,237
Plus five percent for the delay.

117
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,512
You'll be left with a warehouse
stuffed with corn.

118
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,910
- That's my affair.
- If we pay your price...

119
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,634
...our bread will be dearer.
The poor will suffer.

120
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,598
Buy the corn someplace else.

121
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,028
Scrooge, a moment.

122
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,352
We'll take your corn at the price
you quoted yesterday.

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,597
Too late. Tomorrow it'll cost
you another five percent.

124
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,915
It's not fair!

125
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,390
No. But it's business.

126
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,393
I'll give you a moment
to make up your minds.

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,635
All right, Scrooge. Done and done.

128
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,199
Very good, gentlemen.

129
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,312
Now make sure that the draw
for this transaction...

130
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,078
...is deposited with my clerk.

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,996
I don't ship until I have the cash
in hand. Good day.

132
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,830
- Mr. Scrooge, I presume?
- Indeed you do, sir.

133
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,389
- You don't know us.
- Nor do I wish to.

134
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,393
My name is Poole,
and this is Mr. Hacking.

135
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,438
- Excellent. Now allow me to pass.
- Let me explain.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,231
At this festive season of the year,
it seems desirable...

137
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,671
...that those of us with means
should make some provision...

138
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,799
...for the poor and destitute
who suffer greatly at this time.

139
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,190
Are you seeking money from me?

140
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
Thousands are in want
of common necessaries...

141
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,391
...and in want of common comforts.

142
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,790
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.

143
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,394
- Are the workhouses in operation?
I wish I could say no.

144
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,192
The treadmill, the poorhouses...

145
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,198
...still in full vigor?
- All very busy, sir.

146
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,192
I was afraid from what you said...

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,868
...that something had stopped them
in full force.

148
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,640
A few of us are endeavoring
to raise a fund...

149
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,513
...to buy the poor some meat, drink,
food and warmth.

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,228
- What can we put you down for, sir?
- Nothing.

151
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,199
- You wish to be anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

152
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,238
Since you asked me what I wish,
that is my answer.

153
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,630
I don't make merry myself
at Christmas...

154
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,308
...and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

155
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,870
My taxes help to support
the public institutions.

156
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,229
And they cost enough.

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,550
Those who are badly off must go there.

158
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,510
Many can't go there.
And many would rather die.

159
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,595
Well, if they would rather die,
perhaps they had better do so...

160
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,791
...and decrease
the surplus population.

161
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,235
You don't mean that?
- With all my heart.

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,630
Now if you will
go about your business...

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,990
...and allow me to go about mine.
Good day.

164
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,392
Father!

165
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,118
Tim.

166
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,032
You must be frozen.

167
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,589
I'm all right now.

168
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,628
Can we go home by Corn Hill and watch
the children play in the snow?

169
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,791
Of course we can.

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,038
Tim, I'm to have
the whole day off tomorrow.

171
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,795
We'll be together,
the whole family for the entire day!

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,709
Hurrah for Christmas,
the best day of the year!

173
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,270
- Look.
- They're having such fun, Father.

174
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,991
Go on, catch it.

175
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,233
You'll be there one day, playing
with the other children.

176
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,198
I'm sure I will.

177
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,796
I feel I'm getting stronger every day.

178
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,558
We must go home now.
Your mother will be waiting.

179
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,115
Yes. It's time to go home.

180
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,716
Scrooge.

181
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,953
Ebenezer Scrooge.

182
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,998
Who's calling me?

183
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,191
Someone call my name?

184
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,994
<i>Scrooge.</i>

185
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,036
<i>Scrooge.</i>

186
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,999
Scrooge.

187
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,398
Marley?

188
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,790
<i>Scrooge.</i>

189
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,878
Humbug.

190
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,990
It's humbug! I won't believe it!

191
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,398
What do you want with me?

192
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,593
Much.

193
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,995
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

194
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,190
You are particular for a ghost.
Who are you then?

195
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,434
In life, I was your partner,
Jacob Marley.

196
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,073
- Well, can you sit down?
- I can.

197
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,992
Well, do it then.

198
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,198
You don't believe in me.

199
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,799
I don't.

200
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,078
What evidence would you have
of my reality...

201
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,630
...beyond that of your own senses?
- I don't know.

202
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,314
Why do you doubt your senses?

203
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,790
Because a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach.

204
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,710
You might be a bit of bad beef
or a blot of mustard...

205
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,195
...or a fragment
of an underdone potato.

206
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,713
There's more of gravy than a grave
about you, whatever you are. Humbug!

207
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,393
Mercy.

208
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,594
Dreadful apparition.
Why do you trouble me?

209
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,594
Man of the worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?!

210
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,994
I do! I must!

211
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,077
But why do spirits walk the earth?
Why do you come to me?

212
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,715
It is required of every man...

213
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,838
...that the spirit within him
should walk abroad...

214
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,789
...among his fellow men
and travel far and wide.

215
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,833
And if that spirit
goes not forth in life...

216
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,799
...it is condemned
to do so after death.

217
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,839
It is doomed to wander
through the world...

218
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,799
...and witness what it cannot share.

219
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,798
What might have shared.

220
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,597
And turn to happiness.

221
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,870
You're chained. Tell me why?

222
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,157
I wear the chain I forged in life.

223
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,919
I made it link by link
and yard by yard.

224
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,357
Is its pattern strange to you...

225
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,869
...or would you know
the weight and length...

226
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,116
...of the strong coil
you bear yourself?

227
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,632
It was as full, as heavy...

228
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,599
...and as long as this
seven Christmas Eves ago.

229
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,315
You have labored on it since.
It is a ponderous chain!

230
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,073
I see no chain.

231
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,675
Mine were invisible...

232
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,229
...until the day of my death...

233
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,596
...as yours shall be.

234
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,999
Jacob.

235
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,588
Tell me more. Speak comfort to me.

236
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,034
I have none to give.

237
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,992
My spirit...

238
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,596
...never walked
beyond our countinghouse.

239
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,918
In life, my spirit never roved
beyond the narrow limits...

240
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,033
...of our money-changing hole.

241
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,317
No doubt of that.
You were a good man of business.

242
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,834
Business?!

243
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,277
Mankind was my business.

244
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,239
The common welfare was my business.

245
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,679
Charity, mercy, forbearance
and benevolence were all my business.

246
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,112
The dealings of my trade
were but a drop of water...

247
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,478
...in the comprehensive ocean
of my business!

248
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,990
I'm sorry for you, Jacob.
Is there anything I can do for you?

249
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,874
For me?

250
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,669
Nay. It is too late.

251
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,798
But I have come...

252
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,914
...for your sake, Ebenezer.

253
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,357
Have you?
Well, you always were a good friend.

254
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,590
As part of my penance...

255
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,197
...I have been sent to warn you.
- And so you have.

256
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,594
And to offer you a hope and chance
of escaping my fate...

257
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,400
...you will be haunted
by three spirits.

258
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,392
Three spirits? Is that the chance
and hope you mention?

259
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,436
It is.

260
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,710
In that case, I think I'd rather not.

261
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,117
Expect the first tonight...

262
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,112
...when the bell tolls one.

263
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,317
Couldn't they all come
at the same time and have it over?

264
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,237
Expect the second
on the stroke of two.

265
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,119
The third, more mercurial...

266
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,790
...shall appear in his own good time.

267
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,588
Look to me no more.

268
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,798
Look that you may remember...

269
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,589
...what has passed between us.

270
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,792
Humbug.

271
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,391
Something I ate.

272
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,388
One.

273
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,197
What was it Marley said?

274
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,994
Nothing.

275
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,398
Just a dream.

276
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,397
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

277
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,439
I am.

278
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,113
Who and what are you?

279
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,193
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

280
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,911
- Long past?
- No. Your past.

281
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,716
Perhaps you would do me the favor...

282
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,390
...of placing upon your head that cap
that you hold in your hand.

283
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,029
I bring the light of truth.

284
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,556
Would you use this cap to put it out?

285
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,397
I beg your pardon.
I had no intention of offending.

286
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,796
What business brings you here?

287
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,799
- It is for your welfare that I appear.
- I can think of no greater welfare...

288
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,600
...than a night
of uninterrupted sleep.

289
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,475
Be careful, Ebenezer Scrooge.
I speak of your reclamation.

290
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,836
Well, if it's reclamation, then...

291
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,798
...let's get on with it.

292
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,998
Come.

293
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,592
We shall be invisible...

294
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,195
...and silent as the grave.

295
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,388
You will now see a child, a youth.

296
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,396
You will see yourself, Ebenezer.

297
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,955
The air is so clean.
How different from the city.

298
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,915
Do you know where you are?

299
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,718
Of course, I...

300
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,758
I was bred here.
I was a boy in this place.

301
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,033
That's Daniel Costas.
And Robert Estes.

302
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,191
Hello, Daniel.

303
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,996
The big one there, that's David Tyler.

304
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,879
David, look here! It's Ebenezer!

305
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,790
I told you, Ebenezer.
They can't hear you.

306
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,399
How happy they all seem.

307
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,750
That's right. They do.

308
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,389
Yes, well, it's time to move on.

309
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,319
Come along, Ebenezer.
You know the way.

310
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,791
I could walk it blindfolded.

311
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,113
Your school.

312
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,469
I remember.

313
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,915
And it's Christmas Day.

314
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,799
There's a boy in there, neglected.

315
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,596
The boy is deserted
by his friends and his family.

316
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,952
His mother is dead.
His father holds him a grudge.

317
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,312
Why does his father
hold him a grudge?

318
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,913
She died in childbirth.

319
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,272
His birth.

320
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,195
Weep for the boy,
if the tears will come.

321
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,194
He has his friends, even on this day.

322
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,597
All his beloved books.

323
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,072
His Ali Baba.

324
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,198
Dear old honest Ali Baba.

325
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,836
The Sultan's groom,
turned upside down for Genie.

326
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,919
But not a real child to talk to.
Not a living person.

327
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,795
Robinson Crusoe, not real?

328
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,715
And Friday? And the parrot...

329
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,599
...with green body and yellow tail?
Not real?

330
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,911
He made do, this boy.

331
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,754
Let us see another Christmas Day...

332
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,433
...when you were a youth.

333
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,799
Fan.

334
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,398
- Fan!
- Dear, dear brother!

335
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,594
I've come to bring you home,
dear brother.

336
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,592
To bring you home.

337
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,392
Home.

338
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,992
Home, little Fan?

339
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,719
Yes.

340
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,315
Home for good and all.

341
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,438
Father's much kinder
than he used to be.

342
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,830
He spoke to me so gently one night...

343
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,311
...I was not afraid to ask once more
if you might come home.

344
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,513
And he said yes, you should.
And sent me in a coach to bring you.

345
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,914
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

346
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,434
And you...

347
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,716
...are to be a man now.

348
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,708
And never come back here.

349
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,196
Come. We mustn't keep Father waiting.

350
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,119
Father!

351
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,755
There, boy, down. Stand still now.

352
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,154
Let me look at you.

353
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,673
They haven't been overfeeding you,
that's certain.

354
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,756
I've grown. I think.

355
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,195
Yes, most boys do.

356
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,637
- You know you won't move back here.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,116
It's time you made your way.
I've arranged an apprenticeship.

358
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,352
You'll move into Mr. Fezziwig's
in three days.

359
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,794
Three days, Father?

360
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,275
I'd hoped we'd have him home
for longer.

361
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,708
Longer?

362
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,157
Three days is quite long enough
for both of us.

363
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,719
Don't you think, Ebenezer?

364
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,919
Yes, sir.

365
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,717
Quite long enough.

366
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,872
- Finished back there?
All safe and secure, sir.

367
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,399
Into the carriage, Fan.

368
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,313
Be on our way.

369
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,110
Into the carriage, boy.

370
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,114
Giddyap!

371
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,549
Fan pleaded for more time,
but my father was a very...

372
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,916
...stern man.

373
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,832
- And Fan...
- She died a young woman.

374
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,038
She had such a generous nature.
Yes, too young.

375
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,789
- Old enough to bear a child.
- One son.

376
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,600
- Fred, your nephew.
- Fred Holywell, yes.

377
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,519
Who bears a strong resemblance
to your sister.

378
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,951
Does he? I never noticed.

379
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,713
You never noticed?

380
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,157
<i>I think you've gone through life
with your eyes closed.</i>

381
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,710
<i>Open them. Open them wide.</i>

382
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,639
<i>You know this man.</i>

383
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,314
<i>It's old Fezziwig.</i>

384
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,118
Oh, yes, my dear.

385
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,433
Would you ask Mr. Peuring to refer
that matter to Mr. Scrooge?

386
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,159
Thank you, my dear.

387
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,152
<i>And you know this place.</i>

388
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,039
<i>Know it? Was I not apprenticed here?</i>

389
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,157
Yoo-hoo!

390
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,109
Pay attention, everybody!
Dick? Ebenezer? Pens down.

391
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,909
No more work tonight, boys.
It is Christmas Eve.

392
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,720
So close those ledgers down.

393
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,633
Clear away in here, everybody.
We need the room.

394
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,599
Here we go, lad.

395
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,196
You'll enjoy yourself tonight,
Ebenezer. That is an order.

396
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,908
- Yes, sir. I'll try.
- Put your heart in it.

397
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,159
You put enough of yourself into your
work, and I have nothing but praise...

398
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,958
...but you're young.

399
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,637
There's more to life than
books of cloth and musty old ledgers.

400
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,229
It's Mrs. Fezziwig and the
three daughters and their suitors.

401
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,517
And a happy Christmas to you all!

402
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,716
And Belle.

403
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,792
I had forgotten...

404
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,395
...how beautiful she was.

405
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,398
Hello, Belle.

406
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,834
Hello.

407
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,310
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.

408
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,912
How long since you've danced,
Ebenezer?

409
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,997
A waste of time, dancing.

410
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,515
You didn't think so then.

411
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,995
There was a reason then.

412
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,193
You've changed since you've come
to Fezziwig's. You were so gloomy.

413
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,831
I think I should warn you, Miss Belle.
I am of a serious bent of mind.

414
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,152
I consider seriousness
an admirable trait of character.

415
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,630
But it can be overdone.

416
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,953
I shall take heed of your advice
and go through life with a grin.

417
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,756
Come, you two! They're striking up
Sir Roger de Coverly.

418
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,959
Time enough to sample the punch
when you're old and fat like me.

419
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,398
I best partner my wife before that
young scamp goes dancing off with her.

420
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,952
What a difference it makes, Ebenezer,
to travel the rough road of life...

421
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,988
...with the right female
to help bear the burden.

422
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,913
What a lucky man I am!

423
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,709
Shall we join the others?

424
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,916
My pleasure, Miss Belle.

425
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,512
Old Fezziwig.

426
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,109
A silly man.

427
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,837
Silly? Why silly?

428
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,789
What did he do to deserve the praises
of those apprentices?

429
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,912
Spent a few pounds?

430
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,828
Dance like a monkey?

431
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,430
Beamed a great smile?

432
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,037
Well, the happiness he gives... Gave...

433
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,915
Was quite as great as though
it had cost 1000 pounds.

434
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,434
Just small things.

435
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,316
- Belle.
- Are you in love, Ebenezer?

436
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,713
- The thought had occurred to me.
- She's too good for you.

437
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,157
One day, when I've made my fortune...

438
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,436
...then I'll deserve her.

439
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,240
It was a night never to be forgotten.

440
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,118
Never.

441
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,712
<i>But you did forget. Often.
Huh?</i>

442
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,191
<i>Look. Another Christmas Eve...</i>

443
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,716
<i>...delayed by the pressure
of business.</i>

444
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,349
<i>- Do you remember?
- No.</i>

445
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,434
Hello, Belle.

446
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,750
<i>Now do you remember?</i>

447
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,638
I'm sorry I'm late.

448
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,759
I thought you might not come.
I know how busy you are.

449
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,513
Well...

450
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,316
...the time of year,
and the nature of my business.

451
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,030
It's important now that I use my time
and opportunities wisely.

452
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,919
Another idol has displaced me.

453
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,233
- What idol has displaced you?
- A golden one.

454
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,558
All your hopes have merged
into a master passion: profit.

455
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,518
The thought of money engrosses you.

456
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,440
Perhaps I've become wiser.

457
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,796
But I've not changed towards you.

458
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,830
Our contract is an old one.

459
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,312
It was made when we were young
and our prospects limited.

460
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,917
How often I've thought of those times.

461
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,150
If there had been
no understanding between us...

462
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,994
...would you seek me out
and try to win me now?

463
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,315
A dowerless girl with nothing but
myself to bring to a marriage?

464
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,593
You have no answer?

465
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,519
- You think I would not?
- Oh, what a safe and terrible answer.

466
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,993
So characteristic of the careful man.

467
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,116
Ebenezer, I release you.

468
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,311
You are a free man.

469
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,519
I let you go with a full heart.

470
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,350
May you be happy
in the life you have chosen.

471
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,314
I almost went after her.

472
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,835
"Almost" carries no weight.

473
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,675
Especially in matters of the heart.

474
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,788
And you did have a heart, didn't you?

475
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,513
Why didn't you follow her?

476
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,431
Upon his death, my father...

477
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,511
...left me a small inheritance.

478
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,355
Belle wished to be married,
insisting we'd get by on very little.

479
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,195
But I wanted something more
for both of us. So I...

480
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,839
...lent out that money.

481
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,551
Laid the foundations for financial
success, which I have achieved.

482
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,077
- Congratulations.
- And I'll thank you not to sneer.

483
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,998
- Show me no more. Conduct me home.
- You have explained what you gained.

484
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,710
Now I will show you
what you have lost.

485
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,196
<i>Belle.
Yes, Belle.</i>

486
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,311
<i>And those are her children!</i>

487
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,911
Oh, darling, he's wonderful!
Isn't he?

488
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
<i>Oh, Lord, what a brood!</i>

489
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,556
Hello, hello. Hello, my dear.

490
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,315
Hello, Papa. Where's my present?
Where's my present?

491
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,711
You will have to wait until tonight.
All of you.

492
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,957
Presents on Christmas Eve, as usual.

493
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,718
Fancy.

494
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,754
They might've been mine.

495
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,393
The same thought occurred to me.

496
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,592
I saw an old friend of yours
in the city this afternoon.

497
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,717
- Who was it?
- Guess.

498
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,911
I can't.

499
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,714
I don't know.

500
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,078
- Ebenezer Scrooge?
- Mr. Scrooge it was.

501
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,114
I passed his office window
and it was not shuttered.

502
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,238
He had a single candle
lit upon his desk.

503
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,836
His partner, Jacob Marley,
lies on the point of death.

504
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,514
And there he sat.
Ebenezer Scrooge, alone.

505
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,518
Quite alone in the world,
I do believe.

506
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,711
Poor Ebenezer.

507
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,192
Poor, wretched man.

508
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,716
Spare me your pity!
I have no need of it!

509
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,433
They can't hear you.

510
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,356
And as for you, I've had enough
of your pictures from the past!

511
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,113
Leave me!

512
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,117
Haunt me no longer!

513
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,908
<i>Truth lives!</i>

514
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,913
<i>Truth lives!</i>

515
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,118
<i>Truth lives!</i>

516
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,114
<i>Truth lives!</i>

517
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,516
A nightmare.

518
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,709
A horrible nightmare.

519
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,512
God...

520
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,916
...let me sleep.

521
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,753
Let me sleep in peace.

522
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,718
Peace.

523
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,313
Two.

524
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,516
Well, Jacob Marley...

525
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,110
...where is this spirit
of which you spoke so glibly?

526
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,310
You did say at the stroke of two,
didn't you, Jacob?

527
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,515
Mistaken in death...

528
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,312
...as you were in life, old partner.

529
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,313
Ebenezer Scrooge!

530
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,150
Ebenezer Scrooge!

531
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,718
Come in!

532
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,315
I intend to.

533
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,190
Come in and know me better, man!

534
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,117
You've never seen
the likes of me before?

535
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,389
That's quite true. I have not.

536
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,631
You never walked forth...

537
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,440
...with any of the
younger members of my family?

538
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,558
Not that I remember.

539
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,918
Nor any of my elder brothers
born these later years?

540
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,919
No, I'm afraid not. No.

541
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,035
Do you have many brothers, spirit?

542
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,239
Over 1800!

543
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,636
Tremendous family to provide for.

544
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,913
Take hold of my robe, Ebenezer Scrooge.

545
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,711
What day is it now?

546
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,718
Don't you know?

547
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,953
Christmas morning.

548
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,319
There's a lot of buying, isn't there?

549
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,310
Oh, Ebenezer, is that all you can see?

550
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,838
Follow me, and I'll show you
to what good use...

551
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,911
...these wares can be put.

552
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,157
Does some peculiar power
emanate from your torch?

553
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,919
Oh, yes...

554
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,519
...there is.

555
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,231
Do you know this house?
No, I can't say I do.

556
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,355
It is the house of Bob Cratchit.

557
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,838
Is it? He does very well
on 15 bob a week.

558
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,358
Shall we go in?

559
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,994
- I wouldn't want to disturb them.
- As with Christmas Past...

560
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,312
...we shall be invisible and unheard.

561
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,593
- I wonder what's keeping your father?
- Probably talking to the parson.

562
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,752
Father always likes to compliment him
on his sermons.

563
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,916
I hope the pudding's a success.

564
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,477
No one makes a better pudding
than you, Mother.

565
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,999
Peter?

566
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,318
- Save some for the family.
- Just testing the cooking.

567
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,313
I'm sure they'll manage very well
without your help.

568
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,556
- Hello, Mother!
- Hello, Mother!

569
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,911
- Smell the goose cooking, Martha!
- It makes my mouth water!

570
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,754
- Mine too!
- I can't wait!

571
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,629
You'll just have to. Run along
and help Martha butter the bread.

572
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,068
Here they are!

573
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,950
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- You're late, Bob Cratchit.

574
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,988
Oh, and you're quite like an icicle,
Tim. You've been dawdling.

575
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,708
Father had a long talk
with the minister.

576
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,188
Thought as much.

577
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,034
Tim, listen to the pudding
hissing on the fire!

578
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,919
It's like a giant snake
inside the copper!

579
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,754
Go along with your brother and sister.

580
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,513
Off you go then.

581
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,514
Come on.

582
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,635
- How did he behave in church?
- As good as gold.

583
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,114
Better.

584
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,635
Mama's worried how it will turn out.

585
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,714
- Look how they support him.
- What did you say?

586
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,116
Nothing. It's...

587
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,829
...nothing.

588
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,038
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much.

589
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,918
He thinks the strangest things.

590
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,479
He said he hoped the people in church
saw him because he was a cripple...

591
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,708
...and that it might be pleasant for
them to remember on Christmas Day...

592
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,957
...who it was
that made lame beggars walk...

593
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,316
...and blind men see.

594
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,357
It seems to me that Tim
is getting stronger every day.

595
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,116
That his limbs are growing. That he's
in better spirits, it seems to me.

596
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,959
Yes, Bob. I'm sure you're right.

597
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,918
He is getting stronger.

598
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,912
Well, we're all here.
That's the important thing.

599
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,716
- Belinda, help me with the goose.
Yes, Mother.

600
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,514
Peter, I have some good news for you.

601
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,917
I met by chance, this morning
at church, a fine gentleman.

602
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,709
Fred Holywell by name.
He's a nephew of our own Mr. Scrooge.

603
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,838
He remembered I have a son
coming of working age...

604
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,312
...and told me he had a position at
three shillings and six pence weekly.

605
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,478
Three shillings and six pence
every week?

606
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,751
So if you are agreeable...

607
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,230
...you may start work on Monday next.

608
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,232
Now I can help you and Mother.

609
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,233
More important...

610
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,199
...you shall be embarking
on a fine career.

611
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,513
To start a boy
at three and six pence a week.

612
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,119
Typical of my nephew. No wonder he's
never been able to put by a penny.

613
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,914
Perhaps he's "put by" more than money.

614
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,519
Fred?

615
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,629
He's doing this to spite me, you know?

616
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,317
Employing the son of my employee
at an exorbitant wage.

617
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,516
Come and get it!

618
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,508
Quiet, quiet, quiet, children. Quiet.

619
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,319
- A wonderful goose!
- It's enough for an army!

620
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,318
- Mother, you've outdone yourself!
- It's all right then?

621
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,318
Hurry, Father, cut the goose!
I can't wait!

622
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,915
Haven't we forgotten something?

623
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,516
Lord, we thank you for the bounty
you have placed before us.

624
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,712
We thank you for this day
of love and joy...

625
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,516
...for allowing us to be together, to
share with each other and with you...

626
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,514
...the fullness of our hearts
on this special day.

627
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,318
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,993
Amen.

629
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,276
- Amen.
- What?

630
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,755
You say something?

631
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,839
No, no.

632
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,599
I thought I heard you...

633
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,512
No, I said nothing.

634
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,319
Oh.

635
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,509
- Potato.
- Peter.

636
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,917
Alice.

637
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,720
- Belinda.
Potato, Alice?

638
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,640
It's a very small goose.

639
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,997
It's all Bob Cratchit can afford.

640
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,434
Me.

641
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,550
- Are we all served?
- Yes.

642
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,950
Then let's begin.

643
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,957
And a merry Christmas to us all.

644
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,838
A merry Christmas to us all.

645
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,436
And God bless us, everyone.

646
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,717
Tell me, spirit.

647
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,589
Will he live?

648
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,359
I see a vacant place at this table.

649
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,190
I see a crutch without an owner,
carefully preserved.

650
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,234
If these shadows...

651
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,836
...remain unaltered by the future,
the child will die.

652
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,519
No.

653
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,352
Say he will be spared.

654
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,433
If these shadows remain
unaltered by the future...

655
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,911
...none other of my species
will find him here.

656
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,635
But if he is to die,
then let him die...

657
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,678
...and decrease
the surplus population.

658
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,318
You use my own words against me.

659
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,037
Yes. So perhaps in the future
you will hold your tongue...

660
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,795
...until you have discovered
what the surplus population is...

661
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,713
...and where it is.

662
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,155
It may be
that in the sight of heaven...

663
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,710
...you are more worthless
and less fit to live...

664
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,999
...than millions
like this poor man's child.

665
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,519
A triumph, my dear. Another triumph!

666
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,553
I told you so, Mother.

667
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,836
It's a success.

668
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,230
What a relief for Mrs. Cratchit.

669
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,233
Now their feast is over.

670
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,708
Not quite.

671
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,316
Just one more ceremonious moment.

672
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,913
Look.

673
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,548
Now I would like to propose a toast
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge...

674
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,597
...the founder of our feast.

675
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,319
Mr. Scrooge.

676
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,110
The "founder of our feast" indeed.

677
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,993
I wish I had him here.

678
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,518
I'd give him a piece of my mind
and hope he had a good appetite for it.

679
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,075
My dear, the children.
It's Christmas Day.

680
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,109
It should be Christmas Day when one
drinks to the health of such...

681
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,118
...a stingy, odious, mean...

682
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,432
...hard, unfeeling man
as Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

683
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,318
My dear, have some charity.

684
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,319
Well, well.

685
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,716
I'll drink his health for your
sake, and the day's sake...

686
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,717
...but not for his.

687
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,317
Long life, Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

688
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,518
A merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

689
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,077
I have no doubt his Christmas will be
very merry, and he'll be very happy.

690
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,599
Mr. Scrooge.

691
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,394
Mr. Scrooge.

692
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,834
Mr. Scrooge.

693
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,638
Mr. Scrooge.

694
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,199
Mr. Scrooge.

695
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,312
Mr. Scrooge.

696
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,753
He's made a point, Bob Cratchit has.

697
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,356
Without me, there would be no feast.
No goose at all.

698
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,592
My head for business
has furnished him employment.

699
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,833
Is that all you've learned by
observing this family on Christmas Day?

700
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,433
Well, no. Not all.

701
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,719
But one must speak up for one's self,
for one's life.

702
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,396
<i>Here we come a wassailing
Among the leaves so green</i>

703
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,916
<i>Here we come a wandering
So fair to be seen</i>

704
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,908
<i>Love and joy come to you
And a merry Christmas too</i>

705
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,789
<i>And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year</i>

706
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,116
We have some time left.

707
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,914
Take my robe.

708
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,908
<i>Love and joy come to you
And a merry Christmas too</i>

709
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,948
<i>And God bless you and send you
A happy New Year</i>

710
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,914
- Where are we now?
- Just a street.

711
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,190
Any street.

712
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,512
This house. We're going here.

713
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,315
- I think it might amuse you.
- I am in no mood to be amused.

714
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,755
Is my playing so amusing?
- I'm sorry, my love.

715
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,509
I was thinking of his face yesterday.
Humbug, he said. Humbug.

716
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,355
He said Christmas was a humbug.
He believed it too.

717
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,158
I'd like to meet your uncle. The way
you portray him tickles my heart.

718
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,349
He is comical.

719
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,797
- But not pleasant.
- His offenses are their own punishment.

720
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,395
Brother-in-law,
it's said he's very rich.

721
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,313
That's true.
But his wealth is of no use to him.

722
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,432
He does no good and
doesn't even make himself comfortable.

723
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,955
I don't squander it,
if that's what you mean.

724
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,909
You mustn't argue with those we visit.
It's useless and tactless.

725
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,549
- Tact is a quality I despise.
- I can see.

726
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,877
- I have no patience with him.
- I feel sorry for him.

727
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,719
Sor...? Sorry for me?

728
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,997
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Himself. Always.

729
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,313
He takes it in his heart to dislike us
and not come and dine with us.

730
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,516
And loses a very good dinner.

731
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,996
The reason I talk about him so...

732
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,711
...is that my mother,
God rest her saintly soul...

733
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,758
...was very fond of him.
She loved him.

734
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,559
It's true.

735
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,510
Fan loved me and I her.

736
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,396
Dear Fan.
I wish she were alive today.

737
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,710
Fred looks very like her.

738
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,988
Yes.

739
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,113
I've been reminded of that
just recently.

740
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,912
The consequences
of his taking a dislike to us...

741
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,591
...and not making merry with us is
that he loses some pleasant moments...

742
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,910
...which could do him no harm.

743
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,315
I'll give him the chance every year
whether he likes it or not.

744
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,557
And every year he'll say, "Christmas!

745
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,519
Bah, humbug!"

746
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,910
Come, we must see to our guests.

747
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,154
Nougats?

748
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,552
So much noise.

749
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,758
- I can't hear myself think.
- They seem to be happy.

750
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,710
I suppose free food and drink is an
occasion for pleasure to most people.

751
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,759
Happy in each other's company, I mean.

752
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,192
Everyone, hush. We shall have
a word game. What shall it be?

753
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,317
Simile.
Does everyone know the rules?

754
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,115
You each have five seconds to answer.
I'll ask the question.

755
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,915
- Mr. Topper, you'll keep count.
- I shall do my best.

756
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,756
You have five seconds. If you fail
to give an acceptable answer...

757
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,150
...then you must
stand behind your chair.

758
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,518
- Last one seated wins the prize.
- Fred, don't go on. Just begin.

759
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,439
I'm sorry, my love. Yes, I shall.

760
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,517
And now...

761
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,235
Proud as...?

762
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,352
Proud as a peacock.

763
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,918
Peter? Dry as...?

764
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,310
- As a bone.
- Good.

765
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,355
- Plump as...?
- My wife!

766
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,790
Sorry, my dear. Just a little joke.

767
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,359
Plump as...

768
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,999
- One, two...
- Two seconds!

769
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,117
A partridge.

770
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,318
Quick as...?

771
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,316
- Wind?
- No!

772
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,112
One, two...

773
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,117
...three, four...

774
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,912
...five!

775
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,390
- A wink, you idiot.
- Ebenezer, shh.

776
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,036
- You said they couldn't see or hear us.
- That's quite true.

777
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,151
Oh, yes. Sorry.

778
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,315
Even I forget regulations sometimes.
After all, I do not come back often.

779
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,670
I'm trying to listen to the game.

780
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,352
Modest as...?

781
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,352
- A maiden.
- No.

782
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,712
- I'm sure it's a well-known simile.
- I was thinking of modest as a violet.

783
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,312
Fred.

784
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,910
However, I will accept your answer.

785
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,118
Janet?

786
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,554
Attend. Tight as...?

787
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,633
Tight as...

788
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,519
A drum. Anyone knows that.

789
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,315
Tight as...?

790
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,229
Not very bright, my nephew's wife.

791
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,313
Tight as your Uncle Scrooge's
purse strings!

792
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,558
That's quite wrong.
And your time is up.

793
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,314
You've lost and must stand
behind your chair.

794
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,715
Tight as a drum
is what I was thinking of.

795
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,151
Good for you, Fred.
Boy's got a head on his shoulders.

796
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,311
As for the laughter at my expense...

797
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,358
...I'll overlook it
in view of the general gaiety.

798
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,160
It's time to leave
this pleasant scene.

799
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,631
We have one more visit to make
before my time is done.

800
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,518
Take hold of my robe.

801
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,790
Sly as...?
A fox!

802
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,315
- Red as...?
- Red as a rose.

803
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,312
- Silent as...?
The night.

804
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,509
- No!
- A mouse!

805
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,438
- Not at all.
- I know. The grave.

806
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,912
Where are we now?

807
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,239
I'm sure I don't know this place.

808
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,155
The name would mean nothing to you.
It's a place...

809
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,920
...like many in this world.

810
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,517
- Do we have enough wood for the night?
- It'll last.

811
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,718
At least there's one thing
still free in this country.

812
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,359
Mary, a piece of that cooked.

813
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,512
- They're too hot.
- It'll be cold soon enough.

814
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,951
- Where did you get these, Father?
- I didn't steal them.

815
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,519
She didn't say you did.

816
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,917
- She should have some respect.
- Don't berate the girl.

817
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,196
They fell from a cart into the road.

818
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,908
Your father's not a thief, girl.

819
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,914
Not yet.

820
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,315
Why are these people out here?

821
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,713
Men and women in rags.
Children eating scraps!

822
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,309
There are institutions.

823
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,910
Have you visited any of them,
these institutions you speak of?

824
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,192
No! I'm taxed for them.
Isn't that enough?

825
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,628
Is it?

826
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,109
- Ben, come back to the fire.
- Look at these hands.

827
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,959
They're hard hands.
They've done hard work.

828
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,519
I want to work.

829
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,912
I want to have bread for my children.
It's not right that there's no work.

830
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,958
We're together.
That's the important thing.

831
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,033
I love you, Meg. I love the children.

832
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,999
Tomorrow take the children
to the parish poor house.

833
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,151
No. No.

834
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,917
I'd rather we all drowned in the river
than go there and be separated forever.

835
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,310
- Until I get work!
- No.

836
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,314
Ben, we're a family.
We stay together.

837
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,394
Come.

838
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,915
Come back to the fire. Come.

839
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,837
Why do you show me this?
What has it to do with me?

840
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,116
Are they not of the human race?

841
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,838
Look here...

842
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,110
...beneath my robe!

843
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,033
Look upon these!

844
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,353
What are they?

845
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,516
They are your children.

846
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,035
They are the children of all
who walk the earth unseen.

847
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,197
Their names are ignorance...

848
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,714
...and want.

849
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,110
Beware of them.

850
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,314
For upon their brow
is written the word...

851
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,754
..."doom. "

852
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,148
They spell the downfall of you...

853
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,914
...and all who deny their existence.

854
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,679
Have they no refuge? No resource?

855
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,509
Are there no workhouses?

856
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,876
Are there no prisons?

857
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,113
Cover them.
I do not wish to see them.

858
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,515
I thought as much.

859
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,518
They're hidden.

860
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,909
But they live.

861
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,110
Oh, they live.

862
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,719
Well...

863
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,509
...time has come for me to leave you,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

864
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,756
Leave me? Leave me here?

865
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,713
Oh, yes.

866
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,071
Well, you cannot.
Take me back to my bed.

867
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,714
It's too late.

868
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,710
It's cold. The place is strange.
Don't leave me.

869
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,118
Spirit?

870
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,518
Come back.

871
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,709
I wish to talk!

872
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,070
Perhaps...

873
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,517
...I have made a mistake
here and there.

874
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,911
Talked too quickly about matters
which I gave no great thought.

875
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,276
Very well, we'll have a give and take.

876
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,671
Come to some meeting of the minds.

877
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,469
I'm a reasonable man.

878
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,193
Spirit!

879
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,275
Have pity on me.

880
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,277
Don't leave me.

881
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,271
What have I done?

882
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,874
To be abandoned like this?

883
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,473
What?

884
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,479
What?

885
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,316
Are you the spirit which Jacob Marley
foretold would visit me?

886
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,951
I'm in the presence of the Ghost
of Christmas Yet to Come?

887
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:31,148
You'll show me the shadows
of the things that haven't happened...

888
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,872
...but will happen in the time
before us. Is that so?

889
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,071
I fear you.

890
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,516
More than any specter I've seen.

891
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,077
I'm prepared to bear your company.

892
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,671
Will you not speak to me?

893
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,796
Very well, lead on.

894
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,670
The night is waning fast.
Time is precious to me.

895
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,949
I know this place very well. The
Exchange is like a second home to me.

896
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,872
I don't know much about it.
I only know he's dead.

897
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,069
When did he die?

898
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,116
Last night.

899
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,395
What about his money?

900
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,269
Left it to his company, perhaps?
Who else did he have?

901
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,792
It'll likely be a small funeral
if we volunteered and form a party.

902
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,519
I'll go if lunch is provided.

903
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,469
But I insist on being fed
for the time I'll waste.

904
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,477
Have these men
no respect for the dead?

905
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,113
I should go, I suppose.

906
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,079
After all, we did considerable
business together.

907
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,511
Well, I must go and find
the price of corn. Goodbye.

908
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,876
Goodbye.

909
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,078
Why was I privy to their conversation?

910
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,874
What purpose could it have for me?

911
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,674
Merciful heavens, what is this?

912
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,273
Spirit.

913
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,115
This is a fearful place.
I wish to leave.

914
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,993
No, I will not.

915
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,593
This you can't make me do.

916
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,274
I say, I understand.
That is sufficient.

917
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,310
There must be someone who feels
some emotion for this man's death.

918
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,676
I demand to see that person!

919
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,272
This is a foul part of town.
You've made a mistake.

920
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,675
Taken a wrong turn.

921
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,679
In there?

922
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,036
I have no business
to transact in there.

923
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,917
Open it up, Mrs. Dilber.

924
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,072
Am I to pay you for goods
I haven't seen?

925
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,593
You'll not ask me how I came by these?

926
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,469
Every person has a right
to take care of himself.

927
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,119
That's my motto.

928
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,112
- Well, he was dead.
- Yes.

929
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,477
And who's the worst
for the loss of a few things?

930
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,280
- Not a dead man, I suppose.
- No, indeed.

931
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,389
If he wanted to keep them after
he was dead, the wicked old screw...

932
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,950
...why wasn't he more natural
in his lifetime?

933
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,634
He'd have had someone to look after
him when he was struck with death...

934
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,596
...instead of lying there
gasping out his last.

935
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,795
Alone.

936
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,276
By himself.

937
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,877
Those are my things.

938
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,591
She's stolen my things.
I'll have her before a magistrate.

939
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,315
What do you call these?

940
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,515
Bed curtains.

941
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,788
You took them down?
Rings and all, with him lying there?

942
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,950
Why not?

943
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,317
- And don't get wax on his blankets.
- His blankets?

944
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,279
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

945
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,149
I wasn't so fond of him
as I'd loiter about if he did.

946
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,959
What's your offer then?

947
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,076
Those are not my things.

948
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,195
Yes, they are similar...

949
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,557
...but the person she speaks of
could not be me.

950
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,756
A similarity perhaps, but...

951
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,197
One pound five and three. Not a penny
more if I was to be boiled for it.

952
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,952
You're hardened, Joe.
And no mistake.

953
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,790
I'm always kind to the ladies.
That's the way I ruin myself.

954
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,672
Spirit, what perversity is this?

955
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,680
I ask to see some emotion
for this man's death...

956
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,673
...and you show me only
greed and avarice!

957
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,078
Let me see some tenderness!
Some depth of feeling!

958
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,477
There must be some confusion.

959
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,275
Your fellow spirit
brought me here earlier.

960
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,673
Very well.

961
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,670
You're devilishly hard
to have a conversation with.

962
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,235
"Suffer the little children to come
unto me, and forbid them not.

963
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,670
For such is the Kingdom of God.

964
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,876
Verily I say unto you...

965
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,278
...whosoever shall not receive the
Kingdom of God as a little child...

966
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,511
...he shall not enter therein. "

967
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,793
This color hurts my eyes.

968
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,872
It's better now.

969
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,476
This work makes my eyes red.

970
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,270
I wouldn't show red eyes
to your father when he comes home.

971
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,078
Not for the world.

972
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,149
It must be nearly his time.

973
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,398
Past it rather.

974
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,872
I think he walks slower than he
used to these last few evenings.

975
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,588
Yet I've seen him walk home with...

976
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,229
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders
very fast.

977
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,793
And so have I.

978
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,876
And so have I.

979
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,155
And so have I.

980
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,476
But he was very light to carry.

981
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,480
And your father loved him so that...

982
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,069
...it was no trouble.

983
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,072
No trouble.

984
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,559
There is your father now.

985
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,474
Hello, Father.

986
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,472
Hello, my dear.

987
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,273
- Hello, my dear ones.
- Hello, Father.

988
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,272
You're late. We were worried.

989
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,677
- I'm glad you're home, Father.
- I am too.

990
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,877
You've become quite a little armful.

991
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,799
The reason that I'm late is because
I walked by there today.

992
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,153
Today?

993
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,678
I couldn't keep away.

994
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,069
It's so quiet and green.

995
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,993
You shall see it on Sunday.

996
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,276
We shall all go on Sunday.

997
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,678
I promised him that every Sunday
I would walk...

998
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,876
My little child.

999
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,349
My little, little child.

1000
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,516
Father, please don't grieve so.

1001
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,348
I'm sorry.

1002
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,959
I have all of you.

1003
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,110
A blessing to be thankful for.

1004
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,757
Do you know who I saw
in the street today?

1005
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,673
Mr. Scrooge's nephew, Fred.

1006
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,509
And he greeted me
in his usual cheerful way.

1007
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,593
And he saw that I was a little sad.

1008
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,277
He asked me what was distressing me.
And when I told him...

1009
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:24,315
...he said that he was
heartily sorry for it, and...

1010
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,673
Robert.

1011
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,110
Timmy's part of all of us.

1012
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,872
But for his sake,
we must go on living.

1013
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,870
So long as we love one another,
he will always be alive.

1014
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,313
Yes, of course, my dear.

1015
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,910
But however and whenever...

1016
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,272
...we're parted from one another...

1017
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,870
...I'm sure that none of us will
forget poor Tiny Tim.

1018
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,877
No, never. Never.

1019
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,198
And when we recollect how patient
he was, and how mild...

1020
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,670
...although he was
but a little child...

1021
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,310
...I'm sure that we will not easily
quarrel among ourselves.

1022
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,271
I am a happy man.

1023
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,278
I am a truly happy man.

1024
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,871
I asked for tenderness
and depth of feeling.

1025
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,671
And you've shown me that.

1026
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,071
Nothing more I need to see.

1027
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,472
Take me home.

1028
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,272
What is this?

1029
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,477
I thought we agreed that you'd
transport me home?

1030
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,478
Specter.

1031
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:58,276
Something informs me that the moment
of our parting is at hand.

1032
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,875
I know it, but I know not how.

1033
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,272
Tell me.

1034
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,196
What man was that
who we saw lying dead?

1035
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,068
No.

1036
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,316
Before I draw near to that stone,
answer me this:

1037
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,678
Are the things you have shown me the
shadows of the things that will be?

1038
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:31,110
Or are they the shadows
of the things that may be only?

1039
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,589
Men's courses will foreshadow
certain ends. I accept that.

1040
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,113
But if those courses
be departed from...

1041
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,079
...the ends must change.

1042
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,794
Tell me that is so
by what you show me.

1043
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,073
Dear me, I am not the man I was.

1044
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,399
I will not be the man I was
before this visitation.

1045
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,518
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

1046
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,512
Good spirit.

1047
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,877
Your nature intercedes for me
and pities me.

1048
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,909
Say that I may change these things
by an altered life.

1049
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,076
I'll honor Christmas in my heart
and keep it all the year.

1050
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,555
I'll live in the past,
present and future.

1051
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,115
The spirits of all
shall strive within me!

1052
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:07,272
I will not shut out
the lessons that they teach!

1053
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,478
Tell me.

1054
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,119
Tell me that I may sponge away
the writing on this stone!

1055
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,871
Spare me!

1056
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,877
Spare me!

1057
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,872
Spare me! Spare me!

1058
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,672
My own room.

1059
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,918
I'm alive.

1060
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,917
Thank you, spirits.

1061
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,435
I will keep my promise.

1062
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,109
I will live in the past,
present and future.

1063
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,989
The spirits of all three
will strive within me.

1064
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,279
Heaven and Christmastime
will be praised for this.

1065
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,597
I say this on my knees, Jacob Marley.

1066
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,671
On my knees.

1067
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,278
9:00.

1068
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,672
And daylight.

1069
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,675
But what day?

1070
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,476
Hello! You there, boy!

1071
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,510
Me, sir?

1072
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,075
Yes, you, my good fellow.
What day is today?

1073
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,154
Today? It's Christmas Day, of course!

1074
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,073
Christmas Day?

1075
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,878
I haven't missed it.

1076
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,271
The spirits did it all in one night.

1077
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,869
Well, they can do anything they like.

1078
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,877
- Hello, my fine fellow!
- Hello!

1079
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,868
You know the poulterers in the next
street but on the corner?

1080
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,149
I should hope I did!

1081
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,272
Intelligent boy. Remarkable boy.

1082
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,830
Have they sold the prize turkey
that was hanging there?

1083
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,957
What? The one as big as me?

1084
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,279
Delightful boy.
A pleasure talking to him.

1085
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,999
Yes! The one as big as you!

1086
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,519
It's hanging there now.

1087
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,829
Well, go and buy it!

1088
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,669
And bring them around so that
I may tell them where to deliver it.

1089
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,718
Come back with the man
and I'll give you a shilling.

1090
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,748
Come back in less than five minutes,
I'll give you half a crown!

1091
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,516
I must dress. So much to do.

1092
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,671
I don't want to lose any time.

1093
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,074
I'm as light as a feather!

1094
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,274
I'm as happy as an angel.

1095
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,275
I'm as May as a school boy!

1096
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,478
I'm as giddy as a drunken man.

1097
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,800
Merry Christmas to everybody.

1098
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:12,272
And a happy New Year to the world!

1099
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,195
If this be a prank,
I'll box your ears.

1100
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,476
He was in that window. I swear it.

1101
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,676
Ah, there you are.

1102
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,880
This boy says you wish to
purchase this turkey.

1103
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:28,990
Yes, quite right.

1104
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,800
Your half-crown
for a service well rendered.

1105
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,871
- Thank you, sir!
- Splendid boy.

1106
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,470
Now, here's an address
and the price of the turkey.

1107
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,319
Take this fine bird
to Bob Cratchit in Camden.

1108
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,312
The directions are written down.

1109
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,278
- Leave immediately.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,472
And you'll say only
that it comes from a friend.

1111
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,910
And it must be there in time for
Christmas dinner.

1112
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,673
It will be, sir.

1113
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,312
Here's something for your trouble.

1114
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,795
- Thank you, sir.
- Here, all for you.

1115
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,871
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1116
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,871
Wonderful day.

1117
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,197
<i>So grant us all a change of heart</i>

1118
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,630
Good morning. Merry Christmas to you.

1119
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,990
Like angels. Yes, exactly.

1120
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,071
You sing excellently. Here.

1121
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,675
- Thank you, sir.
- It is I who thank you...

1122
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,879
...for that glorious music
on this glorious Christmas Day.

1123
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,079
Good morning.

1124
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,913
Oh, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas to you.

1125
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,676
Mr. Scrooge.

1126
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,075
I feel my name is not pleasant to you.

1127
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,155
I beg your pardons, and please accept
my pledge to the needy for...

1128
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,480
Lord, bless me!

1129
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,794
My dear, Mr. Scrooge!

1130
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,678
Are you quite serious?

1131
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,677
And not a farthing less.

1132
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,071
A great many back payments
are included, I assure you.

1133
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,111
What can I say to such generosity?

1134
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,315
Don't say anything.

1135
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,788
But, dear sir!

1136
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,917
- Will you come and see me?
- We will!

1137
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,912
- We will!
- I am very much obliged.

1138
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,709
- Thank you 50 times!
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1139
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,075
- Yes?
- Bob Cratchit?

1140
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,918
- Yes.
- This is for you.

1141
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,673
There must be some mistake.

1142
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,717
- You are Bob Cratchit?
- Yes.

1143
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,109
There ain't no mistake.

1144
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,514
I didn't order this.

1145
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,594
This here prize turkey was
bought and paid for by a gentleman...

1146
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,389
...to be delivered to you
in time for Christmas dinner.

1147
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,039
What's the gentleman's name?

1148
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,116
Anonymous.

1149
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,715
He wishes to remain anonymous.

1150
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,069
Anonymous you said?

1151
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,709
That's what he said.
An anonymous gentleman.

1152
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,916
- Who could have sent it?
- No idea.

1153
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,116
- Is it a mistake?
- I thought so too.

1154
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,912
It's got our name on it.

1155
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,118
- What shall we do?
- I say we cook it and eat it...

1156
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,710
...and have the best Christmas
feast we've ever had.

1157
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,476
And I say, Mrs. Cratchit,
what a splendid idea.

1158
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,873
And God bless us all, everyone.

1159
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,356
And God bless us all, everyone!

1160
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,073
- Merry Christmas, sir.
- Merry Christmas.

1161
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,272
Merry Christmas.

1162
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,754
Oh, Fred! It's much too expensive.

1163
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,353
But do you like it?

1164
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,272
Oh, I love it!

1165
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,277
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1166
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,870
It belongs upon your wrist,
my darling. Merry Christmas.

1167
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,509
Oh, Fred! I do love you.

1168
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,478
- And not just for this.
- I know.

1169
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,073
I know.

1170
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,279
- Who can that be?
- No one's expected this early.

1171
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,149
My God!

1172
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,272
It's Uncle Ebenezer.

1173
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,278
Your uncle?

1174
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,959
What would he want?

1175
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,479
Open the door, Mary.

1176
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,478
I'm sure I don't know.

1177
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:16,956
Fred.

1178
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,913
Uncle Ebenezer.

1179
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,030
May I come in?

1180
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,559
Yes, come in.

1181
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,479
- Please.
- Thank you.

1182
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,273
Do come in.

1183
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,673
Good afternoon, madame.

1184
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,835
Merry Christmas.

1185
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,478
Merry Christmas to you.

1186
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,476
Uncle Ebenezer,
this is my wife, Janet.

1187
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,075
Janet, this is Uncle Ebenezer.

1188
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,909
It's a pleasure.

1189
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,875
More like a surprise,
wouldn't you say?

1190
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,798
Well, that too.

1191
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,712
Well, that is quite true.

1192
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,916
Quite honestly, it is a surprise.

1193
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,072
When we spoke yesterday,
you made it quite clear...

1194
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,669
...that you wouldn't accept
my invitation.

1195
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,997
I made other things clear too,
didn't I, Fred?

1196
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,994
That Christmas was a humbug,
a waste of time and money.

1197
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,117
A false and commercial festival...

1198
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,470
...devoutly to be ignored.

1199
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,113
Yes, basically that was it.

1200
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,997
I've come for three reasons.

1201
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,277
First, to beg your pardon.

1202
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,431
For what I said about Christmas.

1203
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,348
That was a humbug, Fred.

1204
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,593
- Was it?
- I didn't know it then, but I do now.

1205
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,073
Secondly, I've come to meet your wife.

1206
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,117
- Well, here she is.
- Yes.

1207
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,158
And a very beautiful woman
she is too.

1208
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,472
Thank you.

1209
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,395
I, uh...

1210
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,719
I was in love once.

1211
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,668
Would you believe that?

1212
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,790
Yes.

1213
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,998
But I possessed neither the courage
nor the optimism...

1214
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:58,677
...perhaps the depth of feeling
that you two have.

1215
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,395
Thirdly, if the invitation
to dine is still in force...

1216
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,595
...I accept.

1217
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,518
Of course it's still in force.

1218
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,273
Hurrah!

1219
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,993
I was sure that one day...

1220
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,279
You were sure?
Well, apparently you were right.

1221
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,675
Yes, I should like to dine with you.

1222
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,032
You'll be more than welcome.

1223
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,753
You like games, don't you?

1224
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,356
Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

1225
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,875
Do you ever play Similes?

1226
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,559
It's one of our favorites.

1227
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,155
- Perhaps we could play today.
- Quite possibly.

1228
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,469
I'm very good at it.

1229
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:36,269
And should the phrase
"tight as... " be thrown out...

1230
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,080
...the answer is, a drum.

1231
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,072
Why, yes. So it is.

1232
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,872
Good.

1233
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,670
Forgive me for saying this, but I see
the shadow of my sister in your face.

1234
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,110
I loved your mother, Fred.

1235
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:59,195
For a time there,
I forgot just how much I loved her.

1236
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,476
Perhaps I chose to forget.

1237
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,278
Well, now.

1238
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,916
I should like to sample
some of that famous punch.

1239
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,073
Of course. You've made us both
very happy, Uncle Ebenezer.

1240
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,110
Have I?

1241
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,873
Yes.

1242
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,875
God forgive me
for the time I've wasted.

1243
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,477
9:00. Late again, eh, Cratchit.

1244
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,071
We'll see about this.

1245
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,669
Mr. Cratchit!

1246
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,078
Yes, sir.

1247
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,674
You know what time it is?

1248
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,556
Yes, sir.

1249
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,591
What time is it?

1250
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,391
Eighteen past the hour, sir.

1251
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,870
Eighteen and a half past the hour.

1252
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,759
What do you mean coming here
at this time of day?

1253
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,720
I'm sorry, sir. I am behind my time.

1254
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,309
Yes, I think you are.

1255
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:00,120
Step this way, if you will, please?

1256
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,113
It's only once a year, sir.
It shall not be repeated.

1257
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,079
I was making rather merry yesterday.

1258
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:11,756
Well I'll tell you, my friend,
I won't stand for this any longer.

1259
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,475
Therefore...

1260
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,752
Therefore, I am going to...

1261
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,714
...double your salary!

1262
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,072
Double my salary, sir?

1263
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,832
Yes, Bob!

1264
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,278
A merry Christmas to you!

1265
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,269
I'll double your salary and assist
your family in any way I can.

1266
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,875
And Tim? Tim will walk again.

1267
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:48,197
And grow stronger and stronger.
Upon my life, he will.

1268
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,550
We'll discuss the particulars
this afternoon over a Christmas bowl.

1269
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,512
What is the matter with you?

1270
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,878
Nothing, sir.

1271
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,472
Well, it's just that...

1272
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:05,679
Nothing.

1273
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,479
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, my good fellow.

1274
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:14,070
Make up the fire
before we freeze to death.

1275
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,594
Buy some more coal...

1276
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,870
...before you dot another "I"!

1277
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,708
Yes, sir.

1278
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,518
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge
was better than his word.</i>

1279
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,991
<i>He became as good a friend,
as good a master...</i>

1280
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,277
<i>...as good a man
as the old city knew.</i>

1281
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,475
<i>And to Tiny Tim, who did not die,
he was a second father.</i>

1282
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,468
<i>It was said of Ebenezer Scrooge
that he kept Christmas well.</i>

1283
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,280
<i>If any man alive
possessed the knowledge...</i>

1284
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,876
<i>...may that be truly said of us,
and all of us.</i>

1285
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,116
<i>And so as Tiny Tim observed:</i>

1286
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,875
<i>"God bless us, everyone!"</i>

1287
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,869
