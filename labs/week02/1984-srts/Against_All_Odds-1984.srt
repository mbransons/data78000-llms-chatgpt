00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,629
<i>Se単or.</i>

2
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,468
- Have you seen this woman?
<i>- No, se単or</i>.

3
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,303
<i>Gracias.</i>

4
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,213
<i>Gracias.</i>

5
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,014
<i>No.</i>

6
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:47,517
No?

7
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:49,185
No?

8
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,590
<i>Se単or. Se単or.</i>

9
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,178
<i>Gracias.</i>

10
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:15,938
<i>Ten, 42, 36, hut, hut, hut!</i>

11
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,072
Way to go, Brogan!

12
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:27,784
The old man
can still catch, huh?

13
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,371
Take care of that shoulder.
Good job.

14
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,624
Nice snatch, for an old man,
but watch this one.

15
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,334
Brogan!

16
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,301
I didn't like what I saw on Sunday.

17
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,138
What? I caught
the winning touchdown.

18
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,849
You missed that track-back block
on Cooper's run.

19
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,602
You were worried
about your shoulder.

20
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,313
What's that gotta do with the operation.
There's no permanent damage.

21
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,983
I don't want any weaknesses
that can be read by the other team.

22
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,653
You took yourself off
the injured reserve.

23
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,363
You said you were healthy.

24
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:07,490
The shoulder is solid.

25
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,325
Why don't you
prove that to me.

26
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,493
I intend to.

27
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:11,911
I mean right now.

28
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,747
Mrs. Wyler's paying you
a lot of money

29
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,166
to play football, not talk about it.

30
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,710
Why don't you go over to the sled
and impress me.

31
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,838
The sled is bullshit.

32
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,091
I got two rookies who need
playing time, Brogan.

33
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,052
Either go to the sled
or sit on the bench.

34
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:33,683
No, Stassen. I'll go over there
and prove it to you.

35
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,935
Sam! Go with him.

36
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,354
Yeah, come on, Sam.

37
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:42,358
No matter how long you play,
they want you to prove it one more time.

38
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:43,693
North field scrimmage.

39
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:46,571
That guy's been on my ass
since he got here.

40
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:56,038
Here we go.
All right, hand down.

41
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,748
Look at me. Ready.

42
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,709
Hit it!

43
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:05,882
Sam, get on it.

44
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,472
All right, hand down.
Look at me.

45
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,099
Hit it!

46
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,561
Argh! Fuck!

47
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,065
Sully! I'd like you to meet our
county supervisor, Ed Phillips.

48
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,318
He's Mrs. Wyler's guest today.

49
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,820
- Hi, Ed.
- I'm a big fan.

50
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,741
Not only of the Outlaws,
but of the kind of football you played.

51
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,994
Football's changed since
I was a player.

52
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:37,079
Right, right.

53
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,248
I guess that run
of injuries

54
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,417
kind of hurt you guys
last season.

55
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,586
Yeah. We had a lousy bench
last year.

56
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:46,589
We had to play a lot of injured ball players
that shouldn't have been playing.

57
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,591
That's part of the job.

58
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,593
You telling us
you never played injured?

59
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,303
Yeah, well, I was dumb.

60
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:55,139
I don't like my boys
getting hurt permanently.

61
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,517
- That's why they call him "Mother".
<i>- Hit it!</i>

62
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,938
I don't know about
being a supervisor.

63
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,815
I sure as hell don't know
about being a lawyer.

64
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,737
But if I was a lawyer I wouldn't know
shit about football, would I?

65
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,280
Excuse me.

66
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,951
Let's get out of here.

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,203
- Hit it!
- Ugh!

68
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:20,957
You don't have to do this, Brogan.

69
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,625
The fucker's not beating me.

70
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:27,129
Hand down again. Look at me!

71
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,423
- Hit it!
- Ugh!

72
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,636
I'm the trainer here,
and I say he's had enough.

73
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,137
Hey, come on, Brogan.

74
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,807
What are you trying to prove?
You're a veteran!

75
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,893
What a dumb fucking thing
to have me do!

76
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,021
Wait for me in my office, Brogan.

77
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,499
Steve Kirsch's office.

78
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,003
This is Terry Brogan.
I need to speak to Steve.

79
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,883
Yeah, the Outlaws
just put me on waivers.

80
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,844
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,179
I'm a big fan of yours, Terry.

82
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,224
Hold, please.
It's Terry Brogan. He's been cut.

83
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,852
- Tell him to call Schumacher.
- He needs to talk to you.

84
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,687
I don't handle players anymore.

85
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:26,355
- Steve.
- Get rid of him.

86
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:35,364
Hello again. Mr. Kirsch can't talk right now,
but he suggests you call Hal Schumacher.

87
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,701
I don't want Hal Schumacher,
I wanna speak to Steve.

88
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,077
When's he available?

89
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:42,121
I really don't know.

90
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,375
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

91
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,635
- They hurt my shoulder, then cut me.
- Shit!

92
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,596
That's it in a word.

93
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,681
They promised me
they'd keep you.

94
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:02,558
This is behind my back, kid.

95
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,351
Yeah, I figured.

96
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,730
At first I thought
they'd pay me off.

97
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:09,440
But fuck,
I want to play football.

98
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,734
Not this year.
Not with that shoulder.

99
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,569
Let me ask you something.

100
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,113
What makes you think
they'll pay you off?

101
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,282
I was injured.

102
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:22,411
You played two games great.
If you were injured, you didn't look it.

103
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,246
What was I supposed to do, huh?

104
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:27,249
I could smell what they were thinking.
I give them any trouble, they cut me.

105
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,085
They cut you anyway.

106
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,379
They're rebuilding.
More profit, less talent.

107
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,923
You cost too much,
my friend.

108
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,634
They're not screwing me around.

109
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,594
I'm gonna see my lawyer.

110
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,807
I'll miss the pressure, Hank.

111
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:51,440
Give me a call.

112
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,283
Caxton, Benjamin,
Parker and Stein.

113
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:04,453
Yes, he is. Hold on a moment.
Hello. May I help you?

114
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,373
- Yeah. I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.
- I'll ring his office.

115
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,833
Please have a seat.

116
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,459
Hello.

117
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,002
Hi.

118
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,796
I'm here to see Steve Kirsch.

119
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:17,466
I know.
I'm the one you've been talking to all day.

120
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,260
The one who's a big fan.

121
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,804
- Oh, right. What's your name?
- Edie.

122
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,431
Edie, I guess he's not ever
going to talk to me?

123
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,143
Oh, you're down
in my book to call.

124
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,229
- Where's his office?
- He's not here.

125
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,816
I know you gotta keep
your job, Edie.

126
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,317
You have a nice face. I...

127
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,319
I'm telling you the truth.

128
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:41,490
It wouldn't be out of line
for you to lie, would it?

129
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:43,993
No.

130
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:46,328
Where is he?

131
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:58,424
- Terry. It's good to see you.
- I've been cut from the Outlaws.

132
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,344
Yeah, I know, I heard.
The firm represents Mrs. Wyler.

133
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,517
Since I joined the firm,
I can't represent players.

134
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,729
Mrs. Wyler owns the Outlaws.
She's our biggest client.

135
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,731
It's a conflict of interest.

136
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:17,610
Wait a minute. Listen, Steve.
When you came hustling me in school,

137
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,529
I put my career in your hands.
Remember those times, please.

138
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:23,574
You're right, I'm sorry.
Sit down.

139
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,659
Now,

140
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,288
I've been playing injured.

141
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:32,291
They know that and they don't wanna admit it
because they don't want to pay me off.

142
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:35,586
Yup. I think that's what their
position's gonna be.

143
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,213
Their position's fucked.

144
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,381
I'll go to the Players' Association.
They'll back me.

145
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,009
You could do that, but listen.

146
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:46,138
What happens if the Outlaws prove
that you're perfectly fine?

147
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,642
They've got film on you
at practice, preseason games.

148
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:53,646
They're gonna fight for
a long, long time.

149
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:58,442
Steve, look.

150
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,612
I'm having money problems, man.

151
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,572
I'm broke.

152
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,409
Terry. Did you spend
every single cent you ever made?

153
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:14,750
Let me think for just a second here.

154
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:22,383
I should get you a low-interest loan
to tide you over in the meantime.

155
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,426
- Excuse me...
- Could you just wait for a second, please?

156
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:30,432
And then I'll talk to these guys,
see if I can soften their position

157
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,519
and get you something
so it's not such a big hassle for you.

158
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,020
Yeah?

159
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,147
Excuse me, Mr. Kirsch.
The reception?

160
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,565
Mr. Caxton's waiting.

161
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,985
Oh, right, I forgot. I gotta go.

162
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,029
Look, I gotta know something
about this soon, Steve.

163
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,948
I'll get on it first thing.

164
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,659
Hey, you're one of
my first players, huh?

165
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,295
Mike Hogan and his wife, Susan.
Ben Cassidy.

166
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:00,713
Thank you for coming.

167
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,472
Here's Hal Schumacher's number.

168
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:13,225
Call him. He's a nice man.

169
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,228
Do they always get bombed
at the end of the day?

170
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,857
It's business down there.
It's an intimate fundraiser.

171
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,066
What do you mean?

172
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,485
Mr. Caxton has assessed
every lawyer in the firm

173
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:28,157
$1500 to contribute to the
reelection of Councilman Weinberg.

174
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:32,119
Mrs. Wyler is Caxton's
biggest client, isn't she?

175
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,247
Yes. In fact, he's doing
business for her right now.

176
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,915
Yeah? For the Outlaws?

177
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,419
No. Mrs. Wyler's real business
is real estate.

178
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,839
Caxton wants a zoning variance
on Mrs. Wyler's canyon

179
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,008
so she can build houses there.

180
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,136
His guest of honor tonight
could vote against it.

181
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,555
Trust me, he won't now.

182
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,065
I hate things like before,
when I couldn't be straight with you.

183
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,153
I'm running out
of conversation.

184
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,864
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

185
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:11,200
I'd like to have a drink
with you.

186
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,868
The Ginger Man, after work?

187
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,162
Okay, sure.
The Ginger Man.

188
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,976
Touchdown.

189
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,773
What are you doing here?
You been cut.

190
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:46,318
- They can get you for trespassing.
- I'd outrun them.

191
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,946
Why are you here, Tommy?

192
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:50,781
Jake wants to see you.

193
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,826
How is Jake?

194
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,786
He got stabbed last week.

195
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,496
What a shame.

196
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,707
He survived, Brogan.

197
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:05,629
Why does he want me?

198
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:09,091
- He might have a job for you.
- Heh, heh.

199
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,427
You tell him "No, thanks".

200
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,345
He'll be at the beach tomorrow.

201
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,931
There's a volleyball game.

202
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,474
Yeah? Is he playing?

203
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:20,936
I told you, he got stabbed, man.

204
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,106
Well, he lived, right?

205
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,944
You got problems now, Terry.

206
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:30,446
You want trouble too?

207
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,495
Come to the beach tomorrow.

208
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,330
You're not dumb.

209
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,249
Besides,

210
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,960
what the hell else
you got to do?

211
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,809
Sam!

212
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:03,896
Sam!

213
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,483
Sam! Come here!

214
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,360
Hey, you look good as a cripple.

215
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,823
Is that why I had to come here, after two years,
to give you my opinion on that?

216
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:18,160
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- Lousy.

217
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,828
How's your life?

218
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,664
The club? The Palace is doing great.

219
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:26,835
The other business is even better.
My action's about half a million dollars a week.

220
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:31,507
You know the grand prize today for the two
guys who win this thing? Thirty grand.

221
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:34,176
It's not bad, is it?
A few hours running on the beach.

222
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,679
Don't tell me you're taking
action on this game?

223
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:42,017
You think these are beach rats
running around here? Huh?

224
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,520
These guys
are world-class players.

225
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,355
You didn't know that?

226
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,690
Sam! Sam, come here!

227
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:53,695
People love to bet on sports.
You know that. I just help them out.

228
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:54,905
Yeah, right.

229
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:58,033
South Bay guys love this fucking game,
and they got money to burn.

230
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,535
I'll take their action.

231
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,538
Hey, who's the fuzzy face?
Do you want a cookie?

232
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,540
There's one! Whoa!

233
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,458
You fuzzy face, come on!

234
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,336
What kind of dog is gonna
hang out with you, Jake?

235
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,213
He doesn't belong to me.

236
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,382
He belongs to the lady
who cut me.

237
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,468
You're into
violent women now, hm?

238
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,762
Look, I was a bit of an asshole.

239
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:22,724
I got crazy and popped her a few times.
She came after me with a knife.

240
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,393
Just missed my balls.

241
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,562
And was she going for them?

242
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,146
Don't they all?

243
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:33,110
- You got a new Porsche, huh?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,445
What the fuck,
you're rich, right?

245
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:38,949
Let's talk it over at the Palace.
What do you say?

246
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,578
We'll get there like the old days.
You up to it?

247
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,121
No.

248
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,872
Come on, Sam. Come on!

249
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,583
Come on, get in the car.

250
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,626
I'll just meet you there.

251
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,129
You getting afraid of me
in your old age?

252
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,422
Yeah, right.

253
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,965
Come on.

254
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,302
Be a good release. You don't need
to release a little tension?

255
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,430
Do I have to tie one leg
behind my back?

256
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,973
Take the old route.

257
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,266
Sunset.

258
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,033
Let's see if you still got balls!

259
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,435
- How'd you like that?
- All good!

260
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,705
Where were you?

261
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,172
That was smart. Ha, ha.

262
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,507
See you!

263
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,366
Shit.

264
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,243
You're still number two!

265
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,203
Dream on, Terry!

266
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,539
Jake!

267
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,542
Son of a bitch!

268
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,549
Shit.

269
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,596
What a fucking idiot!

270
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,223
Scared the shit out of you, huh?

271
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:09,599
No!

272
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,936
I'm an asshole for racing with you!
I'm pulling out!

273
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,564
Come on, don't pussy out
on me now!

274
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:22,279
The fun's over, Jake!

275
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,823
Not yet!

276
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:03,820
- Hey. Sam, be quiet!
- Get over here.

277
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:06,948
What kept you?
I was getting worried.

278
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:10,452
I was afraid you flew out of your
car got stuck in all that garbage.

279
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,163
Can't have a fair race
with a goddamn maniac.

280
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:15,457
Here, maybe this
will fix you up.

281
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,833
Come here.

282
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,794
Have a taste of this.

283
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,632
How about a Guinness?

284
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,634
Wanna tell me what
I'm doing here?

285
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,677
You're out of a job, right?

286
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,305
I've got some
job possibilities for you.

287
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:33,141
For one, you can work
right back here.

288
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:34,684
Celebrity bartender.

289
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:38,396
Making drinks and telling your football
stories to drunks every night.

290
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:39,856
How does that sound?

291
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:43,151
You take the job.
You're a lot funnier than I am.

292
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,111
How about security guard?

293
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,197
I mean,
you know how to get hit.

294
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,700
The point is, for a guy
in your situation, Terry,

295
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,994
the options stink.

296
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,541
Or you can find her for me.

297
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,169
Who's this, the knife lady?

298
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,839
She's very important to me, Terry.

299
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,383
I think about her
the whole fucking time.

300
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,218
Hey, that's a new reality for you.

301
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:12,013
She stole 50 grand from me.
I would've given her the money.

302
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,431
I want her back.

303
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,058
And I want you to find her.

304
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:19,271
You're crazy. Why would you
trust me with her anyway?

305
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,524
Jessie hates football players.

306
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,276
You think that's funny?

307
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:29,072
She's also Mrs. Wyler's daughter.
Did you ever meet her?

308
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,699
Jake.

309
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,743
I've heard about her.
She's supposed to be pretty wild.

310
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,788
Her father was this English guy
Mrs. Wyler use to be married to.

311
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,750
One of those London stage actors who comes
over here, can't make it in American films.

312
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,296
Anyway, after he died,
Mr. Wyler adopted her.

313
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:47,382
An owner's daughter,
living with a bookie.

314
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,217
That's something, isn't it?

315
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,263
She hates her mother. The woman treated
her like a possession all her life.

316
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,561
You know what it feels like to be one of
Mrs. Wyler's possessions, don't you?

317
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,483
I'll give you $10,000 right now.

318
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,485
Pay your expenses.

319
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:11,615
And if you find her,
I'll give you 20,000 more.

320
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:16,912
You're crazy.
I'm a football player.

321
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:18,747
Without a team.

322
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:22,250
Hey, that new Porsche
of yours, is it paid for?

323
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,130
What are you gonna do, man?
Sell insurance? I mean, that's it.

324
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,217
You don't have the personality
to work for one of the networks.

325
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,761
Look, Terry.

326
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,096
I don't want you to bring
her back, man.

327
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,933
Just find her. Tell me where she is.

328
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:41,436
What does that take?
Time and money.

329
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:44,773
You got the time right now.
I got the money.

330
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:46,608
Oh, great.

331
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:49,319
You know, I've never used
what I got on you.

332
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:52,113
Could be otherwise.

333
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,868
I wouldn't want that. Would you?

334
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,454
It's simple.

335
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:02,457
Either you want to play
football again or you don't.

336
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,376
You never change, do you?

337
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:07,045
Not a bit.

338
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,840
Try Mrs. Wyler. She's probably
got an idea where Jessie is.

339
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,342
Right.

340
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:20,308
If this is about you being cut,

341
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:23,853
I don't involve myself with
the day-to-day business of the team.

342
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,981
That's not why I came here,
Mrs. Wyler.

343
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,440
Oh?

344
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,320
Then suppose you tell me exactly
what you want with me, Mr. Brogan.

345
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,864
I'm looking for your daughter.

346
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,995
We were very close,
and she disappeared all of a sudden.

347
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:44,833
- Give me a break.
- What do you mean?

348
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,710
He sent you.

349
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,005
Who?

350
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,881
Jake...

351
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,341
Wise.

352
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,094
She was only with him to spite me.

353
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,056
I don't know what she did
to get away from him.

354
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:03,393
What matters is,
she got the hell away from him.

355
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,020
Why don't you drink to that?

356
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:07,355
Grace?

357
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:11,192
Hi.

358
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:15,697
Well, Ed seems to have solved
the Soames problem.

359
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:18,366
The head of the planning commission
is coming to your party Saturday.

360
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:21,703
We're finally softening up
these environmentalists.

361
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,371
How wonderful.

362
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:26,875
You seem to have won
the opposition over on your own.

363
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,544
A good project sells itself.

364
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:32,338
MOBSO's got lots of other
mountains to save.

365
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,593
- You know Terry Brogan.
- How are you?

366
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,428
Okay.

367
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:41,347
- And Supervisor Phillips.
- I'm a big fan.

368
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:43,058
Thanks.

369
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,353
Ed, I wonder if you'd mind going ahead
to the table. We'll be right along.

370
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:49,397
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

371
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,983
- Be with you in a minute.
- See you then.

372
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:55,236
Well, Ben,

373
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:58,114
it seems Mr. Brogan
has a new job.

374
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,743
Working for Jake Wise.

375
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:03,661
Looking for Jessica.

376
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,246
Oh.

377
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,665
You and Wise good friends?

378
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:11,753
I go to his club for the music.
So do a lot of the team.

379
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,588
Uh-huh.

380
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:16,591
Why don't you let us
steal you away from him.

381
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:19,260
I won't let Jessica live like this.

382
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,596
I'll double whatever he's paying you.

383
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:24,099
I'm not some gun for hire.

384
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,935
He can't top what we can offer,
can he, Ben?

385
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,815
He can't give you your job back
with the Outlaws.

386
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:39,531
Well, we could consider something.

387
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:43,952
You know, it isn't easy for
Jessica to hide from me.

388
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,454
She's been drawing from her trust.

389
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:50,959
It's going to a little bank in Mexico.
To an island.

390
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:53,128
Cozumel.

391
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:56,673
You could keep a watch on her.

392
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,968
Make sure he gets nowhere
near her again. Hmm?

393
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,347
You know, uh...

394
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:09,310
I think I used Jake Wise
as an excuse to come here.

395
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,354
I guess I did come here
to get my job back.

396
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,526
I didn't deserve what I got.
I played some damn good ball for you.

397
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:19,154
I got a lot of good years left.

398
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:23,658
Of course I want to be back on the
team, but because I'm worth it.

399
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:27,871
Not because I spied on some
25-year-old who ran away from home.

400
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,666
I'm not going to spy for you
or Jake Wise.

401
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,836
Ben, this young man
is trespassing here.

402
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:36,671
Throw him out.

403
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,055
I don't believe you're wanted here.

404
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,185
And you can forget about Kirsch.
He's on my team.

405
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:54,856
You want the Outlaws
to pay you off? Sue us.

406
00:27:55,024 --> 00:27:56,524
Walk him to his car.

407
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,194
I can kick myself out, thanks.

408
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,095
Ten years' work, Grace.

409
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,848
And we're this close.

410
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:35,271
I think just a few members of the
team would have been enough.

411
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:39,067
Having the Outlaws out here,
full force, is kind of crowding it.

412
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:43,029
I have to get some use out of them.
I don't like football.

413
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:46,616
Ben!

414
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,826
Ben!

415
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,161
We got troubles.

416
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,081
Soames is here.

417
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,334
He's brought a lot of those
'Save the Mountain' people with him.

418
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,544
It doesn't look good.

419
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,089
Goddamn environmentalist
bastards.

420
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:05,802
I think you'd better handle this.
Come on, Ed.

421
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:08,680
I can't believe
he's doing this to us, Ben.

422
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:10,807
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Wyler.
- Hello.

423
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:13,434
I'm Bob Soames.
I'm on the County Planning Commission.

424
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,353
- But then you know that.
- Of course I do.

425
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:16,980
It's a pleasure to meet you.

426
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:18,690
It's been a long time coming.

427
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,150
I've brought a few of my friends.
I hope you don't mind.

428
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,069
Not at all.

429
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,947
Bob, are your friends
from the Sierra Club?

430
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,449
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Quite a few of them.

431
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:29,951
I hope they're welcome here.

432
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,619
I've supported them for years.

433
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,496
Not only financially, of course,

434
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,291
but also in my heart.

435
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,126
Please join us for refreshments.

436
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:41,462
- Oh, no, no. I really don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

437
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,298
Please.

438
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:47,343
All right.

439
00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:49,304
Thank you.

440
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:52,473
I'm sorry, Ben.
He promised me.

441
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,601
Soames thinks he's a smart-ass.

442
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm not laughing.

443
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,147
Cute little stores
on the bottom.

444
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,650
"Zoning variances don't count."
I say, "Come on..."

445
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,986
What's it been,
three weeks?

446
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,655
Could you excuse me
for just a second?

447
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:10,658
What are you doing here?

448
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:11,826
Free eats, right?

449
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,872
Right. It's Mrs. Wyler's party.
You don't wanna be here.

450
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,375
That was total bullshit
in your office, wasn't it?

451
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,502
You don't care about me.

452
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:23,713
You work for Caxton.

453
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,883
You wanted to play
pro football, right?

454
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:31,220
Every year, there's a 25 percent chance
you'd lose your job because of injury.

455
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:34,766
You players never grasp,
it is not a very secure job.

456
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,060
A lot of us made you rich,
didn't we?

457
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:41,230
That's right, Brogan. I got rich.

458
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,358
I'm getting still richer all the time.

459
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,568
That's good, Steve.

460
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:49,364
- Come on, come on.
- God.

461
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,700
You can afford it
when I kick your teeth in!

462
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:55,036
Do it, see what happens!
You're a has-been!

463
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,165
Cool it, man.
Come on, goddamn it!

464
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:01,876
That's intelligent.

465
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:05,380
- Will you cool it?
- You know Caxton's here.

466
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,673
Hey, come on.

467
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:08,883
Relax.

468
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,302
You're finished in football!

469
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,096
- Get him out!
- I'm out of here!

470
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,224
- You're not playing this right.
- I could give a fuck.

471
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:18,851
Mr. Wyler never mixed his
other businesses with the team.

472
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,229
We played football.
We didn't sell real estate.

473
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,606
You're saying I'm lucky
to be off the team?

474
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,650
It's a new goddamn ball game.

475
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,569
That's all I'm telling you.
It's all bullshit!

476
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,572
I don't belong here either.
It's a goddamn circus!

477
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:34,909
- I'm hearing weird things about you.
- Heh, heh. Like what?

478
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,370
Like you might be going
to work for Jake Wise.

479
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:38,621
He offered me a job.

480
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:42,333
But you turned him down.
You're a smart kid. Wait.

481
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,087
You're worried about money,
but don't screw around with Wise.

482
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,506
I'll make a call.
I'm gonna get you a coaching job.

483
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:49,924
Just for the year.

484
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:52,593
I'm not ready to do what you do.
I'm a player!

485
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:55,138
There's nothing here
for me now but shit!

486
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:58,224
They won't pay me my money.
My shoulder's screwed up.

487
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,768
Know what
I'm telling myself to do?

488
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,646
Take Wise's money.
Take a damn vacation!

489
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,941
I'll find his rich girl for him
and lay in the sun.

490
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,026
Have a good season, Hank.

491
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:11,988
- Terry!
- I'm on my own.

492
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,657
Keep away from Wise, damn it!

493
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,095
Thank you.

494
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:25,353
Jessie?

495
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,192
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,528
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,223
<i>No.</i>

498
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,827
Jessie?

499
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,167
You're Jessie Wyler, aren't you?

500
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:13,461
I'm Terry Brogan.

501
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,130
I played ball for the Outlaws.

502
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:17,798
The Outlaws don't interest me.

503
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,510
I'm not playing this season.

504
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,512
<i>Gracias.</i>

505
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:27,642
Say, there's not much going on here.
Where can I go to have a good time?

506
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:30,144
Get off the island.
The ferry leaves every morning.

507
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,983
- Can I buy you a drink or something?
- Nope.

508
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,568
How about a taco, huh?

509
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:46,535
I guess you can have anybody
do that for you in L.A., huh?

510
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,371
- What's that?
- Have some football player

511
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,956
buy you a couple tacos
and a beer.

512
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:56,337
There are a lot better things to do.
Even in L.A.

513
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,509
What is it you don't like exactly?
Football players,

514
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:03,678
tacos or beer?

515
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:06,681
I like tacos and I like beer.

516
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:08,307
Hey!

517
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:13,020
I should take the ferry, huh?

518
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,191
I figure if I keep talking,
you won't disappear.

519
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:21,570
Bye.

520
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,030
You sure about that?

521
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:26,992
Hey!

522
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,983
Yeah?

523
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:02,445
Hey, Jake. How's it going?

524
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,573
No, nothing yet.

525
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:07,158
No.

526
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,663
Hey, I didn't expect to have signs
telling me where she is, you know?

527
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,752
I don't know.
Maybe I'll be outside having a drink,

528
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:21,839
I'll look over and, out of nowhere,
she'll be buying some fruit or something.

529
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,091
I'll call you in a few days.

530
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:29,346
All right. See you. Bye.

531
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,771
Hey, pretty slick, Roberto.

532
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,940
Okay, <i>se単or. Cerveza</i>, no glass.

533
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:42,818
<i>Gracias</i>. I've been hanging
out here a lot, huh?

534
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,987
<i>S鱈.</i>

535
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,782
Some hangout.

536
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,145
Damn it!

537
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:30,658
- Where's that boat going?
- Tulum.

538
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,868
- When's the next ferry?
- Six hours.

539
00:38:33,036 --> 00:38:34,078
Shit!

540
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,102
Should I be afraid of you?

541
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,689
I don't know.

542
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,236
It's beautiful, huh?

543
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,406
If this were L.A., my stepfather
would've bought it.

544
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:55,117
Torn it up and built condominiums.

545
00:39:56,244 --> 00:40:00,122
Here, the land intimidates them.
They leave it in peace, thank God.

546
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:02,249
Some spot.

547
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:06,629
It's nothing like the great
Maya cities of the Yucat叩n.

548
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:08,088
Chich辿n Itz叩.

549
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:10,257
Should have hidden there.

550
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:12,635
Is that what you're doing? Hiding?

551
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:14,511
Yep.

552
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,309
From you, right?

553
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,437
What do you mean?

554
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,232
Jake sent you.

555
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,280
Maybe your mother did.

556
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,242
Hey, I wouldn't know which one
had more to threaten you with.

557
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:41,789
You wanna know the truth?

558
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:43,374
I came for the hell of it.

559
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:48,671
I wanted to get out of L.A. An island
in the Caribbean didn't sound too bad.

560
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,466
Only trouble is,
now I'm here I find myself

561
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:55,636
in the middle of something
I have absolutely no feeling for.

562
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:59,306
Well, you're not doing this for free.

563
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,059
You're getting paid well, aren't you?

564
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:06,271
Which one are you
working for?

565
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,274
Which one knows you found me?

566
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:11,777
Nobody knows anything, okay?

567
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:13,153
Oh, sure!

568
00:41:13,363 --> 00:41:14,738
I figure, fuck them. You know?

569
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:18,909
Fuck you too, lady.

570
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:23,163
I loved your drawing.

571
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,037
Yeah?

572
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,208
I wanna talk to you.

573
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:11,211
Talk.

574
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:15,049
Why should I believe
you won't tell Jake where I am?

575
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,887
Hey, look, there are probably people who care
what you believe. I don't see them in the room.

576
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:28,062
I have a broken shoulder,
both my knees are shot,

577
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,897
there are guys
crippling themselves now

578
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:33,776
so you can act like a 13-year-old
runaway from some mansion in Bel Air.

579
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:36,070
I could really give a shit
what you believe.

580
00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:45,079
- How's Sam?
- Who?

581
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,580
My dog.

582
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:49,083
I don't know.
Looks like he's being fed.

583
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:54,922
I think you were right.
I shouldn't be afraid of you.

584
00:42:57,926 --> 00:42:58,967
When you leaving?

585
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:03,597
I think 4:00.
I wish it were sooner.

586
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,018
Never found where I live, did you?

587
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,816
I don't think anybody could.

588
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,944
It's the prettiest place on the island.

589
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:20,280
Don't leave without saying goodbye.

590
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:27,287
<i>You take the highway out of town
to kilometer 19.</i>

591
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,706
<i>When you see
the three Tecate cans,</i>

592
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,793
<i>it's the first dirt road on the right.</i>

593
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:42,177
<i>Don't leave without
saying goodbye.</i>

594
00:43:45,306 --> 00:43:47,432
<i>Don't leave without
saying goodbye.</i>

595
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,827
You don't have to worry about
the neighbors.

596
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:10,164
They were building homes here
when a storm hit.

597
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:12,666
They all fell down except this one.

598
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:16,545
- Waited for you, huh?
- Yeah.

599
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,591
Like a drink?

600
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:22,676
All right.
That'd be great.

601
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:33,520
Tequila okay?
That's great, yeah.

602
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:37,191
It's Maya.

603
00:44:37,734 --> 00:44:39,610
Third century, I think.

604
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:48,285
- No ice.
- That's all right.

605
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,038
You don't have
any electricity here, huh?

606
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:52,956
No.

607
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:54,750
Propane.

608
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,052
So how'd you end up
with Jake?

609
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:07,512
The Palace, I guess.

610
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:12,893
I wanted to be a rock 'n' roll singer.

611
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:18,315
Jake convinced me that rich girls
don't have the soul for it.

612
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:23,070
Sounds like Jake. Always convincing
somebody of something.

613
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,283
It seems I have the soul to
live with him, be his girlfriend.

614
00:45:28,618 --> 00:45:31,078
Well, he never had anybody
like you before, I can tell you that.

615
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:39,169
You're a whole different class
for him.

616
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,130
Not really.

617
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:46,093
My family didn't get to own most
of Bel Air by being honest.

618
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,971
Jake always thought
I was his luck.

619
00:45:49,264 --> 00:45:51,598
I helped him outthink people
like my family.

620
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,060
I know why he wanted you.

621
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,937
But why were you with him?

622
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:02,109
I liked that my being with him
made a lot of people crazy.

623
00:46:03,778 --> 00:46:05,445
Like your mom?

624
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:08,949
It even frightened her.

625
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:12,327
And that was really something
to finally pull off.

626
00:46:14,831 --> 00:46:18,625
If only my brother had done that
and not by killing himself.

627
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,089
Your brother killed himself?

628
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:26,300
I guess.

629
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:31,972
He got into drugs
for the same reason I did.

630
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:34,850
To get away from our terrible life.

631
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:37,978
Did his dying make you stop?

632
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:40,897
No.

633
00:46:42,984 --> 00:46:44,151
Jake did.

634
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:45,819
Jake did?

635
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:52,367
After I was with him awhile, it became
very important to him that I stop.

636
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:55,162
Wouldn't leave me alone.
Kept after me until I quit.

637
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,998
The truth is I wanted to quit.

638
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,712
When I did,
I didn't need Jake anymore.

639
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,340
Bet that kind of threw him, huh?

640
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:14,723
He said the only way I could
get away from him was to kill him.

641
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:18,685
Well, you almost did.

642
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:23,023
Not really.

643
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,777
I'm gonna stay away from Jake.

644
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,029
And my mother.

645
00:47:30,198 --> 00:47:31,782
Good.

646
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,541
I ought to get going.

647
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:45,962
Why?

648
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,218
What'd you come here for?

649
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:42,496
You know, this is the best
I've felt in years.

650
00:49:42,705 --> 00:49:45,165
I think you're incredible.

651
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:47,167
You do?

652
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:50,587
Yes, I do.

653
00:50:05,228 --> 00:50:08,396
There's a great canyon down there.
Let's go back down there.

654
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:10,106
Don't you ever have
to breathe?

655
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,192
Come on, it's good therapy
for my shoulder.

656
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:30,710
This is a dream, you know that?

657
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:34,256
It's true! I've completely
forgotten about football.

658
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,549
- You liar!
- Hey!

659
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:38,218
That's the first thing
you've said I don't believe.

660
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:41,137
Hey, come here! It's true!

661
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:42,889
Then come in here
and prove it!

662
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:44,558
I'm not coming in there!

663
00:50:46,561 --> 00:50:48,520
Whoo!

664
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:53,275
Come on, <i>guapo</i>.
It's good therapy for your shoulder.

665
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,406
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

666
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,200
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

667
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:08,081
You know, I thought Jake would
send someone awful.

668
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:12,085
- How do you know I'm not awful?
- Maybe I'm no different than Jake.

669
00:51:16,257 --> 00:51:19,926
We haven't left each other's side
for the last two weeks.

670
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,599
I figure I know who you are,
Terry Brogan.

671
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:35,191
- Jess.
- Hmm?

672
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,653
You know...

673
00:51:40,948 --> 00:51:42,532
when I got my pro contract,

674
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,702
it was the first real money
I ever had.

675
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:48,455
It wasn't much because my lawyer
took a big hunk out of it.

676
00:51:48,664 --> 00:51:51,207
But still,
I bought everything in sight.

677
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:55,295
And the girl that I was
living with at the time,

678
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:59,174
she moved out on me when I was on the road.
Took all my furniture with her.

679
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:05,055
It seems funny now,
but at the time it flipped me out.

680
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:10,435
I was under a lot of pressure,
trying to make the starting lineup.

681
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:15,523
I started acting crazy,
hanging out with Jake.

682
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:19,569
We got along great.
He was as crazy as I was.

683
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:25,325
And after a couple of years,
I got my ass into debt.

684
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,952
I mean, really badly.

685
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:32,540
And I made a deal with him
to shave points.

686
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,967
You know, you don't have to
tell me this, okay?

687
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:45,679
I'm supposed to stop now,
or something?

688
00:52:45,971 --> 00:52:49,391
You said you know me.
Well, you don't. I want you to.

689
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:58,608
It was a game during the playoffs.

690
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,903
We were expected to win
by a four-point spread.

691
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:06,741
I was supposed to see
we didn't win by so fucking much.

692
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:10,537
I kept putting off doing anything about
it because I was feeling so good.

693
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:12,997
You know,
blow the other team out.

694
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:18,420
In the fourth quarter, they scored
14 points. Everything was great.

695
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,714
The point spread was four.
We were ahead by three.

696
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:22,757
I didn't have to do anything.

697
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:26,136
Then the quarterback,

698
00:53:26,387 --> 00:53:28,596
he threw this pass.

699
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:31,808
Put it right into my hands.

700
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,645
It was just so perfect I just
had to catch it, you know.

701
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:41,109
All I had to do was just
drop the fucker.

702
00:53:41,402 --> 00:53:44,446
But my reflexes took over.

703
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:50,285
So their guy tackled me
on the five...

704
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:53,413
and I fumbled. I, uh...

705
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:58,793
I just made my hands
let go of the ball.

706
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:07,427
It scared the shit out of me.

707
00:54:07,595 --> 00:54:10,555
I thought everybody
in the stadium, all 55,000,

708
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:13,057
knew I was a son of a bitch.

709
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:19,439
So you won by three instead
of four points.

710
00:54:19,648 --> 00:54:23,067
Jess, if another player
would have done that,

711
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:26,154
you'd have to pull me off of him quick,
or he'd be dead.

712
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,452
It's still torturing you, isn't it?

713
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:36,998
See, I do know who you are.

714
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,130
Do you know what I wish?

715
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:52,013
I wish I'd seen you play football.

716
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:56,643
I bet you were wonderful.

717
00:54:58,312 --> 00:54:59,979
God.

718
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:04,734
I can see how Jake would
go crazy without you.

719
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:18,623
God, Jess.

720
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,532
All from Jake.

721
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,704
They stopped coming in
four days ago.

722
00:55:58,873 --> 00:56:00,874
We should leave here, you know.

723
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,794
Oh, Terry, I don't want to leave.

724
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,714
It's so perfect here.

725
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:09,799
Yeah, I know.

726
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,885
We have no choice, though.

727
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,556
Well, I don't have
much money left.

728
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:19,183
Can't draw from my trust
for another three months.

729
00:56:21,437 --> 00:56:22,770
Jake's money's all gone?

730
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:27,317
What do you mean, Jake's money?

731
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,071
He said you took, uh,
50 grand from him.

732
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:34,324
Steal from him,
when I want him off me?

733
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:36,743
I'd be out of my mind.

734
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:43,791
I didn't take a cent
of his goddamn money.

735
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:52,342
Well, I've got the money
he gave me so...

736
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:55,595
Hey, I'll go to the hotel
in the morning and get my bags.

737
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,764
We'll cover our tracks, huh?

738
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:01,100
But you have to go to
Chich辿n Itz叩 alone, okay?

739
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:04,270
I gotta get Jake off our trail.

740
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,397
Okay.

741
00:57:40,975 --> 00:57:43,476
God, where have you been, Terry?

742
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:45,645
I've had 10 days
in this horrible place.

743
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,022
I found a guy to
get us a house in Oaxaca.

744
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:50,566
- Anywhere but here.
- I hope he's for real.

745
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:52,652
It'll cost all I've got.

746
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,780
- You don't know what it's like here.
- Where are we going?

747
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:03,079
- Come on, people can see us.
- If they can, who cares?

748
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,165
Jess, come on.
Will you cool it?

749
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:08,835
Come on,
you know we had to separate.

750
00:58:09,044 --> 00:58:11,838
Jake thinks I'm all over
the place looking for you.

751
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:14,465
I've been to Mexico City,
Cuernavaca, Taxco.

752
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,634
Jessie. Hey.

753
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:20,346
I wired Jake.
He thinks you're in Campeche.

754
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:42,452
I wonder, when was the last time
someone used this court?

755
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:46,622
Fourteen or 15 centuries ago,
maybe.

756
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:52,545
The games they had here must've
been incredible. Look at this.

757
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:56,090
They even wore facemasks,
had shoulder pads.

758
00:58:58,218 --> 00:59:01,637
Games were a little more serious
than the ones you play, Terry.

759
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:07,477
They'd play for days. The team that
lost got their heads chopped off.

760
00:59:08,896 --> 00:59:10,897
And the guys who bet
on the game,

761
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,566
wagered themselves,
even their children.

762
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:15,943
And if they lost, they were slaves.

763
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:19,572
You're going crazy here,
aren't you?

764
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,910
I think I'd be crazy if I weren't.

765
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:27,747
We're getting out.

766
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:29,415
To go where?

767
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,293
Another place
we don't belong?

768
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:34,587
We could do better.

769
00:59:37,382 --> 00:59:38,758
With what?

770
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,593
Jess.

771
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:44,889
I don't have the money Jake and
your mother have, but so what?

772
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,600
I'm taking care of you, aren't I?
Jess.

773
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:49,936
There's money
in Mexico City.

774
00:59:50,104 --> 00:59:52,522
- What do you mean? Whose money?
- Mine.

775
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:55,274
Yours?

776
00:59:56,443 --> 00:59:57,944
Jake's.

777
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:02,031
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I couldn't trust you for sure.

778
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,617
Since when
couldn't you trust me?

779
01:00:04,827 --> 01:00:06,786
- In the beginning.
- What beginning?

780
01:00:06,954 --> 01:00:08,996
We've been in this 10 minutes
after we saw each other.

781
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:12,125
Hey, tell me. When did you
start trusting me?

782
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:15,461
Terry, it was a risk
to trust you, all right?

783
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:17,964
That's funny.
I never thought of it that way.

784
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:21,134
I took the risk by letting
you come with me.

785
01:00:21,426 --> 01:00:22,677
You let me come with you?

786
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,471
Yeah. It would've been different
if I were alone.

787
01:00:26,348 --> 01:00:29,225
What, do you think I'm caging you in
or something?

788
01:00:29,476 --> 01:00:31,310
Well, it's true, isn't it?

789
01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:36,315
I'm standing in your way of freedom?
I'm keeping you from your money in Mexico City?

790
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:37,817
You're twisting what I say.

791
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,319
Hey, Jesus, I love you.

792
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:42,822
You've become everything I'm about!
Don't you understand?

793
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,741
Can't anyone love me
without it being

794
01:00:45,993 --> 01:00:48,035
life or death to them?

795
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,876
Most people are afraid they're
never going to be loved like that.

796
01:00:58,213 --> 01:00:59,672
Terry, wait!

797
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:07,013
I've lied and used people all my life because
I thought that's what everybody did.

798
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:10,558
Everyone except my brother,
and look where it got him.

799
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:16,189
It's just so hard for me
to trust anyone.

800
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:17,523
I'm not anyone.

801
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:19,901
I know.

802
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,695
I know you're not, and I'm trying.

803
01:01:22,905 --> 01:01:24,530
I want to trust you.

804
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,033
God, I love you.

805
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:30,369
I love you.

806
01:01:41,757 --> 01:01:44,091
Come on.
The park's closing.

807
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,428
Let's go to the sweathouse.

808
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,222
Okay.

809
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,166
Terry.

810
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:02,586
There's somebody in here.

811
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:05,089
- Where?
- There's somebody there.

812
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:11,554
Sully.

813
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:14,140
- What the fuck...-?
- Sorry I walked in on you like that.

814
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:15,599
Walked in on me?

815
01:03:16,977 --> 01:03:18,978
What the hell
are you doing here?

816
01:03:19,688 --> 01:03:21,314
What am I doing here?

817
01:03:21,523 --> 01:03:23,649
What are we doing here?

818
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:25,310
You're in a lot of trouble.

819
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:27,820
I came to talk some sense
into you, I guess.

820
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,655
You came here to talk to me?

821
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:32,992
Terry,

822
01:03:33,493 --> 01:03:35,745
if a tired old guy like me
can find you...

823
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:40,583
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

824
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:46,339
Who is he, Terry?

825
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:50,259
It's Hank Sully.
He's with the Outlaws.

826
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:52,928
Jake sent him.

827
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,640
That's crazy.

828
01:03:56,808 --> 01:03:59,435
I know his name!
He called Jake at the house.

829
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:04,940
Talk to me, Sul.

830
01:04:05,525 --> 01:04:08,402
Why did you leave the team
in the middle of the season?

831
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:11,197
Come on, talk!

832
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:13,532
What do you want from me?

833
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:19,705
That jackass Caxton and her
old lady screwing up the team.

834
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:24,543
You know, if Mr. Wyler were alive,
I'd be head coach.

835
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:29,215
I think about that a lot, Terry.

836
01:04:32,677 --> 01:04:34,887
So I just figured, fuck it!

837
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:38,391
I'd do something for me
for a change.

838
01:04:39,226 --> 01:04:42,770
I was close to you guys. I knew
who was in debt, and how deep.

839
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:45,940
So when Jake wanted,

840
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:49,318
I could always finger
who was ready to break.

841
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,741
You're going home from here
with nothing. You know that.

842
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:00,830
Wise will send someone
a lot tougher than me, Terry.

843
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:05,584
Hank, come on.
Man, this is crazy.

844
01:05:08,422 --> 01:05:10,923
- How much trouble are you in?
- Enough.

845
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:15,719
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, Terry.

846
01:05:18,306 --> 01:05:19,765
Hold it!

847
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,774
Hank. Come on, man.
You said you were old and tired,

848
01:05:28,984 --> 01:05:31,485
you're not out of your mind too,
are you?

849
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:36,782
Hank, come on.
This is Terry, man.

850
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:39,493
You're talking to him like he's a friend.
You don't know him.

851
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,455
Just let me take her back with me.

852
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:45,791
Who's gonna hurt her? Wise?
He worships her.

853
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,293
Back off, Sully.

854
01:05:50,005 --> 01:05:51,797
Goddamn you, Terry!

855
01:05:52,007 --> 01:05:53,340
She's worthless!

856
01:06:15,697 --> 01:06:17,031
Come on, Terry.

857
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:19,366
You're no good at this.

858
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,580
It was easy to find you.
Mexico City, Cuernavaca.

859
01:06:24,831 --> 01:06:27,583
I was breathing down your neck
and you didn't know it.

860
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:30,419
Come on, Terry.
I'm taking her back!

861
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:39,178
Son of a bitch!

862
01:06:41,348 --> 01:06:42,348
Jessie!

863
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:44,850
Damn it, Sully!

864
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,311
Go on and get it, Terry!

865
01:06:53,026 --> 01:06:54,401
Stop it!

866
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:57,530
Get off him!

867
01:07:04,663 --> 01:07:06,163
Hank!

868
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,044
You jackass!

869
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:19,552
Terry! Goddamn it.

870
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:22,555
Stop!

871
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,640
- Come on, Terry.
- Okay, stop.

872
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:27,184
- Stop!
- Shut the fuck up!

873
01:07:27,352 --> 01:07:29,562
Back off, Sully.
Get away, please!

874
01:07:29,771 --> 01:07:32,398
- Get away!
- See what you've done?

875
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,733
Give me that fucking gun.

876
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:40,906
He grabbed the gun, Terry.

877
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,908
I couldn't help it.

878
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,577
Come on, let's get out of here.

879
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:47,496
- He's not dead!
- He will be, Terry.

880
01:07:48,081 --> 01:07:49,623
There's no one to help him.

881
01:07:49,874 --> 01:07:51,125
She's right.

882
01:07:52,586 --> 01:07:54,920
Maybe I'll stop bleeding.
What do you think?

883
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,172
Sure. Sure.

884
01:07:58,758 --> 01:08:01,135
You're full of shit, Brogan.

885
01:08:03,096 --> 01:08:05,389
- We gotta do something...
- Do what?

886
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,434
Take him to a Mexican jail, with a body and a gun?
Are you crazy?

887
01:08:08,602 --> 01:08:10,519
It's not our fault.
We can explain it.

888
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:14,440
We can't, Terry! Let's just get out!
Let's go! Let's run!

889
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,775
This isn't something
we can run from anymore!

890
01:08:16,985 --> 01:08:19,320
Oh, God! You're so innocent!

891
01:08:20,113 --> 01:08:23,032
You just don't understand! Do you?

892
01:08:25,118 --> 01:08:28,287
Come on, Sul,
hang in there.

893
01:08:28,455 --> 01:08:29,663
Bury me here, Brogan.

894
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:32,625
Forget that shit, will you?

895
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:37,463
What are we doing
down here?

896
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,137
Hank.

897
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:03,906
Jess?

898
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:07,534
Jessie!

899
01:09:11,998 --> 01:09:13,332
Jess!

900
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:16,835
Jessie!

901
01:09:21,174 --> 01:09:23,092
Jess!

902
01:10:32,036 --> 01:10:34,246
Oh, God. Jess, no!

903
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:36,141
Give it to me.

904
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:38,101
All right, I'm not spiking.

905
01:11:38,269 --> 01:11:40,187
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it.

906
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,857
Nice. You playing with
your high heels on?

907
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:47,820
- Impressive.
- Terry.

908
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:52,825
Now see, if I like a guy and it looks
like I'll never see him again,

909
01:11:53,034 --> 01:11:55,160
I don't worry.
You know why?

910
01:11:56,162 --> 01:11:59,331
Because I always get lucky.
Thanks, honey.

911
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,834
You're working up a sweat.
That's good.

912
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,377
I love sports, Terry.

913
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:06,004
You know that.

914
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:09,091
Okay.

915
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:11,009
An Outlaws game is starting.
Come on up.

916
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:14,513
Tommy, head into town.
Call me after the games, okay?

917
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:19,726
So did you notice?
I'm walking without a limp.

918
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:23,689
You got your life together, Jake.
I'm impressed.

919
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:28,861
You know, Ter,
there's never just one game.

920
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,238
There's always a whole
mess of them.

921
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,198
Like life.

922
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:36,201
You get hit hard by one,

923
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:39,371
you get blessed
by a couple of others.

924
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,375
You still like football, don't you?

925
01:12:44,669 --> 01:12:46,879
I love the game, myself.

926
01:12:47,088 --> 01:12:48,297
Business and pleasure.

927
01:12:50,758 --> 01:12:52,384
You got a new conditioning coach.

928
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,178
Did you know that?

929
01:12:55,388 --> 01:12:57,723
Sully's gone.

930
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:02,060
When the hell
are you going to tell me?

931
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:03,937
What happened to you down there?

932
01:13:06,107 --> 01:13:07,900
I decided it was a shit job.

933
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:09,735
So you just walked away from it?

934
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,279
You still looking for her?

935
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:17,743
- Didn't you find her yet?
- It's none of your business, Terry.

936
01:13:17,952 --> 01:13:21,705
You didn't finish the job, so I don't
owe you the rest of the money. Okay?

937
01:13:21,915 --> 01:13:25,459
I figure you just came over
today to say we're still friends.

938
01:13:25,627 --> 01:13:28,378
- Am I right? Tell me I'm right.
- No.

939
01:13:28,755 --> 01:13:30,839
No. I just wanted to tell you
to your face to eat it.

940
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:33,425
That's nice.

941
01:13:33,593 --> 01:13:37,220
You mentioned having something on me?
You hang me, you hang yourself.

942
01:13:38,806 --> 01:13:40,599
Go to hell.

943
01:13:41,643 --> 01:13:44,603
It's not that easy, Terry.
There's other people involved.

944
01:13:44,812 --> 01:13:46,271
It's just not you and me.

945
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:49,316
If you want to play football again,

946
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:51,944
there's something you gotta do.

947
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:53,987
Another job.

948
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,739
It's gonna help both of us.

949
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:58,659
You didn't hear what I said, did you?
It's finished with us.

950
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:02,788
Don't you feel you owe me
just a little something?

951
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:05,457
Hello, Terry.

952
01:14:13,633 --> 01:14:15,550
She look great, or what?

953
01:14:18,972 --> 01:14:21,264
Christ, would you look
at that defense, huh?

954
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:24,810
It's like the whole team's
gone out of shape without Sully.

955
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:29,356
Sully is missed.
I can tell you that.

956
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:36,488
Don't leave.
Stay and watch the game, man.

957
01:14:36,698 --> 01:14:38,490
If you want,

958
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,325
you can even place a bet.

959
01:14:40,994 --> 01:14:42,536
Some other time.

960
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:45,706
Oh, hey. There's a party
at the Palace tomorrow night.

961
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,791
You'll hear some good music.

962
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:50,168
And I'll tell you all about that job.

963
01:14:50,378 --> 01:14:52,587
This is something
you've got to do for yourself.

964
01:14:52,839 --> 01:14:55,716
Because your career's
all you got now, my friend.

965
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,010
So I'll expect you, right?

966
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,855
Hey, get out of there!
Get out!

967
01:15:10,064 --> 01:15:12,024
Get out of there!

968
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,944
Have you been all right?

969
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,906
Wait till I get my wind back, will you?
Get your dog out of here.

970
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:22,617
Come on, Sam.

971
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,911
I think about you.

972
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:27,205
I think about you too, lady.

973
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:30,876
- Let's leave it at that, huh?
- You've gotta understand who I am.

974
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:34,129
Someone's always been there
to take care of things.

975
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:37,049
You couldn't handle what happened to Sully.
I had to come back.

976
01:15:37,884 --> 01:15:41,887
It was either Jake or my mother.
And I couldn't go to her.

977
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:44,723
Terry, he knows about Sully.

978
01:15:45,892 --> 01:15:48,477
What's he know?
What did you tell him?

979
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:50,896
Terry, he could hurt us.

980
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:53,065
You mean he could hurt me.

981
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:56,568
Just do what he wants
and finish it with him.

982
01:15:57,236 --> 01:16:00,072
Are you scared for me, Jess? Huh?

983
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,448
Yes.

984
01:16:02,575 --> 01:16:05,410
You know, I've been down there
looking for you.

985
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:09,372
I came back hoping somebody might know something.
I was worried about you.

986
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:13,251
You came back to this fuck.

987
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:16,171
I love you.

988
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:18,298
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

989
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:42,114
Todd, how you doing?

990
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,282
Let's go upstairs
and talk some football.

991
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:47,327
- You're here to watch the show.
- Catch me when I'm in the mood.

992
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:48,620
Tommy.

993
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:50,288
Hang out at the bar.

994
01:16:50,456 --> 01:16:52,958
You want to talk,
maybe Tommy will listen.

995
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:57,587
Look, Jake, he never writes anything down.
I don't even know if he can write.

996
01:16:57,755 --> 01:16:59,005
- Hey.
- I don't trust...

997
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:03,426
Watch your mouth when you fucking
talk about Tommy. Do you hear me?

998
01:17:03,636 --> 01:17:07,722
Now if not, okay, go play your money
someplace else. Hi. How are you? Go on.

999
01:17:08,474 --> 01:17:10,058
Go on.

1000
01:17:12,812 --> 01:17:13,979
I'll be in the bar.

1001
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,355
He'll be at the bar.

1002
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:19,192
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.

1003
01:17:19,819 --> 01:17:21,987
Glad you showed up.
That's nice.

1004
01:17:22,155 --> 01:17:23,822
Came to get your stink
off me.

1005
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:27,659
Listen, pal, I'm not the one
who blew this friendship, okay?

1006
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:30,996
- Where's Jessie?
- She stayed at home. She's upset.

1007
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:33,081
I don't know what it could be.
What you think?

1008
01:17:33,332 --> 01:17:36,960
- I think you've got a lot of friends.
- Go mingle with them. Okay?

1009
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:39,212
Tommy,
show Terry to his table.

1010
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:41,339
Talk to you later.

1011
01:17:50,558 --> 01:17:52,684
I want something in return.

1012
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:54,936
I want a complete catalog
on Bob Marley.

1013
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,980
Everything, all the records.

1014
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,982
And I want live concerts.
Everything.

1015
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,692
- Listen, if I ask him to...
- Hi.

1016
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,694
You heard about this band?

1017
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:04,362
No.

1018
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:06,531
It's supposed to be great,
I can't wait.

1019
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,408
What are you doing here?

1020
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:11,912
If you have something to say to me,
say it and get out.

1021
01:18:14,415 --> 01:18:15,874
This guy looks familiar. Why?

1022
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:19,753
Listen, smart ass,
just get out of here.

1023
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:23,632
Okay.
Uh, Tommy?

1024
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:28,386
Hey, Tommy.

1025
01:18:31,766 --> 01:18:33,475
Go ahead.

1026
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,060
Hey, Tommy!

1027
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:38,063
- This guy a friend of yours?
- Go ahead.

1028
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:44,444
This guy the show, or what?

1029
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:47,530
Sit down!

1030
01:18:50,034 --> 01:18:51,785
You're such a prick.

1031
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,295
Thank you!

1032
01:19:02,546 --> 01:19:06,633
Well, the good news is that some
of my best friends are here tonight.

1033
01:19:07,093 --> 01:19:09,594
The bad news is,
the rest of you are here.

1034
01:19:09,804 --> 01:19:12,681
It's a good thing I'm in the music
business instead of in comedy.

1035
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,809
Okay, a great act tonight,
straight from my hometown.

1036
01:19:16,102 --> 01:19:17,602
Where's my hometown?

1037
01:19:17,812 --> 01:19:20,772
<i>Nueva</i> York, New York City.
The Big Apple. Yeah!

1038
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:26,069
Rotten to the core, as tonight's
group will aptly demonstrate.

1039
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:28,822
They think of themselves
as tropical gangsters,

1040
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:32,367
but we like to call them
Kid Creole and the Coconuts.

1041
01:21:55,928 --> 01:21:58,388
Planning Commissioner Soames.

1042
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:00,432
Dealing with politicians now.

1043
01:22:05,104 --> 01:22:06,604
I'm a top sports accountant.

1044
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:09,357
Bob Soames has been a client
for a long time.

1045
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:11,734
I only deal with uptown people.

1046
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:14,028
Like this guy I'm sitting with?

1047
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,823
Kirsch? As a matter of fact,
this job I have for you,

1048
01:22:17,074 --> 01:22:18,950
it's got to do with Kirsch.

1049
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:23,746
You're really coming up in the world.
Lawyers, politicians.

1050
01:22:23,956 --> 01:22:26,416
I've done business
with Kirsch for a long time.

1051
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:31,546
Yeah. Sully too.

1052
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:34,257
Sully kept me up on injuries
that might affect upcoming games.

1053
01:22:35,092 --> 01:22:36,176
Kirsch let me know

1054
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:39,053
what players wouldn't have
their contracts renewed.

1055
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:40,930
I had it great.

1056
01:22:42,433 --> 01:22:44,476
It's a shitty business, Jake.

1057
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:46,769
Well, it's a shitty world, Terry.

1058
01:22:48,314 --> 01:22:52,317
You see, Kirsch and Sully
fixed a game behind my back.

1059
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:55,778
Kirsch placed what I thought
was an off-the-wall bet.

1060
01:22:55,988 --> 01:22:58,323
But when he won big,

1061
01:22:58,491 --> 01:23:00,992
I paid the cocksucker.

1062
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,913
I guess he figured when I lost Jessie,
I was ripe for being screwed.

1063
01:23:05,164 --> 01:23:06,581
Must be an epidemic.

1064
01:23:06,832 --> 01:23:09,626
- How'd you find out?
- Your friend.

1065
01:23:09,877 --> 01:23:11,169
Sully.

1066
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:14,088
Kirsch, the greedy son of a bitch,
cheated Sully on his cut.

1067
01:23:14,298 --> 01:23:17,842
So he came up here, figured there would
be some money telling me about it.

1068
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:20,970
Poor fucking Sully.

1069
01:23:22,014 --> 01:23:24,307
I'd like to kick the shit
out of Kirsch.

1070
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:27,519
The asshole's got files on me.

1071
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:30,021
And I'm the dumb fuck
who's supposed to get them for you?

1072
01:23:30,356 --> 01:23:32,273
He's got records of the games.

1073
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:35,527
Of the business I did
with the players.

1074
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:37,111
Know who that includes?

1075
01:23:38,656 --> 01:23:41,199
You got no smart-mouth remark
for that one?

1076
01:23:41,534 --> 01:23:45,537
Here. These will get you into
Kirsch's building and the office.

1077
01:23:45,996 --> 01:23:49,207
Sunday night. Late.
It's a little dirty,

1078
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:51,876
but not so dirty
you won't sleep nights.

1079
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,045
Why me? Why not Tommy?

1080
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:55,463
I want Tommy clean.

1081
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:00,552
You? I was ready to be
your friend for life.

1082
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:03,137
You owe me.
This is what I want from you.

1083
01:24:03,347 --> 01:24:06,432
It's in our mutual interest.
As far as I'm concerned,

1084
01:24:06,684 --> 01:24:09,561
it finishes all the shit
between us.

1085
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:13,523
I'm missing the show.

1086
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:18,403
What the hell made you think
you could handle Jessie?

1087
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,321
I bet you brought her flowers.

1088
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,158
You don't have to do that
when you're living in the jungle.

1089
01:24:24,868 --> 01:24:27,954
You just take her outside, show her
what tree you're gonna do it under.

1090
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,837
Hell, we hit lots of trees.

1091
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:03,239
Shit! Now you follow me into the fucking toilet.
Give me a break, please.

1092
01:25:04,074 --> 01:25:06,951
- What is this?
- It's a warning. Be careful.

1093
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:10,079
Okay, Terry. I'm going to be
very careful, all right?

1094
01:25:10,289 --> 01:25:11,497
Just fuck right off.

1095
01:25:11,749 --> 01:25:15,293
You think we're sitting at
the same table by accident? Hm?

1096
01:25:16,295 --> 01:25:19,297
I figure the bet was you'd
make a scene. We'd be noticed.

1097
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:21,424
Really? Hm.

1098
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:26,304
I'm looking out for myself.
I've done what I can for you.

1099
01:25:27,306 --> 01:25:29,223
Okay, fuck off.

1100
01:26:17,147 --> 01:26:20,316
I keep thinking of what I did
to make me deserve you.

1101
01:26:20,526 --> 01:26:22,026
Go to hell.

1102
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,529
Oh, I have.
You know that, lady!

1103
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:27,782
What's it like with Jake? Huh?

1104
01:26:27,991 --> 01:26:30,201
When you two are doing it?
Is he good?

1105
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:31,994
Shut up, Terry!

1106
01:26:32,204 --> 01:26:35,039
Does he have a bigger cock
than I do? Huh?

1107
01:26:35,207 --> 01:26:36,791
Shut up!

1108
01:26:59,106 --> 01:27:01,190
Do you know what
he wants me to do for him?

1109
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,987
You and I have seen worse.

1110
01:27:07,531 --> 01:27:11,617
Jake's a gambler. He thinks I took
his luck when I took you.

1111
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:15,496
I hit him too hard.

1112
01:27:15,748 --> 01:27:17,165
Then get out
of it now.

1113
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:21,210
But what about all the things
you and I shared, Jess? Hm?

1114
01:27:21,712 --> 01:27:23,713
What about Sully?

1115
01:27:24,631 --> 01:27:25,840
Hm?

1116
01:27:26,216 --> 01:27:28,718
You remember him?

1117
01:27:28,927 --> 01:27:31,637
That guy we killed down there
in the jungle.

1118
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:39,145
He's got me one way
or the other, doesn't he?

1119
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:42,356
Huh? Doesn't he?

1120
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,364
Yeah, go ahead,
you rip the shirt off. Come on.

1121
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:53,743
Rip the shirt off.

1122
01:27:57,122 --> 01:27:59,791
Rip the fucking shirt off!

1123
01:28:10,469 --> 01:28:14,096
What am I gonna do, Jess?

1124
01:28:14,681 --> 01:28:16,933
Oh, Terry! I'm sorry.

1125
01:28:17,184 --> 01:28:21,312
- I'm so sorry.
- I love you.

1126
01:28:21,563 --> 01:28:23,231
Hold me.

1127
01:28:24,274 --> 01:28:26,108
Hold me.

1128
01:28:26,318 --> 01:28:28,569
What are we gonna do?

1129
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:51,634
Is this Sam?

1130
01:28:51,844 --> 01:28:56,305
Is this Sam? I bet it is Sam, is it?
There's Sam.

1131
01:28:57,516 --> 01:29:01,310
Sam's crazy about me.
That's a fact.

1132
01:29:02,312 --> 01:29:05,022
You know, dogs kill
for people they love.

1133
01:29:05,524 --> 01:29:08,609
Maybe Sam knows
I'd kill for you.

1134
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:10,111
- What do you mean?
- See that?

1135
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,864
Now you're looking at me.

1136
01:29:13,156 --> 01:29:16,117
Why do I have to frighten you
to get you to look at me?

1137
01:29:18,036 --> 01:29:19,704
I give you everything you want.

1138
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:24,876
Your mother and Caxton can't stomp on me.
You're not even afraid of them anymore.

1139
01:29:27,004 --> 01:29:28,421
Jake.

1140
01:29:31,341 --> 01:29:34,176
You know, when you came
at me with a knife,

1141
01:29:34,386 --> 01:29:37,555
all I could think of
was that you'd hurt yourself.

1142
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:41,809
I'm not spitting in your face.

1143
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,478
I just want you to let me go.

1144
01:29:45,188 --> 01:29:48,149
When we were first together,

1145
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,526
it was so great.

1146
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:55,323
I finally impressed those fucks
in Beverly Hills. Remember?

1147
01:29:56,867 --> 01:29:58,659
You know what was even better?

1148
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:00,912
You were smart.

1149
01:30:02,372 --> 01:30:04,081
You really helped me.

1150
01:30:06,418 --> 01:30:08,502
But I don't care about
any of that now.

1151
01:30:09,588 --> 01:30:11,380
I need you.

1152
01:30:12,382 --> 01:30:14,550
It's just not okay
to be alone anymore.

1153
01:30:16,345 --> 01:30:17,595
No, Jake.

1154
01:30:18,138 --> 01:30:19,764
No.

1155
01:30:19,932 --> 01:30:23,935
You ruined my life.
Goddamn it, I'm not gonna lose you.

1156
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:13,359
<i>He's got files on the business I did
with the players.</i>

1157
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:16,862
<i>You do want to play ball again,
don't you, Terry?</i>

1158
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,376
<i>Sunday night.</i>

1159
01:31:30,627 --> 01:31:32,294
<i>Late</i>.

1160
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:37,508
<i>It's a little dirty, but not so dirty
you won't sleep nights.</i>

1161
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,769
Steve?

1162
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:22,981
Steve?

1163
01:35:43,797 --> 01:35:45,881
This is the rest
of what Jake owes you...

1164
01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:53,115
Jesus Christ! What?

1165
01:36:53,325 --> 01:36:55,826
I hid the body.
They'll find it sooner or later.

1166
01:36:55,994 --> 01:36:57,786
He killed him?

1167
01:36:57,996 --> 01:37:00,581
- He had him killed?
- Shh. Edie.

1168
01:37:00,832 --> 01:37:02,333
Oh, my God.

1169
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:06,712
Not that it's any great loss, but...

1170
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:11,175
Look, Jake Wise planted
something up in his office

1171
01:37:12,093 --> 01:37:13,594
to frame me.

1172
01:37:13,845 --> 01:37:16,180
I didn't find it in time.

1173
01:37:16,514 --> 01:37:18,599
Oh, they're all bastards.

1174
01:37:19,184 --> 01:37:22,478
- All of them.
- Look, Edie, I need your help.

1175
01:37:22,687 --> 01:37:24,688
You worked with Kirsch
for a long time.

1176
01:37:26,232 --> 01:37:28,192
You could knock the hell
out of them.

1177
01:37:29,194 --> 01:37:30,235
What do you mean?

1178
01:37:31,488 --> 01:37:34,156
I don't know what Jake planted.

1179
01:37:34,366 --> 01:37:39,119
But Kirsch kept a tiny treasure chest
that could blow everybody up.

1180
01:37:41,247 --> 01:37:42,873
I shouldn't be this drunk.

1181
01:37:43,124 --> 01:37:45,334
Listen, if the booze helps...

1182
01:37:47,754 --> 01:37:51,507
I can't believe this is my life. Ugh.

1183
01:37:53,676 --> 01:37:56,720
Where was this box?

1184
01:37:56,888 --> 01:37:58,138
Terry...

1185
01:37:59,224 --> 01:38:01,225
I'd be too scared to do it.

1186
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:04,686
You worked for Kirsch. You knew most
of what he knew. They know that.

1187
01:38:04,896 --> 01:38:08,148
Edie, they'll kill you too.

1188
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,401
Edie, help me.

1189
01:38:11,403 --> 01:38:14,196
- But it means...
- What?

1190
01:38:14,406 --> 01:38:17,491
Going back there.
To Kirsch's office.

1191
01:38:57,115 --> 01:38:58,699
There shouldn't be a dog in here.

1192
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:02,327
Who the hell are you?

1193
01:39:03,246 --> 01:39:05,706
I worked for Kirsch.

1194
01:39:05,957 --> 01:39:08,125
You must be the one
who unemployed me.

1195
01:39:12,589 --> 01:39:13,964
Sit.

1196
01:39:15,633 --> 01:39:17,634
- Are the others here?
- Mm-hm.

1197
01:39:17,802 --> 01:39:20,929
They're all over the building.
Looking for the body.

1198
01:39:25,226 --> 01:39:26,393
Some mess.

1199
01:39:26,644 --> 01:39:28,145
We're gonna find him.

1200
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:36,320
Jake wants certain things
out of the office right away.

1201
01:39:37,655 --> 01:39:39,239
Why?

1202
01:39:41,951 --> 01:39:44,244
I guess he's a little jumpy.

1203
01:39:45,997 --> 01:39:48,248
Things seem to be
disappearing tonight, don't they?

1204
01:40:15,693 --> 01:40:17,528
Your dog bothers me.

1205
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,947
It's supposed to bother people.

1206
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:24,117
Put him in there, please.

1207
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:26,662
No.

1208
01:40:32,710 --> 01:40:36,338
You're making this take
much more time than it has to.

1209
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:39,675
Mister...

1210
01:40:40,385 --> 01:40:42,386
Mr. Wise is waiting for me.

1211
01:40:45,932 --> 01:40:47,432
Listen,

1212
01:40:48,226 --> 01:40:50,185
you're not a security guard.

1213
01:40:50,436 --> 01:40:53,730
But I belong here.
Now put the goddamn dog in there!

1214
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:04,366
Come on.

1215
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:12,249
Stay.

1216
01:41:39,027 --> 01:41:40,319
Yeah?

1217
01:41:40,737 --> 01:41:41,778
Hello, Mr. Wise.

1218
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:47,909
No, we haven't found Kirsch's body.
Don't worry about it.

1219
01:41:49,245 --> 01:41:52,623
Don't get excited. We'll find it.
Gonna take it a floor at a time.

1220
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:55,208
I'm sure of it.

1221
01:41:55,418 --> 01:41:58,754
No, we're in the office
looking for those papers you wanted.

1222
01:42:01,007 --> 01:42:03,300
The ones you asked that girl to get.

1223
01:42:04,802 --> 01:42:05,886
Hey, come back here!

1224
01:42:07,305 --> 01:42:10,140
- Get back!
- You crazy bitch!

1225
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:11,892
Who are you? Goddamn it!

1226
01:42:12,143 --> 01:42:13,310
Who the hell are you?

1227
01:42:21,819 --> 01:42:24,237
You little punk! You're dead!

1228
01:42:36,292 --> 01:42:37,501
Argh!

1229
01:42:42,173 --> 01:42:44,007
Run, Edie!

1230
01:43:06,155 --> 01:43:07,447
Come on!

1231
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:10,033
Edie!

1232
01:43:11,869 --> 01:43:14,454
- Did you get the papers?
- Yes, I got them!

1233
01:43:17,667 --> 01:43:18,959
Hey!

1234
01:43:19,335 --> 01:43:21,962
- Here, I'll park it for you.
- I live here.

1235
01:43:33,516 --> 01:43:34,808
Jessica.

1236
01:43:35,727 --> 01:43:36,977
Hello, Mother.

1237
01:43:39,355 --> 01:43:40,605
You're looking well.

1238
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:42,983
I need to see Ben.

1239
01:43:43,526 --> 01:43:45,110
I've missed you.

1240
01:43:46,863 --> 01:43:48,739
Please get Ben, Mother. Please.

1241
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,907
He's much too busy celebrating.

1242
01:43:51,576 --> 01:43:54,911
Bob Soames changed his vote
on Wyler Canyon.

1243
01:43:55,705 --> 01:43:56,747
Why do you want Ben?

1244
01:43:58,124 --> 01:43:59,916
I just wanna talk to him
about something.

1245
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:04,755
- You can talk to him tomorrow.
- No, I need to speak to him now!

1246
01:44:05,006 --> 01:44:07,174
- Right now!
- Keep your voice down.

1247
01:44:07,425 --> 01:44:09,926
I'll embarrass you, Mother.

1248
01:44:10,136 --> 01:44:14,097
I'll just walk right in there
and I'll be my sweet self.

1249
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:15,599
Hello, Jessie.

1250
01:44:16,434 --> 01:44:18,602
Hello, Ben.

1251
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:21,271
I have to talk to you, alone.

1252
01:44:22,648 --> 01:44:24,024
- Excuse us.
- Sure.

1253
01:44:24,275 --> 01:44:25,942
Let's go in there.

1254
01:44:27,779 --> 01:44:29,571
- Jake's had Kirsch killed.
- What?

1255
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:32,073
He's made it look like Terry did it.

1256
01:44:32,283 --> 01:44:35,535
He was trying to get Terry for what he
did with me, but it's more than that.

1257
01:44:35,745 --> 01:44:38,538
He's been fixing games
and betting against his own bank.

1258
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,415
Kirsch was making the bets
for him.

1259
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:43,084
Something's going down
at Kirsch's office.

1260
01:44:43,294 --> 01:44:46,630
- Brogan wouldn't have gone back.
- Why would he?

1261
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:48,298
He'd be crazy to.

1262
01:44:48,466 --> 01:44:51,802
Would you get over there and find
out what's going on? Come on.

1263
01:45:07,693 --> 01:45:09,778
You've gotten out of hand, Jake.

1264
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:13,949
Come on, Tommy.

1265
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,959
What've you done to me?

1266
01:45:25,002 --> 01:45:27,254
He's here to help me, not hurt you.

1267
01:45:27,713 --> 01:45:29,422
The things you don't know.

1268
01:45:29,674 --> 01:45:33,468
This man that you, your mother
and everybody thinks so much of,

1269
01:45:33,636 --> 01:45:34,678
he's my bank.

1270
01:45:36,097 --> 01:45:37,180
I work for him.

1271
01:45:38,015 --> 01:45:39,683
Ben?
Yeah.

1272
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:42,853
Ben. You told him everything,
didn't you?

1273
01:45:43,855 --> 01:45:45,856
Didn't you?

1274
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:49,192
Oh, God.

1275
01:45:49,443 --> 01:45:53,488
You're still trying to kill me.
This time I might just be dead.

1276
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,701
Jake.

1277
01:46:02,373 --> 01:46:04,207
I love you, Jessie.

1278
01:46:05,877 --> 01:46:08,169
Why did that have to be
a bad thing?

1279
01:46:10,047 --> 01:46:12,215
I tell you,
I didn't mean anything bad.

1280
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:17,971
Your office is still busy.

1281
01:46:21,851 --> 01:46:23,101
Yeah?

1282
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:25,738
That you, Brogan?

1283
01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:26,688
Here.

1284
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:29,024
Hello, Brogan.

1285
01:46:29,191 --> 01:46:30,525
Who's this?

1286
01:46:30,776 --> 01:46:34,696
Hey, <i>Se単or</i> Caxton!
Couldn't catch the game tonight.

1287
01:46:34,906 --> 01:46:36,448
We won. Listen, Brogan,

1288
01:46:37,158 --> 01:46:40,076
I'm getting into this
because of my goddaughter, Jessica.

1289
01:46:40,369 --> 01:46:43,830
I'll tell you, there's somebody else
you gotta help tonight, Caxton.

1290
01:46:44,332 --> 01:46:46,082
Yourself.

1291
01:46:48,419 --> 01:46:50,921
I've just been in Kirsch's safe.

1292
01:46:51,547 --> 01:46:54,925
You know what he had in there?
The goods on you,

1293
01:46:55,927 --> 01:46:59,304
Supervisor Phillips,
a whole lot of people.

1294
01:46:59,555 --> 01:47:01,765
I know all about Soames.

1295
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:05,393
You know, the commissioner
who wanted to

1296
01:47:05,603 --> 01:47:09,272
protect the environment
but liked to bet on football too.

1297
01:47:10,775 --> 01:47:13,818
Guess he found out the two
don't mix, didn't he, Caxton?

1298
01:47:14,487 --> 01:47:16,363
I think we should meet.

1299
01:47:16,614 --> 01:47:17,864
I got no problem with that.

1300
01:47:18,115 --> 01:47:21,618
As a matter of fact, I know a great place.
Wyler Canyon, in an hour.

1301
01:47:21,827 --> 01:47:24,371
The spot where you're gonna break
ground in a couple of weeks.

1302
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,414
I know the place.

1303
01:47:30,628 --> 01:47:34,714
That idiot football player
you were going to get

1304
01:47:35,091 --> 01:47:37,842
has got me by the balls.

1305
01:47:38,636 --> 01:47:39,928
Come on.

1306
01:47:40,846 --> 01:47:42,305
Jessie.

1307
01:47:42,473 --> 01:47:44,724
You too, Wise.

1308
01:47:58,155 --> 01:48:01,574
Your friend Brogan is
a threat to me, Jessie.

1309
01:48:01,784 --> 01:48:05,537
I don't know what he wants,
but it's got to be settled. Tonight.

1310
01:48:06,455 --> 01:48:08,498
I can't believe this is you, Ben.

1311
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:11,209
I think my mother would snap
if she knew.

1312
01:48:11,377 --> 01:48:13,920
I get things done in this town.

1313
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:16,840
And the people I work for,
like your mother,

1314
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:20,301
have no interest in how that happens.
Just that I do it.

1315
01:48:21,512 --> 01:48:24,806
She wants Wyler Canyon
developed, but she can't

1316
01:48:25,016 --> 01:48:28,018
get through to everybody
with campaign contributions.

1317
01:48:28,185 --> 01:48:32,689
So I have to go into business
with some very strange people.

1318
01:48:32,982 --> 01:48:35,692
Like that asshole next to you.

1319
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:38,028
I don't have to take
this from you, Caxton.

1320
01:48:38,696 --> 01:48:40,030
He's as dirty as I am, Jessie.

1321
01:48:40,865 --> 01:48:44,117
He owns 75 percent of the book
and 75 percent of the club.

1322
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:47,203
I take all the heat while
he sits on his ass.

1323
01:48:47,496 --> 01:48:49,164
Shut him up, Tommy!

1324
01:48:50,541 --> 01:48:54,169
He got you into this. Now convince me
you're not an asshole.

1325
01:48:58,215 --> 01:49:00,008
Come on, Tommy.

1326
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:02,135
They'll never let you sit on top.

1327
01:49:02,386 --> 01:49:05,346
When you had Kirsch killed,
you buried yourself.

1328
01:49:05,556 --> 01:49:07,807
You think they'll ever
do business with you?

1329
01:49:08,059 --> 01:49:09,059
Wise up!

1330
01:49:09,351 --> 01:49:14,230
I'm telling you no one in Beverly Hills is
ever gonna do business with a black man.

1331
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:16,566
Shut up, Jake.
You're a dead man.

1332
01:49:16,734 --> 01:49:18,359
Not yet, Caxton.

1333
01:49:18,569 --> 01:49:20,904
Brogan won't beat anybody.
I'll take care of him.

1334
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:22,947
You still need me.
Put that gun away.

1335
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,824
Take it, Jake.

1336
01:49:25,493 --> 01:49:27,327
My best friend?

1337
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:57,774
Brogan!

1338
01:49:57,942 --> 01:50:01,194
- Watch it, they've got a gun!
- Shut up, Jessie!

1339
01:50:01,403 --> 01:50:03,696
That's okay, Jessie!

1340
01:50:03,864 --> 01:50:06,616
Things have a way of getting
messed up when you're in them.

1341
01:50:06,784 --> 01:50:08,785
I don't expect the best.

1342
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:16,292
What the hell are
you doing, Brogan?

1343
01:50:18,629 --> 01:50:21,756
This mountain's pretty important
to you, isn't it, Caxton?

1344
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:25,969
With what I got from Kirsch's safe,
I can knock all your plans to hell!

1345
01:50:27,054 --> 01:50:29,139
Mrs. Wyler wouldn't like that,
would she?

1346
01:50:29,306 --> 01:50:30,473
What do you want?

1347
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:37,522
- Don't shoot!
- Terry!

1348
01:50:41,485 --> 01:50:43,027
You're trying to kill me!

1349
01:50:43,237 --> 01:50:45,655
What do you think I want?
I wanna stay alive!

1350
01:50:45,906 --> 01:50:47,615
What do you want?

1351
01:50:47,825 --> 01:50:49,826
I didn't want you, Caxton!

1352
01:50:50,494 --> 01:50:52,787
I want Jake's shit out of my life!

1353
01:50:53,664 --> 01:50:55,790
Now I want yours out too!

1354
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,917
That's all you want?

1355
01:50:58,169 --> 01:51:00,128
Why don't I believe you?

1356
01:51:01,547 --> 01:51:03,590
Because you're a corrupt old man.

1357
01:51:28,824 --> 01:51:31,034
Your coverage stinks, Tommy.

1358
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:38,875
What's your deal, Brogan?

1359
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:43,296
I found out tonight Jake jumps for you.
Slap him down.

1360
01:51:43,547 --> 01:51:45,131
It's that fucking simple, Caxton.

1361
01:51:46,217 --> 01:51:48,843
I'll keep Kirsch's stuff
until I'm satisfied.

1362
01:51:52,681 --> 01:51:54,390
That can be arranged.

1363
01:51:55,643 --> 01:51:57,227
Are you crazy?

1364
01:51:57,394 --> 01:51:59,646
Don't let this punk beat you.

1365
01:51:59,897 --> 01:52:04,025
It can still work. Sully the trainer,
Kirsch the lawyer, and Brogan the player,

1366
01:52:04,193 --> 01:52:07,445
all cheating each other on the fix!
- Knock it off, Jake!

1367
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:12,033
Drop the gun.

1368
01:52:13,827 --> 01:52:15,078
Drop the fucking gun.

1369
01:52:19,416 --> 01:52:23,127
Take the gun away from her head.
You're not gonna hurt her.

1370
01:52:24,546 --> 01:52:27,090
You wanna gamble with me, Terry?
Go ahead.

1371
01:52:30,261 --> 01:52:31,678
Go ahead.

1372
01:52:37,685 --> 01:52:39,727
Take the gun away.

1373
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,522
You were my friend. You know me.
Take your shot.

1374
01:52:54,285 --> 01:52:56,786
Don't do it, Terry.
He won't hurt me.

1375
01:52:59,915 --> 01:53:02,292
I'm not gonna take that chance.

1376
01:53:07,965 --> 01:53:09,215
Thattaboy.

1377
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:14,429
Don't think about it, Tommy.
I'll blow you away. Step back.

1378
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,931
Step fucking back.

1379
01:53:31,613 --> 01:53:34,991
Who's gonna be a dead man, Caxton?
Not me.

1380
01:53:45,794 --> 01:53:47,003
It's gotta be Terry.

1381
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:52,342
What makes somebody
your friend, Jake?

1382
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,303
How much shit
they're willing to do for you?

1383
01:53:55,471 --> 01:53:57,638
Jake. Jake, don't do it.

1384
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,642
Don't... Jake, I love him!

1385
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,855
Right in my face.

1386
01:54:08,692 --> 01:54:11,110
Right in my fucking face.

1387
01:54:12,863 --> 01:54:14,197
I'll blow him the fuck...

1388
01:54:36,303 --> 01:54:37,303
Jessie.

1389
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:39,138
Keep away from her, Brogan.

1390
01:54:40,015 --> 01:54:41,891
You can't help her with this.

1391
01:54:42,851 --> 01:54:44,394
But you can, Caxton.

1392
01:54:44,645 --> 01:54:46,187
I think so.

1393
01:54:46,814 --> 01:54:50,149
But it means doing things my way.

1394
01:54:50,859 --> 01:54:53,194
I want that stuff from Kirsch.

1395
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:57,407
And Jessie's going back
where she belongs.

1396
01:54:58,367 --> 01:55:00,326
You'll leave him alone, Ben.

1397
01:55:05,582 --> 01:55:10,586
I'll do what you want,
but you'll leave him alone.

1398
01:55:17,594 --> 01:55:21,931
What I'm most happy about is
the opportunity to share this land.

1399
01:55:22,099 --> 01:55:24,100
It's beauty and the beauty
around it

1400
01:55:24,393 --> 01:55:28,563
won't be sitting up here
alone anymore, just going to waste.

1401
01:55:28,772 --> 01:55:33,526
I'm sharing what I believe is the best
location on the West Side.

1402
01:55:33,777 --> 01:55:36,737
Close to Century City
and the ocean.

1403
01:55:37,114 --> 01:55:39,407
We won't crowd the hillsides.

1404
01:55:39,616 --> 01:55:43,453
Each owner will feel that
the canyon belongs to him.

1405
01:55:43,704 --> 01:55:48,541
A sanctuary from the crowding
and crime of the city below us.

1406
01:55:50,335 --> 01:55:54,630
Specifically, I'd like to acknowledge
three public officials

1407
01:55:54,923 --> 01:55:58,968
without whose generous support
we wouldn't be here:

1408
01:56:01,638 --> 01:56:03,806
Supervisor Ed Phillips,

1409
01:56:10,564 --> 01:56:12,398
Councilman Leonard Weinberg...

1410
01:56:12,608 --> 01:56:14,400
Stay here.

1411
01:56:15,944 --> 01:56:17,862
Just remember your promise, Ben.

1412
01:56:20,866 --> 01:56:24,243
And the head of the commission,
Bob Soames.

1413
01:56:24,495 --> 01:56:27,288
Thank you, gentlemen.

1414
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:30,833
Now for the big moment.

1415
01:56:32,836 --> 01:56:36,255
This was the only way you could
get a look at her, eh?

1416
01:56:36,465 --> 01:56:38,174
Nothing stops progress,
does it?

1417
01:56:38,884 --> 01:56:43,596
We had to put it off for six months
until things died down in the press.

1418
01:56:43,847 --> 01:56:45,806
Moving 5 million yards of earth
out of here.

1419
01:56:45,974 --> 01:56:49,101
Enough to fill dump trucks
from here to Nova Scotia.

1420
01:56:50,145 --> 01:56:52,605
This town does
belong to people like you, doesn't it?

1421
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,359
You and her mother control
what she says, what she does.

1422
01:56:57,653 --> 01:57:01,113
There's nothing in the news that
isn't exactly the way you wanted it.

1423
01:57:01,365 --> 01:57:03,991
Jake Wise did things even
he'd freak out about.

1424
01:57:04,701 --> 01:57:07,036
There's a lot of sympathy for her.

1425
01:57:07,829 --> 01:57:09,413
Well, there should be.

1426
01:57:09,665 --> 01:57:12,124
It didn't seem to hurt you, Brogan.

1427
01:57:12,334 --> 01:57:15,920
I heard you got some tryouts
with good teams.

1428
01:57:17,839 --> 01:57:19,382
I'm playing with the Dolphins
next season.

1429
01:57:19,633 --> 01:57:22,718
That's one you couldn't put
a stop to, could you?

1430
01:57:24,471 --> 01:57:25,972
I'll be ready.

1431
01:57:26,223 --> 01:57:28,724
Couple of good years
and I'll quit on my own terms.

1432
01:57:29,017 --> 01:57:32,478
So you're going to leave L.A. Good.

1433
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:37,024
Look, when you need me in court,
I'll be there for her.

1434
01:57:37,234 --> 01:57:40,319
But forget anything else.

1435
01:57:40,571 --> 01:57:44,991
Remember, Brogan,
you're out of her life.

1436
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,539
I figure that's up to her.

1437
01:57:52,708 --> 01:57:54,917
You're not gonna control us forever.

1438
01:57:55,085 --> 01:57:57,003
Believe me.
