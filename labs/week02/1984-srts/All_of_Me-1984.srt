1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,230
<i>~ You took the part ~</i>

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,040
<i>~ That once was my heart ~</i>

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>~ So why not Take all of me? ~</i>

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,590
One-two-three-four.

5
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Take it, Roger.

6
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,910
Ok, Dog.

7
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,450
Oh, God!

8
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,160
Happy birthday, my darling. Oh!

9
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,070
- So how does it feel to be 38?
- Oh, great.

10
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,280
Just think, in 2 years I'll be 40,
in 12 years I'll be 50.

11
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm really excited about this...
It's fun.

12
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,530
- Oh, sweetie!
- Hey, what am I doin' with my life?

13
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,700
What am I doin' with my career?
What am I doin' with us?

14
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,180
- You're boring us.
- Yeah!

15
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,620
Do you love it?
It's an African grave post.

16
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,780
Is that gorgeous?

17
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,350
You bought me a 'grave post'
for my 38. birthday?

18
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,490
Look, I'm sorry. I like it... really.
Look, uh, I've been thinkin'.

19
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,070
Remember that thing you used
to wanna talk about and I never did?

20
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,450
You know, uh, the 'M' word?

21
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,660
Well... I think maybe it's time
that we did the 'M' word.

22
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,830
Roger, I don't think your're ready
to do the 'M' word.

23
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,770
Yeah, I am, honest.
Peggy, I wanna get 'M'd'.

24
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,490
Roger, if you can't say the 'M' word
then you're not ready

25
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,690
- to do the 'M' word.
- I can say the 'M' word. Geez!

26
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,740
Ma... marriage, marriage, of course,
I can say it. What do you think?

27
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,950
We shouldn't get into this right now.
You're gonna be late for work

28
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,160
and you know how daddy hates that.
I just came by to wish you

29
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,770
- a happy, happy 38.
- That's a contradiction in terms.

30
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,450
That was very bodacious.
Hey, Roger Dodger, what it is?

31
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,350
Hey, Bix!

32
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,530
- You makin' any money today?
- A1most as much as I made last night.

33
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,700
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah. Look, Roger, I've been thinkin'

34
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,320
o' joinin' Jimmy Bowers' Big Band.
I want you to come and go with me.

35
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,490
- Oh, I appreciate it, Ty, but...
- No, don't give me that, but jive.

36
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,720
- Hey, look at this face.
- I'm quitting the group, Ty.

37
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,650
- You're doin' what?
- I gotta give up something.

38
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,830
I still have time to make something of
myself as a lawyer, not as a musician.

39
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,650
Oh, this is an unhappy face.

40
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,830
- It's not that unhappy.
- Hey, this is the face of a man

41
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,990
- who has given up the wrong thing!
- Don't pick my nose, ok?

42
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,160
And if you don't correct your thinking
I shall be force to tell the world

43
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,330
- that you are a Honky Mook!
- Tyrone, you really should not call

44
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,950
- another person a Honky Mook.
- And why not?

45
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,120
- Well, for one reason, you're white.
- I am?

46
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Yeah!

47
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,790
- Oh, my God, I am.
- I'm late, Ty, I gotta go.

48
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,150
- I'm doing the right thing, really.
- Be cool! Good jammin' with you, Bix.

49
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,070
Well?

50
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,290
- Well, you're dying all right.
- Ever since I was a child doctors have

51
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,110
- been telling me I'm dying.
- I guess you've had enough practice,

52
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,620
- because you're really doing it now.
- How much time?

53
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,240
- A week, a day...
- A month?

54
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,540
M'mhm.

55
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,720
Good. The phone.

56
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,810
- Got a cigarette? It can't hurt now.
- You don't smoke.

57
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,690
Thank you.

58
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,360
After 32 years of marriage you're
still a naughty little devil!

59
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,370
- Pick up. Maybe it's your wife.
- Oh, ever since she filed for divorce

60
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,850
she hardly ever calls any more.

61
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,370
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuyler,
but Edwina Cutwater is on 1.

62
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,680
- Oh, God. All right.
- It's ok.

63
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,990
I just wanted to tell you
your wife subpoenaed me.

64
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,330
Oh, Gretch, I am so sorry about that.

65
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,560
- I do have to take this call.
- Oh!

66
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,610
- Good morning, Margo.
- Good morning, Roger. Morning, Bix.

67
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,100
Any good ones for me today? Unfairly
victed tenants, farm workers, Indians?

68
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,240
Well, Mr. Van Rensselaer called.
He wants you to fire his chauffeur.

69
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,140
Mr. Spencer sen. wants you to draw up
a pre-marital agreement

70
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,870
for Mr. Spencer jun. And finally,
Mr. Spencer jun. called, he wants you

71
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,290
to tell Mr. Spencer sen. to mind
his own friggin' business.

72
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,220
- May justice prevail.
- Why do I do it?

73
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,390
- I think it's called paying dues.
- I've been paying dues for 11 years.

74
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,990
- I should own the entire club by now.
- Right on, Roger.

75
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,720
No more. I want worthwhile cases.
I want to defend right against wrong!

76
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,160
- And I want a partnership!
- You're telling the wrong people!

77
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,330
I know. I was practicing. Pretty good!
Wadding the messages's very effective.

78
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,500
- I'll do this for Schuyler right now.
- Seymour, she was the 4th woman today

79
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,450
- to tell me she'd been subponenaed!
- Mr. Schuyler, I have to talk to you.

80
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,450
I don't want her on the stand!
Listen, if you haven't got the guts

81
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,560
to handle this the right way,
I'm going to find someone who does!

82
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,290
- Mr. Schuyler...
- I was just gonna call you.

83
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,450
Got Miss Cutwater's files. Go to her.
Edwina claims that she's finally dying

84
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,620
- and needs to get her affairs in order.
- No, I have to discuss my future

85
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,790
- here with you right now.
- Well, we are discussing your future.

86
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,830
- You're going out to Edwina Cutwater.
- I want a partnership.

87
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,200
Listen, the day you give up be-bop and
concentrate on the law, we'll talk!

88
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,730
Start talking. I quit the band.
As of today I'm dedicating myself

89
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,540
full time to my legal career.
Later today I'm going to buy a vest.

90
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,700
- My God, you're serious.
- I am serious.

91
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,490
But I wanna start handling real cases,
big cases, no more trick or treat.

92
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,450
- I waited so long to hear you say that.
- I'm not going out to Edwina Cutwater.

93
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,620
No, no, no! Listen to me. Long after
Edwina is gone from this earth,

94
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,790
her estate is going to generate
more income for this office

95
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,980
than most small countries
see in a year.

96
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,410
And it's gonna take a lot of
very sophisticated legal expertise

97
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,580
to structure and administer these
affairs. Now, you do this for me,

98
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,000
today, go out to her house, and I'll
put you in charge of all that.

99
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,160
Now, if that's not real law,
if that's not big law,

100
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,150
- then I don't know what the hell is.
- The more I think about this thing,

101
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,930
the better it sounds.

102
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,290
Don't look at me like that, will you?

103
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,580
I don't go there as a messenger boy
but as a highly skilled legal advisor.

104
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,790
This is really good. No more being
looked down upon by people that think

105
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,990
they're better than I am because
they're rich. From now on I'm gonna

106
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,310
be respected by people who think
they're better than I am.

107
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,830
Hi. Roger Cobb from Schuyler and
Mifflin to see Miss Cutwater.

108
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,940
- Yes, sir, you are expected.
- I'll show him up.

109
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,330
- Betty Ahrens.
- I'm Roger Cobb.

110
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,830
- Try not to excite her, ok?
- Grayson?

111
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,160
Oh, yes, Madam?

112
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,370
Don't forget to pick up
the invitations and make sure they're

113
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,540
- hand delivered the moment I die.
- The moment you die. Yes, Madam.

114
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,120
- Oh! Oh, Mr....
- Cobb.

115
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,290
Cobb. Oh, yes, you're the tedious one.
Would you mind accompanying me back

116
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,460
to my deathbed? Now, here's the name
of my caterer, and the evening's menu.

117
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,330
Make sure they have plenty
of goose pate, it's marvelous.

118
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,420
Excuse me. Is this for the funeral?
One does not have that at a funeral.

119
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,580
Now, Mr. Fulton Norris is a wonderful
society orchestra. I should like you

120
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,620
- to engage him for the entire weekend.
- Is this for the wake, Ma'am?

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,580
Heavens, no. It's for a party and
I want it to a corker.

122
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,710
- Guess what I'm going to do?
- What?

123
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,240
- I'm going to come back from the dead.
- Oh! And...

124
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,780
- what makes you think you can do that?
- Because I'm rich.

125
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,850
Grayson, come in here, please, over.

126
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,240
Miss Cutwater, this is not a parking
ticket we're talking about here,

127
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,360
this is the, oh, The Grim Reaper.
You cannot bribe the Grim Reaper.

128
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,750
Oh, Mr. Cobb, I spent a lifetime
shackled by freilty and poor health...

129
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,810
wheelchairs and sick beds.
It's my heart, you see. It means well,

130
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,660
but it's alsways been
something of lemon.

131
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,500
I've hat all the money in the world
and not one good chance to enjoy it.

132
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,770
I have never been to Europe.
I've never been anywhere really.

133
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,870
Oh, sure I've ordered from Neiman's
and Gucci's,

134
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,520
but I've never actually been there.
I've never ridden my own horses.

135
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,270
I've never been to the ballet.
I've never danced.

136
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,070
But Cutwater's aren't quitters.
So, I've decided that if my wealth

137
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,460
cannot help me in this life, then by
God, it's going to buy me another one.

138
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,080
- Ah, Grayson.
- You walkie-talkied, Madam?

139
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,250
Yes, please, send in Mr. Prakha Lasa
and what's her name, Fred's daughter.

140
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,370
- Miss Terry, Madam.
- Gas me.

141
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,770
Am I just getting you goose pate
or do you have any legal work for me.

142
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,910
Of course I do. I need you to amend
my will so that what's her name, uh,

143
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,140
Fred's daughter will become inheritor
over my entire estate.

144
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,360
So we must draw up a new codicile.
We need it witnesses. Ah, Your Grace.

145
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,570
It's all, Prakha, come in.
Come in, come in, come in.

146
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,900
Come, come.

147
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,870
- What's going on here?
- Wait.

148
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,150
Who's Fred's daughter?

149
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,940
Hello.

150
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,820
- Hello. I'm Terry Hoskins.
- Roger Cobb. You're Fred's daughter?

151
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,100
- Who the heck is Fred?
- Daddy, come in, please.

152
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,580
- Oh, I'm against the whole thing, I am.
- Daddy is Miss Cutwater's stable man.

153
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,460
- It's unnatural.
- Let me get something straight here.

154
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,630
You want to will all your money to the
stableman's daughter. He's against it.

155
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,710
- No.
- He said...

156
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,370
- You see, I should inherit nothing.
- She should be your soul beneficiary.

157
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,250
- That is correct.
- So you will inherit the estate.

158
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,150
No, she won't.

159
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,460
- What am I missing here?
- Thanks to his Highness Prakha Lasa,

160
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm going to be transmigrated.

161
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,330
- What?
- Transmigrated means that my soul

162
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,500
is going to leave my body forever
and become one with the Universe.

163
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,310
- Then my soul will enter her body.
- Ah, good plan.

164
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,670
I'm sorry but I don't think
it's a good plan at all.

165
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,620
My daughter’s soul leavin' her body
and going off to who knows where?

166
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,040
- Fred, let's not go through again.
- Oh, I know I wasn't much of a father

167
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,670
to her when she was growing up, but l
won't lose her again! No, I won't!

168
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,540
- Zip it, Fred.
- Miss Cutwater,

169
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,710
as your attorney it is my duty
to inform you that the will

170
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,360
could be contested if you're deemed
not of perfectly sound mind.

171
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,380
Why you presumptuous ambulance chaser.

172
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,770
Are you insinuating that I am
not of perfectly sound mind?

173
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,540
No, I wouldn't do that, but I think
practically everybody

174
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,710
- in the solar system would.
- Mr. Cobb, the last thing I need

175
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,320
around here is your ill-informed
negativity. Get out.

176
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,690
Thanks for not exciting her.
All right? There, there.

177
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,070
Terry! No, Prakha, not yet.
Prakha, not yet!

178
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,290
- All right.
- I'm not ready.

179
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,120
- Is everybody here bananas?
- Mr. Cobb,

180
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,660
Let me explain something to you.
You see...

181
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,460
closer please.

182
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,920
That's for bananas, now get out!

183
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,320
- What century is this?
- Now you hurt my hand.

184
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,790
I'm gonna tell Mr. Schuyler
that you're an insolent little toad

185
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,960
- and demand that he fire you.
- Why don't you just enter his body

186
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,990
- and do it yourself?
- And don't you come back, you peasant!

187
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,290
Look, lady, just because my grandpa
didn't rape the environment

188
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,460
and exploit the workers doesn't make
me a peasant! I'm sure he tried!

189
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,070
It's just that as a barber he didn't
have that much opportunity!

190
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,160
Grayson, bring the car
and my hairdresser

191
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,570
and the golden diamond jewelry, over.

192
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,380
- I've got to say, it's brilliant.
- What is?

193
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,000
Your scam. It's legal, it's logical.
Only the bowl was overdoing

194
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,910
- but it's certainly original.
- The bowl, Mr. Cobb, is attuned

195
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,090
to the harmonics of Miss Cutwater's
life force. When her body dies

196
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,250
it becomes a repository of that force
so I hold the bowl and it becomes

197
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,400
- the conduit from her body to mine.
- And you really believe that?

198
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,530
- Yes.
- Of course,

199
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,330
if you're wrong you inherit
20 million bucks.

200
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't want her money.
When I was 15 I ran away from home

201
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,280
thinking I could find myself in the
material world. I found only pain.

202
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,580
His Holiness Prakha Lasa teaches
that possessions transmit pain.

203
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,750
I want something far more valuable
than money, far more elusive for which

204
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,670
I'm giving up my physical being
and become one with the Universe.

205
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,480
And, uh, don't you think that's
just a little bit whacko?

206
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,790
Feel my heart.

207
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,000
You are unhappy.
You are anxious and unfulfilled

208
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,590
because you are not doing
with your life as you wish.

209
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,120
I am at peace.
Which one of us is crazy?

210
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,440
You are. Well, thank you.

211
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,650
- Margo.
- Oh, Mr. Durand called.

212
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,840
He needs you to set up a Bermuda
Corporation so he can write off

213
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,010
- his honeymoon. And a call...
- Forget it. I'm telling Schuyler today

214
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,280
- he's gotta play me or trade me.
- Conference room with Miss Cutwater.

215
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,130
- She's here?
- Also with her doctor, her nurse,

216
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,660
Mr. Mifflin, some English girl
with no bra. And a Hindu

217
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,980
holding a bedpan on a stick.
I don't think you should go in there.

218
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,460
We just have a little bit more left.
Are you strong enough to continue?

219
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,630
What? Oh, I'm fine.

220
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,920
Really. I'm fine. Tell them.

221
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,830
She could drop dead any minute.
Never mind her.

222
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,630
She's only trying
to make me feel good.

223
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,800
I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Madam, I wish to apologize

224
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,960
for upsetting you before.
Mr. Schuyler, if I could see you...

225
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:49,050
- Mr. Cobb, please don't grovel.
- I'm not grovelling,

226
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm apologizing.
If I could see you outside.

227
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,840
If you're trying to save your job,
you're too late.

228
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,040
- What?
- It's quite lost by now.

229
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,920
Let me tell you something. My father
worked himself into an early grave

230
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,170
defending the rights of needy people
in his store front over on 9th Street.

231
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,340
When he died my mother took a job as
a plumber's assistant so I could go to

232
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,510
Law school and carry on in his name!
So now that the only job I can get

233
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,840
is in some skid-row legal aid office!
I'd just as soon take it as...

234
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,750
- That's enough!
- ...explore your energy vampire!

235
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,150
- Suck out my fun of being a lawyer!
- Shut up! Now, that's enough!

236
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,130
I never heard such a moronic load
of crap in my life!

237
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,300
- Well, I don't have to take that.
- No, not you, her. Did you hear

238
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,670
- what she wants to do with her soul?
- Yeah.

239
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,250
- Jesus Christ, she's is looney tune.
- She's nuts!

240
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,990
But you've got guts! I never saw you
stand up to anyone like that before.

241
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,170
You have a fire burning inside you.
To defend people who really need you.

242
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,170
And I never knew that
about your father or your mother.

243
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,880
- I made that up.
- You did?

244
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,000
- Yeah.
- Son-of-a-gun!

245
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,000
- It was pretty good, huh?
- I like a man who thinks on his feet.

246
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,630
- Well, thanks.
- Roger, I have a case that needs

247
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,670
a lawyer just like you. You win it
and I'll put you up for a partnership.

248
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,960
- But not for an rich goofball.
- No, no, no. It's for a very nice man

249
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,080
who's getting divorced.

250
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,880
- I think I'm gonna be a partner.
- Mazeltov!

251
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,820
Oh, Bix, you're gonna be
a partner's best friend.

252
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,510
Call the Fulton Morris Orchestra.
Tell them Miss Cutwater has requested

253
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,710
her favorite saxophone player
Tyrone Wattell for her party.

254
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,920
And she'd like him to receive
a thousand dollars for the night.

255
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,580
We gonna inform Mr. Wattell.
Come on, Bix.

256
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,070
- What a guy!
- Now then...

257
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,960
Mr. Mifflin can witness the codicil.
I will sign as executor of the estate

258
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,530
and then we will be all signed,
sealed and...

259
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Oh, a tunnel...

260
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,400
- Edwina?
- With a very bright light.

261
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,010
- I was afraid of this.
- What the hell's she talking about?

262
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,650
Terry! Prakha!

263
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,870
- What the hell is going on?
- Miss Cutwater?

264
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,950
- Did she sign everything?
- Jan, an S 10... I. V. Hurry!

265
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,910
Call the insurance company.

266
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,360
- How is she? Will she be all right?
- I'm losing her. I'm losing her!

267
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,370
Get out of my way, you fool!

268
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,660
I lost her.

269
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,510
- Where am l?
- What?

270
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,930
- Ah, I'm breathing. I must be alive.
- Who said that?

271
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,590
- No, I can't be. I just died.
- Wait a minute.

272
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,170
I'm picking up General Hospital
in my fillings.

273
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,110
Oh, it worked. Oh, my Lord!

274
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,990
- What the hell's happening to me?
- I feel...

275
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,880
like the healthiest woman alive. Oh!

276
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,050
Who said that? I did. I'm going crazy.

277
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,280
Oh-oh! That does not sound
like Fred's daughter.

278
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,590
No, I'm not going crazy.
Something hit me on the head. Oh!

279
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,630
I'm just hallucinating. That's all!

280
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,550
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

281
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,660
- What the hell are you doing in there?
- Unbelievable! I can't even die right.

282
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,490
- Why are you doing this to me?
- God, don't you get enough laughs?

283
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,870
- What did I ever do to you?
- Somebody tell me this doesn't happen!

284
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,840
I'm afraid it is, so let's just
go inside and have Prakha Lasa

285
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,180
- straighten out this mess.
- Oh, geez! I can't move my right leg!

286
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,300
- I'm paralyzed!
- Here let me try.

287
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Now!

288
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,800
Oh, we... we obviously have
mutual control over our body.

289
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,430
This is my body!
I'm not sharing my body with anyone!

290
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,620
- Everybody's gonna be disappointed.
- Oh, where we going?

291
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,960
- We've got to find Prakha Lasa!
- I can't got in there! Schuyler...

292
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,340
Excuse me, this is a private
conversation, do you mind? Ah, no!

293
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,540
- Please, just do as I say!
- No! Oh!

294
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,050
Oh, you seem to have control
over the left side of your body,

295
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,010
while I feel dominant on the right.

296
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,910
Oh, let go of that.

297
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,370
You bitch! How about a little respect
for the deceased?

298
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,480
Ow! Ow!

299
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,510
Let go of my hand, you brute!
I will not!

300
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,810
Oh, oh! Ow!

301
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,550
Just stop it!
If you want me out of you,

302
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,720
- stop this ridiculous behavior.
- Lady, I don't know how you got in

303
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,280
but I'm gonna get you out of me
right now! Let's go!

304
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,960
Just wait, I'll go first.
Calm down and try to concentrate.

305
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,970
I'm the right side, uh,
and you're the left.

306
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,540
First me, then you.

307
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,080
Me, you.
See, if we just cooperate...

308
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,870
Now all we have to do
is find Prakha Lasa.

309
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,800
- There's something we have to do first.
- What?

310
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,200
- Oh, I have to take a leak.
- Oh!

311
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,340
- Bix, go see Margo.
- Your foot, my foot,

312
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,040
your foot, my foot, very good.
Oh, you're doing wonderfully well.

313
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,100
- Isn't it awful?
- I have no idea.

314
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,410
I can't go in there. That's the
Men's Room. Shut up and do as I say.

315
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,050
- Don't you ever, ever yell at me again.
- I'm sorry,

316
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,050
- this is not my idea of a good time.
- I'm not having my lucky day, either.

317
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,350
I died 5 minutes ago.

318
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,040
- Oh, God! You'll have to do it!
- I'll have to do what?

319
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,830
- You know, take it out.
- Take what out?

320
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,050
- The little fireman.
- The little fireman?

321
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,260
- You know, my penis!
- How dare you say

322
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,850
- penis to a dead person?
- Listen, lady,

323
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,010
if you don't give Big Ed
some air he's gonna piss all over

324
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,140
- your half of my body!
- Mr. Cobb,

325
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,450
if you are trying to scare me,
it won't work.

326
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,920
Oh! Ow! Damnit, stop it!

327
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,680
All right, first let go of your grip!

328
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,880
Now slowly take your hand. Now slowly!

329
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,120
All right,
now we're going to try it again.

330
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,490
Carefully, very carefully.

331
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,450
- What the hell are you doing in there?
- I am trying to release your Mr. Ed.

332
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,430
Stop playing with it already
and take it out.

333
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,600
You don't have to talk out loud.
I can hear your thoughts.

334
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,080
Oh, great, just what I always wanted.

335
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,080
- Shall I tap?
- Yes.

336
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,450
- Tap, tap.
- Thank you.

337
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,670
I meant what I say about yelling.

338
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,970
I was just talking to myself in there.
It wasn't anything really.

339
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,140
- Ah, there's Fred's daughter.
- Yoohoo, Terry. Stop it!

340
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,760
No, I don't use my mouth!
Try to walk more like a man.

341
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
All right!

342
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,470
- Mr. Cobb, I feel so terrible.
- I know. It's not your fault

343
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,130
- it didn't work.
- How do you know it didn't work?

344
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,030
- You won't believe. Where's the Swami?
- He left when those people came in.

345
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,430
- He's very shy, you know?
- Left? Well, where did he go?

346
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,720
- Don't worry, I know where to find him.
- Mr. Cobb?

347
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,630
Do you still wanna go through
this transmigration? Fine.

348
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,250
- Mr. Schuyler needs to see you.
- Fine, thanks.

349
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,890
- Where can we reach you?
- At Miss Cutwater's. Who's we?

350
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,090
- Roger? He said now!
- I'll explain later. Trust me.

351
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,720
- Don't swing your arm so much.
- There's something very odd at Cobb.

352
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,100
He brings a dog to a law office for
3 years and you just noticed he's odd?

353
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,760
- But he's speaking with a funny voice!
- Have you heard his secretary?

354
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,140
And he's impli...

355
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,420
We'll discuss this later!

356
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,720
- Tattle tale!
- Are you feeling all right?

357
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,100
This Cutwater thing got under my skin!
I need to leave for about an hour.

358
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,270
- No! We're going to court tomorrow.
- Court tomorrow. Uh, really, I...

359
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,500
Clear the decks. Sit down.

360
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,600
It's my divorce. Ah, nobody knew.
Tell you the truth,

361
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,830
it's a little embarrassing.
Seymour was representing me,

362
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,850
but he wasn't doing squat!
You want a partnership, you do for me

363
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,760
- what you did in the Brenner case.
- Oh, God, not now.

364
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,930
- Oh, just explain what happened.
- Are you crazy? I don't believe it.

365
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,100
If I tell him he'll have me put away.
Before I can take care of any of this

366
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,350
- there's something very personal...
- Oh, yes, of course. All right,

367
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,520
- sit down, I'll tell you everything.
- Oh, no, no, I meant that I...

368
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,680
Ok, don't be embarrassed. I started
cheating on my wife 3 years ago.

369
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,850
- Oh, goody, man! Talk.
- I never intended to.

370
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,020
- Women just threw themselves at me.
- Oh, you must be joking.

371
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,640
- What?
- I said, uh, must be choking.

372
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,920
- Anyway, I'm Paul Newman or anything.
- You can say that again.

373
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,710
- What?
- I said... could you say that again?

374
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,330
- I'm not Paul Newman?
- Not Paul Newman.

375
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,660
Anyway, it seems that my wife's best
friend suddenly lost her husband.

376
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,270
Women usually do outlive their men.
So, naturally, she found herself

377
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,310
cut off from her
normal sexual relations and...

378
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,480
She turned to you and you comfort her.
I understand, sir,

379
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,640
- you really didn't do anything wrong.
- Believe it. I was incredible.

380
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,810
- I see, sir. I can figure out the rest.
- Oh, and then another one was widowed.

381
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,890
Ok, so 2 little indiscretions.
That's not such a big deal.

382
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,120
And then, another one. And another.
Going to a funeral gave me a hard-on.

383
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,130
Speaking on behalf of the dead,
I find this disgusting!

384
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,930
- I think I got the picture now.
- I'm not sure. It's not just sex.

385
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:52,160
Let me tell you. These sweet darling
ladies gave new purpose to my life!

386
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,950
They gave me the opportunity to give
something back instead of just take!

387
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,270
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, fine!

388
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,470
Anyway, you understand what I say?
I give love and happiness to people

389
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,680
who really need and appreciate it!
I'm the West Coast distributor of

390
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,890
love and happiness. And for that I've
to go court? I don't deserve that!

391
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,890
- I should get a dinner!
- He should get a social disease.

392
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,890
- I won't let you down.
- Well, I'm counting on you! Son.

393
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,540
Shake hands with him. Like a man.

394
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,390
- Crazy musicians.
- You won't regret this.

395
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:36,620
I know I won't. If I do, you'll never
practice in the Free World again.

396
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,480
- I hope you plan on losing that case.
- How did it go, Roger?

397
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,000
- The only thing I plan to lose is you!
- Nice talking to you, Roger.

398
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,130
You have a great deal to learn about
making someone feel welcome.

399
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,680
Let's get something straight here.
I never liked you in your body,

400
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,720
- I certainly don't like you in mine!
- Well, I don't see why you're

401
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,890
- getting so upset about all this.
- Because I want my body back!

402
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,980
And I want my freedom and my privacy.
And most of all, I'd like to be able

403
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,140
- to take a leak without being fondled!
- You may find this hard to believe,

404
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,960
but fondling you while you make
pee-pee is not my idea of a good time.

405
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,580
Fine! Fine! It's two o'clock.

406
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,550
- Round about.
- I have a lot of work to do.

407
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,220
I want you out of me by three fifteen!
Now where's the swami?

408
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,090
Well, he's never been away from Tibet.
So I put him up at the Ambassador.

409
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,020
Let's see. What is that number?
Hotels.

410
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,220
H, H, H, H. Let's see.

411
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,430
Let your fingers do...
Oh, here it is. The Ambassador.

412
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,600
And look over here. The Arlington.
That's where Mummy in spring of '62

413
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,390
had her amethyst stolen from her in
the elevator. It was so distressing!

414
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,090
Give me that!

415
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,510
No. No, he hasn't checked out.

416
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,600
- Oh, dear!
- Yeah, oh, dear. Don't worry, I know

417
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,130
- where to find him. Good going, Edwina!
- It's Miss Cutwater to you!

418
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,890
- Hello, Margo.
- Oh, hi, Peg.

419
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,060
...follows me in a men's room I think
I can be on a first name basis with!

420
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,290
- You told me to pull out your penis!
- How about a cup o' coffee?

421
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,250
- Where is she?
- Oh, boy!

422
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,440
- Where is she?
- There's nobody here.

423
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,000
- Liar! I heard her!
- Peggy, I swear! Nobody else here!

424
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,790
- Come on out, you little slut!
- Oh, who is she calling a slut? Sssh!

425
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,840
I heard that! Come on, deny it!
Where is she?

426
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,250
- It was me. Bix, stop that!
- What was you?

427
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,140
The voice you heard. I was talking to
myself. Hey, your perfume suits you.

428
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,400
- It's cheap and common!
- Ha! At least it was your side.

429
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,060
- Who fondled you in the Men's Room?
- Me.

430
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,190
- Liar!
- How dare she? Edwina!

431
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,480
- Edwina? My name is Peggy, you pig!
- Oh, no, let me explain!

432
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,680
It's Edwina Cutwater!
She died today!

433
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,220
- You did it with a dead woman?
- No!

434
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,400
You are sick! I came here to talk
about our marriage, although I heard

435
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,310
- how you stick by my mother.
- What has your mother to do with this?

436
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,290
Tomorrow you attend the opposite side
against my own mother!

437
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,810
- But I attend your father!
- You gonna tear her off a strip!

438
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,290
- Now, that's...
- If you go to court, it's the end!

439
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,310
And if I don't go,
your father will kick me in my balls.

440
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,590
Either me or your balls, Roger!
You can't get both!

441
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,020
Really a very interesting alternative.
I do not even know the use of balls

442
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,170
but I believe they are more important
for you than for your girl-friend.

443
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,600
- Now?
- I depend too much on them, Peggy.

444
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,540
Farewell, Roger.

445
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,710
By the way, your dog is disgusting!
And jazz is absolutely hare-brained!

446
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,630
Oh! And I faked them,
all those orgasm...

447
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,150
Sound familiar?

448
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,380
Yeah, well, I faked mine, too!

449
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,000
Believe we're better off without her.
She isn't right for us.

450
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,420
Since our little accident, I sensed
a lot of hostility coming from you.

451
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,520
Excuse me! But I'm watching my entire
career going right down the sewer,

452
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,690
'cause I've got a dead woman
living inside me. And only person

453
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,970
that can get you out is cosmic weirdo
you can't even find!

454
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,440
I can so find him! I think! Oh, wait,

455
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,610
I'm sure I know where he'll be
this evening. Do you have a car?

456
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,230
- Oh, this is fun!
- Shift, dammit!

457
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,890
- Shifting, wheee!
- What are you doing?

458
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,640
- I never learned driving! Which...
- The brake not the gas!

459
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,690
- I don't know which it is. Oh!
- Bix, let go of her!

460
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,680
Stop it! Let go! Ow! I'm gonna
strangle this mangy mongrel.

461
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,270
- All right, that's it.
- This is wrong! Where are we going?

462
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,600
It's enough that I've to put up wit
you, but I won't subject Bix to this!

463
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,250
- Tyrone. Great, I gotta talk to you.
- Hey, Roger Dodger!

464
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,270
Got a call from the union about a gig.
They didn't say who recommended me,

465
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,840
- but I smelled your fingerprints...
- It was nothing really.

466
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,980
- Can we get on with this, please?
- Uh, who's that? Someone with you?

467
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,340
- Sort of, yeah.
- Well, introduce me to the lady.

468
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,820
M'm Edwina Cutwater, Tyrone Wattell.

469
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,020
- Please to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

470
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,550
- Hairy knuckles for a chick.
- Can you take care of Bix?

471
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,090
Oh, sure, I... Wait a minute.
Roger, what's wrong?

472
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,820
- I really don't think I can explain it.
- What's wrong, Roger?

473
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,120
Edwina died today. Her soul entered me
and took the right half of my body.

474
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,770
- Why didn't you say straight away?
- I knew you'd understand.

475
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,940
- Thanks for not having me committed.
- I got friends crazier than you,

476
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,110
- but I ain't got many better.
- Thanks, pal. Go with him, Bix.

477
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,300
- C'on, Bix. Nice meetin' you, Edwina.
- Bye.

478
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,250
A woman who would rather buy a candle
than to curse the darkness.

479
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,960
- Pack 'em in don't you?
- Hello! Come in.

480
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,170
- I can start over if you'd like.
- No, thank you.

481
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,420
And we wonder, Oh Lord, what it means
when a person passes away

482
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,020
and so few take the time
to pay final respects.

483
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,020
- Oh, big deal.
- He's not here. Let's got find him.

484
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:45,020
However, we have received a number
of mailgrams, from reaved loved ones.

485
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,190
- Wait, wait, wait! I must hear this.
- I got to prepare the most important

486
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:54,310
- case of my life, let's get out here!
- No, I want to hear these mailgrams.

487
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,940
- Oh, I really got to...
- I mean it, sit!

488
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,560
Very touching. "We will miss her.
The Valley Oxygen Supply Company."

489
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,850
- Oh, that's sweet.
- "She was truly a great customer.

490
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,770
- J & J. Wheelchairs."
- Oh, they remembered.

491
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:16,220
Browning Orthopedic Mattresses:
"May she continue to rest in peace."

492
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:21,510
Oh, how deeply touching.

493
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,090
Mr. Cobb? Mr. Cobb?

494
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,260
Oh, hi! What time is it?

495
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,590
Almost midnight. Now, please tell me
how you knew it didn't work?

496
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,750
Edwina?

497
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,530
- She's asleep.
- Who's asleep?

498
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,720
Edwina. Don't wake her. Wow.

499
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,130
- Great. When she's asleep, I can...
- Mr. Cobb, Miss Cutwater is dead.

500
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,280
No. She's not.
She entered me instead of you.

501
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,400
- What?
- Oh, where's the swami?

502
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,310
- I haven't seen him.
- Maybe he's back at the hotel.

503
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,480
- I just called and there's no answer.
- We should go there and wait for him.

504
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,650
- I gotta find him. I can't take more...
- You poor dear. You must relax.

505
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,210
- Stop worrying.
- No, I think we oughta find him.

506
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,980
I'm sure he'll be at the funeral
tomorrow morning.

507
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,690
And if Miss Cutwater really
is inside you, he will help her

508
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,340
leave your body and enter mine.

509
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,980
I think I envy her.

510
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,690
Mr. Cobb,

511
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,920
this morning,
when I placed your hand on my heart

512
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,060
did you feel anything special?

513
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,260
- Yes, I felt your left...
- Yes!

514
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:11,570
I felt something
very special pass between us.

515
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,730
Oh, Mr. Cobb, by this time tomorrow
my soul will be gone!

516
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,650
I want to know love one last time.

517
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,820
- Don't you think we really oughta go...
- Please. Mr. Cobb,

518
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,590
let me take the memory of passion
to sustain me in the next world.

519
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,420
So this would be
like for a good cause?

520
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,030
Oh, yes.

521
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,010
- We have to be very quiet.
- I'm not sure that will be possible.

522
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,120
My God!

523
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,760
It's a good cause. It's a good cause.
It's a good cause.

524
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,090
I'm ready, Mr. Cobb. Take me!

525
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,260
Sssh, keep sleeping, Edwina. Oh!

526
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,820
Now! Oh!

527
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,770
Now!

528
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,640
What is all this?

529
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,150
- Now!
- What's going on here?

530
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,650
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

531
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,420
- What are you doing to her?
- Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

532
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,400
Go back to sleep, you're dreaming.
Why, Miss Hoskins! You whore!

533
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,490
- You lascivious whore! Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.

534
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,940
- You're a shameless little slut!
- Yes!

535
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,520
- Shut up!
- Talk dirty.

536
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,610
- You're nothing but a cheap sex tramp!
- Good. Good.

537
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,480
Now call me a poodle, Mr. Cobb.
Call me a cheap, slut, sex poodle!

538
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,690
- Why you deserve a good spanking?
- Oh, Mr. Cobb!

539
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,890
- You little bed bunny!
- Edwina, no!

540
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,240
- Mr. Cobb, yes, you love rocket!
- Ah, stop talking like that!

541
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,630
- Oh, spank me again, you bad boy!
- Oh, Edwina, stop it! Edwina!

542
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:28,260
- She should be ashamed of herself!
- And you should, too!

543
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,690
Mr. Cobb?

544
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,860
For God's sake, Edwina, go away!
My body! What if you got pregnant?

545
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,490
You have no right!
No, you have no right!

546
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,530
And you have no class! You're rude,
crude and thoroughly unattractive!

547
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,260
God, it is Miss Cutwater!

548
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm sorry you had such a lousy life.
But just because you never did this

549
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,260
- doesn't mean we have to go without.
- I'm quite proud of my virginity!

550
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,550
- It's something I've always treasured!
- Yeah! Nobody else ever wanted it!

551
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,170
Terry, wait!

552
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,630
Lady, if Prakha cocker
doesn't show up tomorrow

553
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:30,280
I'm gonna get a lobotomy or a high
colonic or something, but you're

554
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,650
- getting the keys to the street!
- Oh, stop being such a martyr.

555
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,860
- I'll pay you for your troubles.
- Maybe. Oh, Jesus, I just realize

556
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,510
why no one showed up at your memorial
service. You forgot to hire mourners.

557
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,710
You are insensitive horse's ass,
do you know that?

558
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,190
- Oh, drop dead!
- Look, Cobb, I am talking to you!

559
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:59,570
For your information, there is a
perfectly good reason nobody showed up

560
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,530
- at my memorial service.
- Yeah, what?

561
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,700
I don't have any friends.

562
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,430
I'm looking back at an entire lifetime
and I don't have one friend.

563
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,360
I've never had any friends.

564
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,680
I've had only nanny's and tutors
and servants and nurses. Oh.

565
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,060
Once my parents hired a clown to
entertain me, but he didn't like me.

566
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,950
And when my parents weren't
in the room he'd just sit there.

567
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:39,430
He didn't lift a finger to amuse me.
Oh!

568
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,430
- That's a terrible clown.
- Yes. Well, that's not all.

569
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,260
When Fred's daughter was a little girl
came to my house to visit her father

570
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,740
and the nurses would push my
oxygen tent over to the bedroom window

571
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,430
so I could watch her and
all her little friends ride my horses

572
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:12,760
and swim in my pool and run and play
and laugh and dance. Oh!

573
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,650
Then I swore. I'd give every cent
I ever had to be able to do all that.

574
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,180
To be free. To be like her.

575
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,230
Well, I've humiliated myself.

576
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,310
Anyway, what I wanted to say was
I'm sorry if I spoiled your birthday.

577
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,780
And I'm sorry if I made you being dead
an unpleasant experience.

578
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,140
Well, I am dead, aren't l?
Oh, please, make me not dead!

579
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:51,430
I can't, Edwina.

580
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,420
No sense wishing.

581
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,930
- Oh, I feel much better.
- It's really late. Go back to sleep.

582
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,280
Well, aren't you coming to bed?

583
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,340
I can't. I gotta prepare for this
case tomorrow. You go to sleep.

584
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,380
Oh, ok.

585
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,680
Good night, Roger.

586
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,410
Good night, Edwina.

587
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,650
Roger? Roger? Roger!

588
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,770
Roger? Roger? Roger!

589
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,140
Wake up! Wake up, Roger.
Funeral time!

590
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,570
Let's go, we've to to get up, Roger!
Come on! Up! Up, up, up! Let's go!

591
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,070
What...

592
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:46,120
- Did you have a good night's sleep?
- Oh, yeah. I got the full seven...

593
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,850
and a half minutes. No problem. Oh!

594
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,340
Ommm! Ring! Ohh!

595
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Oh, Roger!

596
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,870
- All right, I'm awake. I'm awake.
- You have no idea what it's like

597
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:35,480
- to be inside a healthy body!
- I tried to find out last night!

598
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:43,180
I cannot believe you’re still upset
about that. Careful, careful.

599
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,030
Of course you can't. Can we hurry this
up, please? See, your problem is,

600
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,320
you don't understand how to live life.
It's to be experienced and savoured.

601
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,530
I know that, you big dope. Why do you
think I've gone to so much trouble

602
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,240
and expense to buy myself
another chance?

603
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,410
Cause you're under mistaken assumption
that it's going to make a difference.

604
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,570
- It will, too, make a difference.
- You'll still be the same sour puss.

605
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,970
You'll wind up as bitter and alone
as you always have been.

606
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:18,180
I think not. I'm gonna dance, Roger.
I'm gonna twirl and whirl and spin.

607
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:23,240
I'm gonna cha-cha in the rain game.
I'm gonna dip deeply.

608
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,370
- Good, this one.
- It's too unattractive.

609
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:30,560
So's a deep scar. Just do as I say,
we don't have time to argue.

610
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,280
What's the big hurry anyway?
My funeral's not until 10.30.

611
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,450
Cause I have to be in court at 8.30.
How are we gonna make a 10.30 funeral

612
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,810
- if you have to be in court?
- I'll figure it out at 10.29, ok?

613
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,010
You are so cranky when you
haven't had enough sleep.

614
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:53,480
- Did you sign this check?
- Yes.

615
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,030
- And this?
- Yes.

616
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,860
- And this?
- Yes.

617
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,850
- No further question.
- Counsellor?

618
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,020
Roger? Roger! Roger!

619
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:15,410
God! You can't fall asleep on me now.
Counsellor?

620
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,310
Just a second.

621
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:22,930
- Roger, please wake up.
- Counsellor, the Court is waiting!

622
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,560
Well.

623
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,780
- Oh, Your Honor...
- Edwina, a man, act like a man.

624
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,480
Your Honor...

625
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,330
Your Honour, yes...

626
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:59,410
- Proceed with the witness.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

627
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:03,580
- I'm just a little nervous, that's all.
- It's just your career that's a stake,

628
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,610
- that's all. So, don't be nervous.
- Ah, Mr. Schuyler, you didn't really

629
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:12,930
give those women a half million
dollars in gifts now, did you?

630
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,560
Yes, I did.

631
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,310
Well, I'll bet you had a darn good
reason to, now didn't you, sport?

632
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,520
- Why are you acting like this?
- Say yes.

633
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Yes.

634
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:38,810
He had a darn good reason.

635
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,490
- Proceed.
- Proceed?

636
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,490
Proceed, Edwina. Like a man!
Proceed like a man!

637
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,990
Proceed, uh?

638
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:55,660
Wait a second. Every Christmas you
gave me... Miss Cutwater

639
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,790
- darling little gifts, didn't you?
- Yeah.

640
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:03,810
So it is your practice! Indeed,
ladies and gentlemen of the world.

641
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:09,200
It is standard practice among many
business professionals to reward

642
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,180
valued clients with gifts, is it not?

643
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,350
- Oh!
- Yeah. Yes, it is.

644
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,740
Objection. The money in question came
from the Schuyler's personal account,

645
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,020
not from the law firm and therefore
cannot be construed as business gifts.

646
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,520
Good point, Toots.

647
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,950
Oh! Women! Uh, can't live with 'em,
can't live without 'em.

648
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:40,270
Oh, Roger, please, wake up!

649
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,530
Mr. Cobb!

650
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,160
I'm sorry, Roger.

651
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,940
Roger! Roger!

652
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,240
- Oh! Oh! What?
- Mr. Cobb, are you all right?

653
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,160
- Yeah. No problem.
- How do you respond to the objection?

654
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,260
Objection?

655
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,790
- Uh, could you read that back, please?
- The money in question came from the

656
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,950
Schuyler's personal account, not from
the law firm and therefore cannot be

657
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,740
- construed as business gifts.
- Business gifts?

658
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,060
- Sorry, I didn't have another idea.
- Edwina, you're brilliant!

659
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,990
Your Honor,

660
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,660
Mrs. Schuyler's sole source of support
was Mr. Schuyler whose sole source

661
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,830
of income was the law firm. So the
better the law firm's business was

662
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,990
the more money Mr. Schuyler could take
home to Mrs. Schuyler, therefore,

663
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:44,160
since business gifts are intended to
increase business, the more generous

664
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,330
Mr. Schuyler was with his gift giving
the better able he was to support

665
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:53,020
Mrs. Schuyler in the manner
to which she'd become accustomed to.

666
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,010
Give me a minute.

667
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,870
Edwina, I could kiss you. We'll win!
I'm gonna get my partnership and we're

668
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,730
gonna make that funeral! None of those
were clients, but don't tell anyone!

669
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:15,410
- What?
- I'm going to overrule the objection.

670
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:19,240
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Just a second, this isn't fair.

671
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,410
You Honor, I move we dismiss claim
for damages because those women...

672
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:26,740
- Shut up!
- What did you just say?

673
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,870
- Nothing.
- Just tell me what you said.

674
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:33,000
- I didn't say anything.
- Those women...

675
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,160
- Those women were not his clients.
- Mr. Cobb, are you all right?

676
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,220
- I just bit my tongue, that's all.
- Were any of those women clients?

677
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,530
Uh, here we go.

678
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,770
- No! You're dead meat, Buddy!
- It's Edwina Cutwater's soul in me!

679
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,910
- Oh, that's right blame it all on me!
- It's your fault, I had this case won.

680
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,040
- No, I had it won!
- What the hell's going on here?

681
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,230
- It's all not fair!
- There's no fairness in a court room!

682
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:08,030
- 500 dollars. Contempt of court!
- Good for you, Judge.

683
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,160
- 1,000 dollars!
- Shut up!

684
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,520
- No, you shut up! 1,500!
- Not you, her. I got her inside me.

685
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,500
- Well then, both o'you shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up, Charles!

686
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,890
2.000 dollars and Bail throw
this jackass out of my court!

687
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:28,290
- I am going to the State Bar. Lunatic!
- You can't do this to me!

688
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:32,250
Not just a lunatic, a pervert, too.
He plays with himself!

689
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:36,690
- And he cheated on me with a dead body!
- You're fired, Cobb!

690
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:43,730
Oh, Roger, I see what you mean
about life is to be savoured!

691
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,610
- It's so... dramatic.
- I am going to kill you.

692
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,190
- I was just trying to help.
- You failed!

693
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,000
What happened since you help me?
I've lost my girl, I've lost my job,

694
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,910
I've alienated my dog!
I broke my sunglass.

695
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,740
You can't even get that kind any more.
Stop helping me!

696
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,910
You're so ungrateful. If it weren't
for me you would get that partnership

697
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:15,080
and have to take cases like that!
Kiss your Dad's high ideals goodbye.

698
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:20,270
You'd also be married to Peggy.
You call that savouring life?

699
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:25,910
- Who's talking about savouring life!
- I spent my life in a sick bed.

700
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:29,230
What's your excuse?

701
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,820
You know, it's just like a dead person
to say something like that.

702
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,910
- How much to the airport?
- Uh, 30 bucks.

703
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:47,250
- 100. Pan Am. He has to get his plane.
- It doesn't leave till midnight.

704
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,580
- Make it 200.
- No problem.

705
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,030
- No problem.
- Bon voyage.

706
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,530
Voyage?

707
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,830
- Waste of time. Hurry to the cemetery.
- He better be there, lady!

708
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:05,450
- Maybe Terry picked him up.
- He just better be there!

709
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:09,770
Oh, there's the elevator.
Hurry! Oh, I love running!

710
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:22,790
- Have you seen Prakha?
- I was hoping you had.

711
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:27,980
- He wasn't at the hotel this morning.
- Oh, I'm ruined. God!

712
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,970
What is that? And who are
all those people behind my hearse?

713
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,740
- Oh, I invited them.
- What do you mean?

714
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,920
Last night while you were asleep,
I wanted to surprise you.

715
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:47,730
I thought it might make your funeral
a little more fun. I don't know.

716
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,490
Edwina. Edwina?

717
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,110
You got a little mirror?
Compact or something?

718
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,520
Oh! Oh, Roger, thank you.

719
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,960
Ok. Don't make a big deal out of it,
I just did it because I thought

720
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,120
I liked you. I've gotten
over that since then.

721
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,750
- Now, come on.
- It's all right. I'm ok now.

722
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:29,740
- Really. I'm fine.
- You're ok?

723
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,060
Yes. It's the nicest thing anybody's
ever done for me.

724
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,820
- Don't say that.
- Well, it is...

725
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:45,490
You're best friend I've ever had.

726
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,920
- Thanks.
- Are you all right?

727
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,520
Oh, yeah. The music got to me.

728
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,860
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. Amen.

729
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,160
Amen.

730
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,400
Terry?

731
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,040
I have this terrible feeling we're
never going to see Prakha Lasa again.

732
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,210
- I'll find him. Maybe at the hotel.
- I told you. He's not there.

733
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:36,540
Let's file a Missing Persons report.
Hey, maybe he's trying to get home!

734
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,710
- Let's try the airports.
- Actually, the hotel might be better.

735
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,820
He's bound to turn up there
eventually. We should try there first.

736
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:56,250
- What are you doing?
- We may not have another chance.

737
01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:00,420
- Oh, but I don't think I can...
- Please, Roger, I want to feel

738
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,230
your naked skin next to mine.
I want to feel our bodies merge.

739
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:10,080
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong
with a quick little old merge.

740
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,250
- Oh, no, you don't do that once again!
- Why don't you relax,

741
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,420
- maybe you'll learn something.
- I thought we've to find Prakha Lasa?

742
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,580
- I'm just taking a little breather.
- Well, put your little breather back

743
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,710
- in your trousers and let's find him!
- Roger, what's wrong?

744
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:29,830
- What?
- Don't I excite you?

745
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:34,320
- Edwina, what are you doing?
- I am thinking of very old nuns.

746
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,210
- Oh, please don't do this to me.
- Roger, don't you want me?

747
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:44,480
Oh, God! Now she's thinking of
dead kittens! Would you excuse us?

748
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:52,170
All right! What happened to
"Oh, Roger, you're my best friend!"?

749
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:56,340
I just don't feel like performing
a sexual act on Fred's daughter.

750
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,500
- How about if she performs one on us?
- No!

751
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,620
- Please?
- No! What is so important about sex?

752
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,660
So important about sex? That's like
"What's important about laughing?"

753
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,290
Or Duke Ellington or the World Series?

754
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:16,460
It's one of those things that makes
you feel like you're really living,

755
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,630
- Like you're glad to be alive!
- I am already glad to be alive.

756
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:24,790
I don't need to play 'tonsil hockey'
with some English tart to feel good,

757
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,520
- In fact, I feel quite tingly!
- Yeah! You're feeling my tingles!

758
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:35,530
- What do you mean?
- It's called "sexual excitement".

759
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,290
- It is?
- Yes. If you think this feels good,

760
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:45,520
wait'll you feel what
hot passionate boffing feels like.

761
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:51,150
- And what happens? Bigger tingles?
- Oh, major tingles.

762
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,690
- Will she still respect us tomorrow?
- She doesn't respect us now!

763
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:00,280
- Let's boff!
- Yeah!

764
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:05,090
- This could be sort of embarrassing.
- For who?

765
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:09,080
For me. As soon as I get Terry's body,
you'll know what I look like naked.

766
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:12,750
I swear to God I'll never tell anyone.

767
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,920
- Ok, thank you.
- You're welcome, now shut up.

768
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:21,090
- What should I do? How can I help?
- Fantasize.

769
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,580
- Oh. Ok. I'm good at that.
- Oh, Terry.

770
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,980
- Oh, Roger.
- Oh, Clark. Wait a second, wait!

771
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:35,130
- What are you doing?
- I'm fantasizing.

772
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:39,410
- I see Clark Gable takes his shirt off!
- I know. Isn't this hot?

773
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:44,610
- No! It's cooling me off, you know?
- It's making me tingle like crazy.

774
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,400
Ok. Now just throw a couple o' women
on top of him and we're in business!

775
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:55,030
- Ok.
- All right!

776
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,190
- Is it all right now?
- Sort of. She's got the whole cast

777
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:03,080
of "Gone With The Wind"
humping in my head.

778
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,210
- Oh, Roger.
- Oh, Terry.

779
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,610
Oh, Clark! Vivian and Olivia.

780
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:13,900
Oh, Ashley and Butterfly.

781
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,080
- At last. Oh, no! Son-of-a-bitch!
- Son-of-a-bitch?

782
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:25,290
I don't believe it!
Now where the hell have you been?

783
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:30,440
- Been?
- The airport? What did you there?

784
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:35,650
Prakha, it is now time for Miss
Cutwater's soul to enter Miss Hoskins.

785
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:40,540
- Enter Miss Hoskins!
- It's me, Prakha, I'm inside Roger.

786
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,590
- Nyhm?
- Go warm up the bowl!

787
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:47,110
- Oh!
- Yeah!

788
01:07:55,950 --> 01:08:00,660
Terry? I guess it wasn't meant to be
between us. I'll always regret that.

789
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:05,130
But I want you to know that,
wherever it is you're going,

790
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,550
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- I will. I've got a wonderful house,

791
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:14,050
beautiful horses and all the money in
the world why shouldn't I be happy?

792
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,150
What?

793
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:20,120
If you think I'm really going through
with this you're not just stupid,

794
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:24,040
- you're crazy.
- What? I'll handle this. What?

795
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:28,210
From the beginning I thought if mad
Edwina wants to give her money away,

796
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:32,830
she may as well give it to me. I never
thought that "Flying Nun" could do it.

797
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,000
- Wait! You just can't leave her in me!
- I'd really love to stay and chat

798
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:41,280
darling, but I've got get back
to my mansion, get ready for my party.

799
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,780
Ciao!

800
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:50,960
Oh, by the way, don't bother coming.
The guards will have orders

801
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,910
to keep you out!
Bye, Roger. Goodbye, Miss Cutwater.

802
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,370
So long, Prakha!

803
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:09,230
Please, don't say it.

804
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:14,650
Oh, dear God, all I want
was a second chance, a fair shake!

805
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,330
Instead I've made a complete mess
of your life,

806
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:23,540
and I've left all my money to a...

807
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,450
lying, cheap slut, sex poodle! Oh!

808
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,460
Prakha, I want you to release my soul.
Give Roger his freedom.

809
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,130
No! She double-crossed us,
we can fight this.

810
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:48,400
No. Perhaps Prakha can put my soul
into an eagle or some wonderful bird.

811
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,440
So that I can fly free with the wind.

812
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:58,990
Hover over my house
and shit on her head.

813
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,900
- Stop talking like that.
- I can't help it. I'm pissed!

814
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,840
I became a lawyer because I wanted
to fight injustice. I wanted to help

815
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,420
- the little guy against the big guy.
- Big guy!

816
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,650
Instead I wound up representing
powerful rich people like you.

817
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,710
But now, you see, you're a pauper!
You're bilked out of what's rightfully

818
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:27,160
yours by Miss Terry Hoskins, who is
today one of the wealthiest women

819
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:32,010
in the State of California.
And you wanna be a bird?

820
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:36,130
Forget it!
Don't go soft on me now.

821
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,130
Oh, it's no that. It's just that
offering you your freedom is the first

822
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:43,960
- unselfish thing I've ever done.
- How's it feel?

823
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,630
- Oh, wonderful.
- You're ok, Edwina.

824
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:50,320
Give me the number of the
Fulton Norris orchestra, please.

825
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:23,130
Dad, you don't have to do that.
You're not an employee any more.

826
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:27,130
- Someone's gotta do it.
- I'll hire someone. Pack your things.

827
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:31,300
You're moving up to the house.
No, I won't. It's not right!

828
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,290
Yes, you will. I won't have people
saying my father lives in a stable.

829
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:39,470
I bought you a tuxedo. You're coming
to the party tonight. And take a bath!

830
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:43,840
You know, you're nicer to that horse
than you are to people?

831
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:48,400
- Why don't you take him to your party?
- If it were appropriate to me I would!

832
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,220
- Oh, you're lucky you're a gelding.
- Snap it up, guys. Thank you.

833
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,380
Smile, please. Oh, and if you have
to winkie let's do it now.

834
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:04,410
They have a full rehearsal
in 5 minutes.

835
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,320
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- Come on.

836
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,460
- How you plan on pullin' this off?
- Beats the heck outta me.

837
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,460
Well, if I can be of any help at all,
you in worse trouble than I thought.

838
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,160
That's right.

839
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:32,130
- That's more fun than being a lawyer.
- I know.

840
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:36,040
I think you should forget the law
and become a musician full time.

841
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:40,220
- Oh, it's a nice dream, but I can't.
- There's nothing sadder than

842
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,380
looking back at the end of your life
and saying, "l didn't do it right".

843
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,590
- And believe me, I know.
- Yeah. Oh, my solo's coming up.

844
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:52,790
- Can you give me control of my hand?
- Sure.

845
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,030
I'm sorry again.

846
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,660
- Is this some sort of a joke?
- You didn't like that?

847
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,050
Listen, I'll be ok.
I just need a minute.

848
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,090
- Ok, gentlemen, let's take a break.
- Who are those guys?

849
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:24,290
- Bring the bowl. Come on.
- The bowl.

850
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,490
- You know, your friend's a real freak.
- Thank you.

851
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:35,700
See you in the mornin'.

852
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,910
I'm gonna put on a bloody tuxedo.

853
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,270
Prakha! Now!

854
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:57,170
Good boy.

855
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,360
Oh! Edwina?

856
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,540
Oh!

857
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:14,860
- Ok! Miss Hoskins!
- Hoskins.

858
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,630
Grab that bowl!

859
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:26,780
- Grab that bowl!
- Stop it! Let go!

860
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,870
- Edwina in bowl?
- Edwina.

861
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,690
- Where's Edwina?
- Edwina.

862
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,220
- Edwina in water?
- Edwina.

863
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,990
You just made a big mistake, Buster!
Guards! Guards!

864
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,720
- Put Edwina back in the bowl?
- Back in bowl.

865
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:05,670
- Yes, back in bowl. Yes, back in bowl.
- Back in bowl. Nyhm.

866
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:09,740
Nyhm? Whatta you mean?

867
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,420
- Oh, you have to fix the bowl?
- Fix bowl.

868
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,510
- Fix bowl.
- Fix bowl.

869
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,680
- You put Edwina back in bowl.
- Back in bowl.

870
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:24,240
Edwina back in bowl. Go fix bowl.
Go fix bowl. Go, go, go!

871
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:28,620
Edwina, if you can hear me
blow some bubbles or something.

872
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:32,180
I'm talking to a bucket!

873
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,410
Get that bucket! Get that bucket!
Don't let him get away!

874
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:05,380
- Ty, feel this.
- What is it?

875
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:08,510
- Take good care of it!
- What is it?

876
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:12,710
- It's very, very special.
- No problem.

877
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,950
Hey, where are you going
with that green bucket?

878
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,700
Get out of my way!

879
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:45,130
Oh! Shit!

880
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:57,870
- Oh! Damn!
- It's all right.

881
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,080
No!

882
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,240
- Want us to throw him out, ma'am?
- No, he's harmless.

883
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,830
Goodbye, Edwina.

884
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,930
- Good evening.
- Miss Hoskins?

885
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,970
Mr. Mifflin! Mr. Schuyler.
We have rather a pleasant orchestra.

886
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:42,240
Daddy, how debonaire.

887
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:50,050
Oh, good evening. I'm Terry Hoskins.
Welcome to Hoskins Manor.

888
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:56,530
<i>~ All of me. Why not take all of me. ~</i>

889
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:05,340
<i>~ Can't you see.</i>
<i>I'm not good without... ~</i>

890
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,880
God rest her wonderful soul.
I'll never forget her.

891
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:31,050
Just remember how comforting it'll be
to look around this magnificent home

892
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:35,220
and always see a little bit
of Edwina in everything.

893
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,420
- Yes. Especially the flower bed.
- Yes.

894
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,490
Ty, I thought I had everything
under control.

895
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:54,720
I'm sorry, man. I didn't see her
grab the pitcher.

896
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:59,000
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- It's not your fault, Ty.

897
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:03,260
Oh, man, I feel empty.

898
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,800
You know, I know this sounds crazy,
but I actually miss the old girl.

899
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,510
Who are you calling an old girl?

900
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,710
- It's no funny... Ty!
- I'm not trying to be funny,

901
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,040
- you peasant!
- Edwina?

902
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,850
No, it's Pearl Bailey.
Who the hell do you think it is?

903
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:25,550
- Oh, Edwina!
- Hey, hey, that's my side, stupid!

904
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:29,220
- I'm over here!
- What are you doing in Ty?

905
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,390
- How should I know? I see nothing!
- Man, when you set that pitcher down

906
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:37,560
here and said take care of it,
I thought it was gin and I drank some.

907
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:42,170
- But why didn't you say something?
- I wanted to see if you missed me.

908
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,200
Cute, cute, cute. Oh, God!
Come on, Ty, come on. Come on!

909
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,140
Hey, Bix.

910
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,330
- Prakha?
- Fix bowl.

911
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,180
- Ah, fix bowl. Great.
- Edwina in water?

912
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,630
- Edwina not in water. Say something.
- Your Holiness, it is l,

913
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,720
- Edwina Cutwater.
- Edwina?

914
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:14,930
- Yes.
- I fail to see humor in the situation.

915
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:18,830
He drink her.
Drink her?

916
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,470
- He drink her.
- If it hat not been for Mr. Wattell,

917
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:27,640
I'd be Edwina the Flower Bed
right now, you big dope!

918
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:31,840
- Big dope!
- Look, look! Take Edwina out,

919
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,780
- put back in me.
- In me.

920
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,080
- Ok?
- Ok.

921
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:42,010
- Really?
- It's the only safe place.

922
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:47,240
- Oh, you really are my friend.
- I sure hope nobody else can see this.

923
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,750
Ok.

924
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,040
- Good night. We're in the Roosevelt.
- If you need anything you call Grace.

925
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:06,010
- Good night.
- Good night.

926
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:10,010
- Ty, you gotta get back on the bus.
- Oh, no way, Jose, I gotta find out

927
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,140
- how this megillah ends.
- Ty!

928
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,410
Besides I can be of help. Walkin'
around in the dark is my territory.

929
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:20,600
- Ok, you're hired.
- Thank you.

930
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:25,870
- Oh, God! This way.
- What kind o' seein' eye dog is this?

931
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:31,000
- You hang back here.
- Hang back here.

932
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:50,020
- Hi, Sailor.
- Are you having a good time?

933
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:55,240
Yeah, I am. I hope I have as much fun
in my new body as I've had in yours.

934
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,900
Thanks.

935
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:06,180
- There she is.
- Roger, now that you know what

936
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,660
a horrible person she is, aren't you
glad you weren't intimate with her?

937
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:21,710
- I thank my lucky stars.
- I'm glad you said that.

938
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:26,500
I've been thinking.
If things work out

939
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:31,420
- you just might get another chance.
- Oh, Edwina Cutwater!

940
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,670
That's our cue.

941
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:46,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

942
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,920
Ty, watch your head. Sssh!

943
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:06,340
Come on, Prakha, come on, come on.
Bix, go outside, go on.

944
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,640
- Go on. Prakha, take care o' Ty.
- Ty.

945
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:14,130
- Take care of Ty.
- Ty.

946
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,080
- Sssh! Sssh! Sssh!
- Sssh! Sssh! Sssh!

947
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,750
- Oh!
- Hello, darling!

948
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:52,480
Whatta you waitin' for, grab her!
Watch out! I think she's got a gun.

949
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:56,350
Let's all take a nice little
walk now, shall we?

950
01:23:56,450 --> 01:24:00,060
- Where we goin'?
- Sh, don't wake up the other guests.

951
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,350
- What are you going to do?
- You sneaked back in here to rob me.

952
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:08,680
- Oh, we in trouble, Roger.
- You took the gun from my night table.

953
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:12,850
- Big trouble.
- You led me to a quiet room.

954
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:17,140
- This is what I shall say. Get in here!
- How do you expect to get away?

955
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:21,050
I'll just tell the truth. You brought
me to this room, we struggled,

956
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:25,100
- I grabbed the gun.
- What the hell is going on?

957
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,270
Watch out! Sounds like a gunshot!
Somebody's fighting now, Roger.

958
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:32,760
Somebody just knocked over
some furniture.

959
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,350
Sounds like an end table
with chock keys on it, Roger.

960
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:40,680
It's ok now. It's all over.
Who won?

961
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,810
- We did, Ty.
- I'm calling the police!

962
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,980
- Good idea. Who's that?
- No, don't! I won't go back to jail!

963
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,100
- Back to jail?
- Who's going back to jail?

964
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,060
- Terry? What about all these people?
- Get me the police.

965
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,290
- Police?
- Attempted homicide. 2 counts, maybe.

966
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:04,230
- No, that'll be her third conviction!
- Third conviction?

967
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:08,390
You're a 3 time lost. You'll go into
the slammer. They throw away the key.

968
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:13,180
- I promise I'll kill myself first!
- She would, you know.

969
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,350
Police? Burton Schuyler. I want to
report an attempted homicide!

970
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:21,750
- Yes, I'm over here...
- Stop! Miss Cutwater?

971
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,420
- Yes?
- My body will go to jail, too.

972
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:36,340
- Hang up, Schuyler.
- I'll make a deal with you.

973
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:59,060
- Terry!
- Terry...

974
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,750
- Oh, my Lord, that was powerful.
- Edwina!

975
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,040
Roger!

976
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,710
- It worked. It really worked.
- ls Terry in there, too?

977
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:16,210
She's gone.

978
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,250
Terry?

979
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:33,170
Are you sure this is what you want,
honey bun?

980
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:38,650
Thank you, ma'am. I don't know I will
explain this to her probation officer,

981
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,270
- but thank you.
- That's quite all right, Fred.

982
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:46,460
Come on, baby. I'm gonna fix you
a nice private stable

983
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,100
and never leave Daddy again.

984
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,310
No more thieving, no more swindling
just runnin' and prancin'

985
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:58,960
and jumpin' for the rest of your life.

986
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:46,590
- So, how do you feel?
- Alive and happy...

987
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,170
- and scared.
- Why?

988
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:57,100
Because I finally got
what I always wanted,

989
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:02,380
- and I've no excuses any more.
- Yeah. Welcome to the real world.

990
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,020
- What?
- Tingles.

991
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,600
- I hope you try it more often.
- ls that advice from my lawyer?

992
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,600
- I'm no lawyer. I'm a musician.
- You are?

993
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:21,770
I had more feelings in the last 2 days
than in the last ten years in office!

994
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:27,100
Those papers stacked up to height
and that flourescent lighting burning

995
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,270
off all my vitamins. Unlike you, most
of us only get around once in life,

996
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:35,470
and I'm not going to spend the rest
of my mine sitting behind a desk.

997
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:39,750
- Oh, you talk like a beer commercial.
- Hey, let's dance.

998
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,460
- I don't know how.
- Oh, it's easy.

999
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,680
Now, put your feet on top of mine.
Come on.

1000
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:54,140
This is how kids learn how to dance.
See?

1001
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,000
Try it with your own feet.

1002
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:20,630
<i>~ All of me.</i>
<i>Why not take all of me? ~</i>

1003
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:27,670
<i>~ Can't you see,</i>
<i>I'm no good without you. ~</i>

1004
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,920
<i>~ Take my lips.</i>
<i>I wanna lose them. ~</i>

1005
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:40,680
<i>~ Take my arms.</i>
<i>I'll never use them. ~</i>

1006
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:47,340
<i>~ Your Goodbye</i>

1007
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:54,090
<i>~ Now can l</i>

1008
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:00,470
<i>~ You took the part</i>
<i>that once was my heart. ~</i>

1009
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,020
<i>~ So why not take all of me? ~</i>

1010
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:11,550
<i>~ Why not take all of me? ~</i>

1011
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:17,210
<i>~ Take all of me.</i>
<i>Can't you see. ~</i>

1012
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:22,790
<i>~ I'm no good without you. ~</i>

1013
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:27,420
<i>~ Take my lips.</i>
<i>I wanna loose them. ~</i>

1014
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:33,670
<i>~ And take my arms.</i>
<i>I'll never use them. ~</i>

1015
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,970
<i>~ Your Goodbye</i>
<i>left me with eyes that cry. ~</i>

1016
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:48,250
<i>~ How can l</i>
<i>go on, Dear, without you. ~</i>

1017
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:54,510
<i>~ You took the part</i>
<i>that once was my heart. ~</i>

1018
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,300
<i>~ So why not take all of me? ~</i>
