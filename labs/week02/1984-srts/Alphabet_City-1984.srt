1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,913
I love you.

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,583
You're so beautiful.

3
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,960
- I want you.

4
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Renee.

5
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,647
Want me to get her?

6
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,983
- It's okay. I'll get her.

7
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,825
Renee.

8
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,827
Hi.

9
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,914
Did we wake you up?

10
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,791
Come here. Look at you.

11
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,835
Daddy wants to give you a kiss.

12
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,970
- 20.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
21.

14
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,057
22.

15
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,729
Oh, Renee, help me. 23.

16
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,398
24.

17
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,032
Either you're getting bigger

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,365
or I'm losing it.

19
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,728
I won't be too late.

20
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,731
Yeah? You bet.

21
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,210
Hey, Johnny,
Gino's waiting for you.

22
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,312
- Dumas, what's happening?

23
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,233
- Lippy give me
10 bottles of 357.

24
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,842
- We aim to please
and so does Louise.

25
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:27,905
- Louise?

26
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,574
- See you later Dumas, man.

27
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,704
- See you Friday.

28
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,339
Lippy.

29
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,257
Lippy! Lippy.

30
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,221
- Hello.

31
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,554
- Lippy.

32
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,847
Lippy!

33
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,368
Why aren't you
minding the store?

34
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,744
You're supposed to be
running the night shift!

35
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,768
What are you doing?

36
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,479
- It's cool, baby!

37
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,565
I got some of my finest
employees covering.

38
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,777
I just sold 10 bottles
to that dumb ass honkie.

39
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,487
T-I-N. 10.

40
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,614
- I'm not impressed, honey.

41
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,909
I'm running a volume business,
not a nickel dime side show.

42
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,163
Oh, kiss me, honey.

43
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,002
Damn, look at you,
you're a human mess.

44
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,755
- Alphabet Johnny, so clean now.

45
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,089
You got it all.

46
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,050
What you gonna do,

47
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,220
you gonna pick on this
poor defenseless black-

48
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,991
- Why don't you can the
act, all right, Lip?

49
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,809
All right? Stop being
your own best customer.

50
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,143
- Yeah?

51
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,467
I'll tell you what, man.
- What?

52
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,039
- I only peddle this shit
so I don't gotta pay for it.

53
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,732
- All right? Oh,
my God, can I cry?

54
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,651
Just a few. Let me
squirt a few. All right?

55
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,236
- Give me a fucking cigarette.

56
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,154
Give me a fucking cigarette.
- You want a cigarette?

57
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,687
- Give me a fucking cigarette.

58
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,091
Come on man, don't fuck about.
- In the back. In the back.

59
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:52,699
Man, what do you
think you're doing?

60
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,113
- In the back, in the back.

61
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,872
Come on, in the
back, in the back.

62
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,124
- Put this window down.

63
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,042
-Come on, I got a
pack in the back.

64
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,455
- Something smells in here.

65
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,480
- What do you want? You
want me to light it for you?

66
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,547
- I can light it myself.

67
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,817
You paint these with tranny
helper, or something, man?

68
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,321
- Come on, I have,
I have a big heart.

69
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,862
- I got a big heart, you got
something else that's big.

70
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,155
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?

71
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,459
Come on, I have
to save these for

72
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,474
charity cases like yourself.

73
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,311
Come on, hold it.
Ah, forget about it.

74
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,521
- I can light my own.
I can handle it, man.

75
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,065
- Lippy.

76
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,066
Lippy.

77
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,650
What happened to you, huh?

78
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,195
You used to be pretty
once I remember.

79
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,088
- Look, man...
- I was in love with you.

80
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,395
- I'm gonna tell you something.

81
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,217
We're making more money
than we can count, man.

82
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,284
What do you want from me?

83
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,618
- Hey, goombah, huh!

84
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,121
- Yeah, my butt!

85
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,766
- You and me got this
street by the balls,

86
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,042
we're practically
legends, immortal!

87
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:44,959
Huh?

88
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,333
- Well, why you on my ass?

89
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,005
- Because I want your
ass watching the store.

90
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,509
You know how much those
dudes could be skimming?

91
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,469
- You ought to know. What?

92
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,137
What did you say?

93
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,597
- What's the matter, man?

94
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,599
What's the matter, brother?

95
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,851
You got a salami up
your eye-tie ass?

96
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,482
- I got Gino up my ass.

97
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,694
Oh, is that right?

98
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,489
What does Don Corleone want now?

99
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,201
- This building.

100
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
- Count me out,
John, like you say.

101
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm just a no...

102
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,796
No good fucked up junkie, man.

103
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,590
I hate fire!

104
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,637
Don't go away mad!

105
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,351
- Sophia, you're
too much, honey.

106
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,367
- Hi, Ma.

107
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,495
What're you doing?

108
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,973
- Get away, you're
gonna burn yourself.

109
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,248
- Who is that man?

110
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,459
Give me a hug or what?
- Get away.

111
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,792
What is this?

112
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,380
- How you doing, huh?

113
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,510
What, what? You know I'm lazy.

114
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,763
- Well, I don't like the beard.

115
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,224
Hi, princess.

116
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,642
- How you doing, Johnny?

117
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,809
Whoo!

118
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,564
- So, what's on TV tonight, huh?

119
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,942
Hmm?

120
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,071
Who's that?

121
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:20,948
- A friend.

122
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,825
- Ooh, that's Julio Iglesias.

123
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,494
He's handsome, ain't he?

124
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,329
Whoo!

125
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,121
- Really, what?

126
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,541
- He treat you good, Mama?

127
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,876
- Yeah.

128
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,490
Better than your
father ever did.

129
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,434
- You let him rest in
peace, all right, Ma?

130
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
This guy hit you?

131
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,384
- No.
- This guy hits you,

132
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,094
you tell me-
- Hit?

133
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,553
- And I'll take care of it.

134
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,887
- No!

135
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,444
He just drinks all her
beer and passes out.

136
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,559
- What is... What? What?

137
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:52,938
- Mama.

138
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,064
- What?

139
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,566
- You don't have to
slave for nobody.

140
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,943
- Yeah.

141
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:57,735
- You don't have to
show us what a saint

142
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,528
you are all the time.

143
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,405
- Yeah, we already know.

144
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,864
- What is that? What is that?

145
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,182
You want me to wash
it? Want me to-

146
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,541
- Come on, Ma, just take it.

147
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,874
- I'll wash it.

148
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,171
Get it off, I don't
want that dirty money.

149
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,048
I do honest work.

150
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,807
Will you listen to her?
Will you listen to her?

151
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,780
You gotta do something with
her. You gotta talk to her.

152
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,964
I think she'll listen to you.

153
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,075
Be careful of the iron.
- It's gonna be all right.

154
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,350
It's gonna be all right. Yeah.

155
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,269
- Yeah, it's gonna be terrific.

156
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,122
Every night I think they're
gonna wake me up, ring my bell,

157
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,064
tell me you're dead
in an alley somewhere.

158
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,566
- Oh, Mama.

159
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,026
It's never gonna happen.

160
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,652
Never.
- Yeah.

161
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,130
- We always go through the
same thing, am I right? Huh?

162
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,154
- Yeah.

163
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,845
- I got it under
control. No problem.

164
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,108
- It's got you under control.

165
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,408
- No, it doesn't!

166
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,702
I'm gonna talk to her.

167
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,555
I didn't
do nothing, Johnny.

168
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,179
- 15 years old and
already she's a tramp!

169
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,582
- I'm an escort, Ma. Oh.

170
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,019
- You're an escort.
What is that?

171
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,462
Is that the uptown
name for a whore, huh?

172
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,941
When you sell your ass for
Alphabet City, you're a whore.

173
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,383
Okay?
- Oh, Johnny.

174
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,635
Johnny, I don't sell my ass.

175
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,722
They pay me for the
privilege of my company.

176
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,074
I don't even have
to come across.

177
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,858
It's a goddamn joke,
I'm telling you, Johnny.

178
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,478
- It's not a joke.
You know that.

179
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,811
- Yeah?
- It's no joke.

180
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,423
- Well listen to
this, big brother.

181
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,647
A limo. Uh-huh.

182
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,984
A limo is coming to
take me to Park Avenue.

183
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,652
Some big doctor or a lawyer.

184
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,986
Johnny, look at me.

185
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,282
I ain't gonna end up like Mama,

186
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,077
having those old bums lying
around me in my old age.

187
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,661
- You shut up your mouth!

188
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,235
You don't ever talk about Mama
like that. You understand?

189
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,709
- Johnny, Johnny, I didn't
mean nothing against Mama.

190
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,961
It's just that I don't
like all those dead beats

191
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,214
trying to catch me in
my underwear, you know?

192
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,801
- What? What?

193
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,214
What are you, Miss Bashful,
now all of a sudden, huh?

194
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,638
- Maybe.

195
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,682
- Look at yourself,
Sophia, look at yourself.

196
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,016
- What's wrong, huh?

197
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,686
- You're giving them
plenty of chances, babe.

198
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,188
Hmm?

199
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,999
Now, let me tell you
something. Let me tell you.

200
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,733
When you get sick,

201
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,379
and you can't work, what do
you think is gonna happen, huh?

202
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,654
- Sick?

203
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,673
- You know what? You ask those
other chicks what happens.

204
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,533
Ask them.
- Johnny. Johnny.

205
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,413
I ain't like those wasted
broads that work for Gino.

206
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,915
I go uptown, strictly uptown.

207
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,253
- How do you think those
wasted broads started out?

208
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,586
Huh?

209
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,006
They was just like you, Sophia.

210
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,425
They was thinking they're
special. They're special.

211
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,805
They're gonna live some good
life, humping the uptown trade.

212
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,724
But you know something?
They're all down here now.

213
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,058
All of them.

214
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,686
Working for a goddamn pimp

215
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,771
and none of them
was ever special.

216
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,275
Is that what you want?

217
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,821
Oh, baby, you're
gonna have the best.

218
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,155
I guarantee it.

219
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,022
But you ain't gonna get it
the way you're going about it.

220
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,663
Now, listen to me.

221
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,334
You and Mama gotta get out
of the building tonight.

222
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,546
They're gonna torch it.

223
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,160
- Who's gonna
torch the building?

224
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,381
- It don't matter who.

225
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,593
You don't wanna know.

226
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,387
It's economics, you know, the...

227
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,282
The real estate, property
values, etcetera.

228
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,849
Somebody wants to
make a killing.

229
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,368
And they don't care
if they have to Kill

230
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,392
a few people to do it.

231
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,563
You and Mama just gotta get out.

232
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,815
- Why can't you stop 'em, huh?

233
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,567
- I can't stop them.

234
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,819
- Wait, wait, Johnny.

235
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,656
I thought you were
their golden boy.

236
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,825
Big man on his way up.

237
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,785
Big man on the streets.

238
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,414
Alphabet Johnny.

239
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,461
Why can't you stop them, huh?

240
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,756
-'Cause I'm the man
with the matches.

241
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,552
- You?

242
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,346
You're gonna do it?

243
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,264
And you can't say no, huh?

244
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,057
- Sophia.

245
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,517
Suppose I say no?

246
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,769
- Yeah?
- It's still gonna go.

247
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,813
All I can do is get you
and Mama out of here.

248
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,670
- What the fuck you
want from me, huh?

249
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,775
I got a date.

250
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,112
This is your problem,
big brother, you hear me?

251
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,446
It's yours.

252
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,828
Maria? Maria!

253
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,957
Maria, come into the house now.

254
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,833
Don't talk back to me.

255
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,252
- Bye, Ma.

256
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,419
Bye, Johnny.

257
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,306
- I'm not going anywhere.

258
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,726
- Mama.

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,895
What do you mean you're
not going anywhere?

260
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,855
You don't go, you die.

261
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,524
- I'd rather die.

262
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,901
- For Christ's sake, Mama.

263
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,196
I mean, what... I buy you
any kind of place you want.

264
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,198
Anything. Huh?

265
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,034
We can all get away
from this goddamn hell.

266
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,870
Ma. Ma.

267
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,664
Do it for me. All right?

268
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,000
Do it for me. Okay?

269
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,085
Come on, why you
wanna stay here?

270
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,731
- 'Cause it's my life and
I don't want to hand it out

271
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,090
to a bunch of cheap hoods.

272
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,051
You scared?

273
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,888
Tough guy.

274
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,182
Tough guy.

275
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,310
Not me!

276
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,105
I don't scare so easy.

277
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,026
They want me out of here,
they can carry me out.

278
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,152
You like that?

279
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,157
Maybe you don't understand that.

280
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,200
Maybe it's time you did.

281
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,952
- Johnny?
- Sophia. Get out of the car.

282
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,369
- Johnny, what the fuck
are you doing here?

283
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,393
Get out of here!

284
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,478
Get out of here, Johnny!

285
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,249
I swear to God...
- Get out of the car.

286
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,983
- Hey, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

287
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,694
You stupid
fuck, what are you doing?

288
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,028
No, Johnny!

289
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,741
Oh, my God. Johnny,
he has a gun.

290
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,788
- Hey, hey. You wanna live?

291
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,789
Huh?

292
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,208
Get in your car and take off.

293
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,420
- You are crazy!

294
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,924
No!

295
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:35,925
No!

296
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,302
You made me lose my job, Johnny.

297
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,636
I hate you!

298
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,392
Will you get away from
me? You're hurting me!

299
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,475
Good boy, Johnny.

300
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,648
Johnny, what
are you doing out here?

301
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,608
- Stop it, Johnny,
please, stop it.

302
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,955
Johnny, I'm really
getting angry!

303
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,288
Johnny!

304
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,087
Shut your mouth,
or I'll come downstairs

305
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,544
and shut it for you.

306
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,296
- Well, fuck you, dildo brain!

307
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,135
Why are you doing
this to me, huh?

308
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,846
No, why you doing this to me?

309
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,556
You make me lose my job,

310
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,434
you make me look like shit
in front of my friends.

311
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,102
- Shh. Shh.

312
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,105
- Why you doing this
to me, Johnny, huh?

313
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,091
- I ain't trying to
screw you up, Kid.

314
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,030
Believe me.

315
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,866
Please.

316
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,245
Someday...

317
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,629
But now, tonight...

318
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,859
Tonight, you gotta
get Mama out of here.

319
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
Okay?

320
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,346
She won't listen to me,
she only listens to you.

321
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
All right?

322
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,933
- You're gonna do it?

323
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,435
- No.

324
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,189
No.

325
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,565
No.

326
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,028
They're gonna do it anyway.

327
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,361
Do you understand?

328
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,448
They're gonna do it anyway.

329
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,075
Now, listen to me.

330
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,871
I want you to take this.

331
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,789
All right?

332
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,210
You guys get whatever you need.

333
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,672
You get Mama and get a cab.

334
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,842
Go... Go uptown, some place nice.

335
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,552
A Holiday Inn, whatever,

336
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,013
and you stay there
until you hear from me.

337
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,347
Okay?

338
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,892
- What about you, Johnny?

339
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,506
They're gonna come
after you now.

340
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,979
- You don't worry about me, kid?

341
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,313
Okay?

342
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,898
All right?

343
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,864
You're such a good kid.

344
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,162
I gotta go.

345
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,041
All right?
- Yeah.

346
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,375
- A cab, okay?

347
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,543
- Okay.

348
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,711
- Okay.

349
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,134
- Johnny.

350
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,698
Hey, macho man.

351
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,951
- Look, you stay
away from my sister.

352
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,482
- Que pasa, man?

353
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,810
I been looking heavy for you.

354
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,153
- Guess I found you first.

355
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,408
- Oh, man, what
is this shit, huh?

356
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,828
Yeah. Yeah.

357
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,789
So, how's business, huh?

358
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,584
You getting that good dough?

359
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,044
Those hot ladies?

360
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,420
Those tight little boys?

361
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,215
- What the fuck do you want?
- Yo, man, I want it all.

362
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,709
I want me a fucking Mercedes-Benz,
man, you understand?

363
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,930
A Rolls with a turbo
diesel on that shit.

364
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,641
And I want me a gun, too.

365
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,974
You got a gun.

366
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,268
- Areal gun, man.

367
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,772
I'm talking one of those
imported .45s, man.

368
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,067
You know, the kind that
that foreign faggot makes.

369
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,485
Gold plated.

370
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,196
You know what else I want, man?

371
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,740
I want the territory, man.

372
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,493
I want Alphabet City!

373
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,291
But first I gotta
talk some business

374
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,625
with you, man, you know.

375
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,729
- What the fuck
do you wanna talk?

376
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,505
- Well, I was thinking, uh...

377
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,256
Sophia.

378
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,927
I said she could be looking
real fresh, man, you know.

379
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,888
And, uh, I want her
for my stable, man.

380
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,062
Yo, man.

381
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,189
Slow down, man!

382
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Slow, man!

383
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,242
My God!

384
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,123
Damn.

385
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,920
- You better do
some talking to Oz

386
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,422
about a fucking brain, Juani,

387
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,050
'cause you ain't smart
enough to run this city.

388
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,469
You talk too much,

389
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,179
you scare too fucking easy.

390
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,348
You're nobody.

391
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,933
Nobody. Small time.

392
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
You couldn't run
fucking Disneyland.

393
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,439
Now, get out of my car.

394
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,815
- Oh, yeah?
- Get out.

395
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,067
- Yeah, well, what
about Sophia, huh?

396
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,527
What about Sophia?

397
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,363
- What about Sophia?

398
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,781
What about her?

399
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,034
Come on, Juani.
Just ask me again.

400
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,387
You know I could blow your
fucking brains out

401
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,996
all over the fucking street.

402
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,125
But I don't wanna... I
don't wanna mess up my car.

403
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,798
You get out of my sight!

404
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,092
And don't let me see you
on my fucking streets!

405
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,433
- Yeah, I was just fucking
with you, man, you know.

406
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,228
Hey, well fuck you, man!

407
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Who is it?

408
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,149
- Chunga.

409
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,090
- Hey, Johnny.

410
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,305
- Ramon.
- Hola.

411
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,475
Rock steady.

412
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,814
Johnny.

413
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,609
Thy kingdom

414
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,403
is heaven.

415
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,214
Keep to the right.

416
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,841
The right, god damn it.

417
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,843
Move, move, walk, walk.

418
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,848
Against the wall,
against the wall!

419
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,517
Fucking idiots!

420
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,144
And no talking!

421
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,478
You talk, you walk!

422
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,563
Where you going?

423
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,191
- Uh, inside.
- What for?

424
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,235
Junk. D.
- Universal.

425
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,195
Let me see the tracks.

426
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,786
Now, get your ass up there.

427
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,119
Move, bastard, move.

428
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,539
Oh, man, I'm
gonna be sick, man.

429
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:15,545
Where do you
think you're going?

430
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,145
- You talk, you walk!

431
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,563
- He got my money, man.

432
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,897
- Chunga.

433
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,316
Go get your stuff.

434
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,949
- Get your money ready.

435
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,325
Pay and get out!

436
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,537
I don't want to hear
a sound, not a sound!

437
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,431
- Yo, what is it, man?

438
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,266
- What is the total?
- 11 grams.

439
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,020
- What is the total?

440
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,815
- 20 thou, man. 20 thou.

441
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,941
- Not bad.

442
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,446
- That's two bundles, all right?

443
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,838
It's the
fuzz! Everybody out!

444
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,600
Nobody move!

445
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,606
Evening, Ociffer.

446
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,070
- Get all of it!

447
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,951
Come on!

448
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
- Come on.

449
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,058
A good
night's work, right?

450
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,594
- Everything is a big
fucking show to you.

451
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,927
Big show.

452
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,061
One day no show.

453
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,926
It's gonna be you
and me brother.

454
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,392
- What you talking about, man?

455
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,488
Don't matter how
close they get, man.

456
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,821
We're too fast,

457
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,074
too slick.

458
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,493
Shit.

459
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,287
Sounds like you're losing
your nerve, or something.

460
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,122
- I ain't losing my nerve,

461
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,749
but you're so high all the time,

462
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,543
you couldn't be scared if
your life depended on it.

463
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,589
- Hey, babe.

464
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,591
I can dig it, man. It's cool.

465
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,970
I assume it's gonna
start getting you, man.

466
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,598
But that don't leave you
to tell me my business.

467
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,478
- Your business, Mr. Fucking
Bright Boy, is my business.

468
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,063
You understand?

469
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,024
You don't take care of
you, they get to me.

470
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:46,942
You hurt my arm.

471
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,276
Like dominoes.

472
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,571
Look at you. Lippy!

473
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,406
Look at yourself.

474
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,867
You think I can be
dependent on you anymore?

475
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:56,785
Huh?

476
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,370
No way, man.

477
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,955
It's gone.

478
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,288
You don't got it.

479
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,001
You couldn't tell one of those
cops from a fucking doorman.

480
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,508
- Have I ever let you down?

481
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,601
Tell me the truth, have
I ever fucked you up?

482
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,042
- No, you never fucked...
- Huh?

483
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,804
- You never fucked me up, no!

484
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,137
- Fuck then.

485
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,307
Lippy,
you gotta kick.

486
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,602
You gotta kick for you.

487
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:23,936
You understand? Hear me.

488
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,524
Now, I know you're your own man.

489
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,986
But I ain't gonna stand by
and watch you kill yourself.

490
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,321
Lippy.

491
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,907
Listen to me.

492
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,241
We've been real lucky.

493
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,786
But times change.

494
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,124
Times change.

495
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,424
This whole fucking
scene's catching up on me.

496
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,386
It ain't that I can't
hack it anymore.

497
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,847
I don't wanna hack it anymore.

498
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,939
- No way out for us, man.

499
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,692
No way.

500
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,026
No way.

501
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,070
Only way out for me is in a box.

502
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,659
You find a way out of here.

503
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,412
You find a way out, ain't
nothing I wouldn't do to help you.

504
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,746
You know that, man.

505
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,543
Just don't tell me about...

506
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:29,877
Don't tell...

507
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,963
Don't tell me
nothing about junk.

508
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,757
That's my business!

509
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,271
- I got a feeling about tonight.

510
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,814
I got a feeling.

511
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,579
Get the fuck out.

512
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,734
Eddie, got him outside?

513
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:17,758
You got him?

514
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,691
- Gino.

515
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,024
- Hey, Johnny boy.

516
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,009
What's the matter?
You got a problem?

517
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,279
- No problem.

518
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,617
- The building, Johnny
boy, the building.

519
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,751
What happened, you lose
your matches, or what?

520
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,331
- There was trouble. Trouble
at the store, another bust.

521
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,833
You know, I haven't...

522
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,626
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I know, John.

523
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,128
How much, John?

524
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,630
- Uh, $15,000.

525
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,299
- 1572

526
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,010
Come on, John, don't give me
that shit. That's too low.

527
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,679
- There was a bust. I gotta
take care of my people.

528
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,890
- Hey, hey, fuck the bust, huh?

529
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,223
Listen to me, Johnny.

530
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,950
Don't go talking to
me about your people.

531
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,354
Maybe you forgot
who your people are.

532
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,817
And that building's
priority number one tonight.

533
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,694
Numero uno, capisce?

534
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,029
- Yeah, okay.

535
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,132
- They got all this faith
in you, you know why?

536
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,657
I'll tell you why, John.

537
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,991
Because of me.

538
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,036
So, don't go fucking up.

539
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,538
Okay.

540
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,333
- All right, now listen.

541
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,666
I'm waiting,

542
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,087
but not too much longer,
so get your shit together.

543
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:20,923
I'll talk to you.

544
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,676
- Fuck you!

545
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,271
Get Ready to Break,
Ready to Break

546
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,724
- Yipee, Johnny.

547
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,517
I know what you want.

548
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,316
- Benny.

549
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,070
Benny!

550
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,082
- Payday! Fine!

551
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,086
Sayonara.

552
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,924
- Benny!

553
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,259
Too low.

554
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,932
- Oh. I got.

555
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,939
I got it right here for you.

556
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,239
- Good boy.

557
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,290
Come on.

558
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,418
Come on.

559
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,912
- Oh, bambino, how you doing?

560
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,914
Have a drink. What drink?

561
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,328
I said to give him a drink.

562
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,000
- No, no, it's all right, honey.

563
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,752
- Don't give him a drink.

564
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,605
- Look, Tony...
- Wanna feed your face?

565
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,048
- No, no, no. It's all
right, it's all right.

566
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,424
- You wanna do her?

567
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,843
- No, no. Look, Tony,
I'm late, all right?

568
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,219
- For what?

569
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,138
Smokey the Bear over here.

570
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,347
So, where's the fire?

571
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,642
A drink, please.

572
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,245
- Tony, I just wanna
make my collection

573
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,812
and get out of here, all right?

574
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,690
- Ooh! Relax!

575
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,769
What do you wanna do, give
me a heart attack over here?

576
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,947
Come on. It'll be
a little while.

577
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,158
How long
is a little while?

578
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,204
- I don't know, a
while, that's all.

579
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,165
- Look, Tony, I ain't got
time to hang out, all right?

580
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm running late. Real late.

581
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,046
- Maron.

582
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,965
Come on, you gonna
give me agita.

583
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,218
Bulls made a stop here
about an hour ago,

584
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,346
so, we have a cash-flow
problem tonight.

585
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,266
Unexpected problems of a
legitimate business operation.

586
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,771
- How long?

587
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,107
- Hmm?
- How long?

588
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,192
Tony, how long
till I can collect?

589
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,568
- Oh, shit,

590
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,487
about an hour or
two, that's all.

591
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,198
Listen,

592
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,692
go down to Vinnie's Clam Bar,

593
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,511
get some shrimp balls, and
have 'em put it on my check...

594
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,775
- I ain't fucking hungry, Tony.

595
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,869
- All right.

596
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,293
Why don't you go and take
a long hike for yourself?

597
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,230
Get a couple of sticks
and rub 'em together

598
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,255
like a good scout, huh?

599
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,845
- How come you know so much?

600
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,640
- Come on, give me a break.

601
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,769
Huh? La famiglia.

602
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,104
La famiglia.

603
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,231
We all gotta stick up
for our own, don't we?

604
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,613
You wanna get your
pipe cleaned, or what?

605
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:18,948
- One hour, Tony. One.

606
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,449
- One hour.

607
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,040
- Well, excuse us, tough guy.

608
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,459
- Who do you think you are?

609
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,113
- Gino.

610
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,531
- Why you stalling, Johnny?

611
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,241
- Stalling?
- Look.

612
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,660
The only smoke I see up here
is coming from my cigar.

613
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,205
- There's heat. Cops
all over the place.

614
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,618
- No more than usual, John.

615
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,352
What are you doing
at the club, anyway?

616
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,626
- Business.

617
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,672
- You're making your collections
real fast tonight, Johnny.

618
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,006
You going somewhere?

619
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,593
- Just taking care of business.

620
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,096
- You fucking punk. I've been
saving your ass all along.

621
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,974
Now, you got sticky fingers,
you know that? But no more.

622
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,812
I want you to get
your ass up here.

623
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,874
'Cause you and me are gonna
have a little sit down.

624
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,358
We got things to talk about.

625
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,444
Now, you remember when
I gave you that rock.

626
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,279
I told ya,

627
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,613
we was married now.

628
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,534
And there's no divorce
in our family, Johnny.

629
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,828
There's only one
way out of this.

630
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,372
Hear what I'm saying, John?

631
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,458
Remember one thing, Johnny.

632
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,128
Nobody's fucking indispersable.

633
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,297
You know what I mean?

634
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,770
- Hello?

635
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,817
Johnny.

636
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,236
I'm tired.

637
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,826
Um, can you pick up
some disposable diapers?

638
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,292
Thanks. Bye.

639
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,964
- Why you working so late, huh?

640
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,647
Baby's asleep.

641
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:02,981
The phone's quiet.

642
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,153
Suddenly, I found
myself all alone again.

643
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:21,833
What's the matter?

644
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,799
- Nothing. Nothing.

645
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,439
- Hey! You'll wake the baby.

646
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,775
- Angela.

647
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,571
Um...

648
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,830
We got to get out
of here for a while.

649
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,625
- What do you mean?

650
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:04,751
Who? You?

651
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,670
- Yeah.

652
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,714
Me.

653
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,716
And you.

654
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,222
And Renee. All of us.

655
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,599
- When?

656
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,393
- Tonight.

657
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,273
It's just for a little while.

658
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,607
- Tonight, huh?

659
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,829
You're crazy.

660
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,543
I'm not going anywhere tonight,

661
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,876
except back to bed.

662
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,421
Hopefully, with you.

663
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,723
- Angel.

664
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:09,191
I'm in trouble.

665
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:10,942
- What kind of trouble?

666
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,910
God damn it, talk to
me! What's going on?

667
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,207
- My boss...

668
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:29,711
I have...

669
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,671
I have to...

670
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,881
Gino

671
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,261
wants me to burn
down a building.

672
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:42,724
Mama's building.

673
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,685
- Oh.

674
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,061
Oh.

675
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,395
Great.

676
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,857
Daddy's a fire bug now!

677
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,155
You once promised me
you wanted to change.

678
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,699
Build a family, accept
some responsibility.

679
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,118
Johnny, when are you
finally gonna change?

680
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,457
- Tonight.

681
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,790
Tonight.

682
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,297
Angela.

683
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,800
Angela.

684
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,719
It's just for a couple of days.

685
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,013
A couple of days, I can
straighten everything out.

686
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,600
Look, I've told you before,

687
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,562
I don't want any more
of this life of yours.

688
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,774
It stinks.

689
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,742
You come into my apartment,

690
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,076
our home,

691
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,789
dragging all kinds of shit
out of the gutters with you.

692
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,796
And you expect me to drop
everything like that?

693
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,883
Angie, you've got to trust me.

694
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,751
You know I wouldn't let anything
happen to you and the baby.

695
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,296
I love you too much.

696
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,010
And you love me too.

697
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:48,975
- Yeah?

698
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:50,639
Johnny, we're not
going with you.

699
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:02,150
I don't think you really know
what you're asking of me.

700
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,239
Yeah, I do.

701
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,161
I didn't plan it
this way, Angela.

702
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,495
- I know.

703
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,918
I guess I...

704
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,045
I guess I wanted you
to be someone else.

705
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,258
- Oh, yeah?

706
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,345
Who'd you want me to be?

707
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,514
The president?

708
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,560
I'm gonna be president.

709
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,438
President Johnny.

710
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,149
Want to live in the White House?

711
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,985
Want to do it on
the great lawn, huh?

712
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,490
I ain't never been anybody else.

713
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,617
Never.

714
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,121
I've always been
straight with you.

715
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,083
No lies, no
bullshit. No secrets.

716
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,211
Just me, Johnny.

717
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,050
Now you don't want me.

718
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,430
Maybe this is it.

719
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,437
Maybe this is the last chance
I get to be somebody else.

720
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,568
- Johnny, I love you.

721
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,405
But we're not going.

722
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,720
- I'll be back.

723
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,578
What's going on?

724
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:30,756
- Some junkie.

725
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,635
She OD'd in the bathroom.

726
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,012
- Tony still here?
- Yeah.

727
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,345
But he's busy.

728
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,117
Shit!

729
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,163
Look what you made me do.

730
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,125
- Yes.

731
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,547
Mm-hmm.

732
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,258
Yeah, sure.

733
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,262
Mm-hmm.

734
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,141
It'll be done.

735
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,475
Mm-hmm.

736
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,520
Some business just came up.

737
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,482
Uh-huh. You got it.

738
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,422
I'll get back to you
later, all right?

739
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:33,611
Okay. Bye.

740
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,364
- Tony, I'll just take my money,

741
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,576
then you can get
back to your, er...

742
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,037
- Listen, kid, you
should learn to knock.

743
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,040
- Tony, I ain't waiting no more.

744
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,128
Uh... Karen.

745
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:51,922
Karen, do me a favor.

746
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,551
Um...

747
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,930
Do me a favor, please.
- Mm-hmm.

748
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,183
- Pick up the shit.

749
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,144
And meet me in the bar in a
couple of minutes, all right?

750
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,040
I just have some
personal business

751
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,104
with this gentleman, okay?

752
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,315
Okay. Okay?

753
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,697
- Present for Karen?

754
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,256
- Tony, the money, all right?

755
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,174
- Lock the door,
will ya, Johnny boy?

756
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:20,218
- Come on, Tony, don't break
my balls, all right? Hurry up.

757
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:21,832
- Relax, relax. I'm counting it.

758
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:34,774
Motherfucker!

759
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:46,036
Shut up!

760
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,787
Ciao, Tony, you slithering fuck!

761
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,104
I was fucking set up, and
I saw it coming all night.

762
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,260
I When you're out of sight

763
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:36,223
There we go.

764
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,316
Get out. Out. Get out!

765
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,650
Out, come on.

766
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,447
Come on, out. Get away.

767
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,258
Get yourself some cheese.

768
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:11,885
Knock yourself out.

769
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,010
- Shit!

770
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,570
Oh, shit!

771
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,452
Motherfucker!

772
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:35,926
John...

773
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,871
- I'm gonna Kill you.
- Johnny, man.

774
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,338
Your mother and sister got out.

775
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,725
- You fucking rat!

776
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,621
You son of a bitch!

777
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:05,873
- Motherfucker!

778
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,880
- What the fuck are you doing?

779
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:51,854
Lippy...

780
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,315
- Gino put the word out,
man, the word is you're dead.

781
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,110
- Lippy,

782
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,945
I'm going away, for good.

783
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:00,946
- Good idea.
- For good.

784
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,658
I need a car, a truck,

785
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,868
anything that moves fast. Okay?

786
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,705
- You got it, brother.

787
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,623
- Bring it to my house, please.

788
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,625
Wait a second, wait a minute.

789
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,669
You never invited
me over for dinner.

790
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,963
18 Great Jones Street.
Hurry up, please.

791
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,671
- Go careful, brother, you
ain't so popular no more.

792
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,844
- Hey, brother,

793
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,595
I ain't dead yet.

794
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:32,811
Oh, shit.

795
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,734
Gino.

796
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,879
- Freeze!
- Goddamn!

797
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,799
Jesus Christ, Johnny, what
the fuck are you doing?

798
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,134
Damn!

799
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,636
Hey, sweetheart.

800
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,347
You could've hurt us.

801
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,760
- I thought they were here.

802
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,015
- Who?

803
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,104
Gino?

804
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,438
- Yeah.

805
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:04,986
I'm sorry.

806
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,616
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

807
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,494
Are you okay? God!

808
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:12,829
You look like hell.

809
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,436
What happened to you?

810
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,498
Oh, God! Johnny.

811
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,379
Let's get you washed up, okay?

812
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,436
Honey.

813
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:46,528
What's this?

814
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,239
- It's our future.

815
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Go ahead, open it.

816
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,940
- Is this why we have
to get out of here?

817
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,176
Is this what they want?
- No.

818
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,136
They want me.

819
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,431
- Johnny, I'm scared.

820
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,976
For God's sake, let's
get out of here, now.

821
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,310
- Not yet.

822
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,690
My friend Lippy is
bringing a car, okay.

823
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,442
- You've got a car.
- No, no more.

824
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,987
We'll take a fucking
taxi, anything. Angela...

825
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,572
- Johnny, the baby.

826
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,663
- Go get her.

827
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,290
Angela, go get her.

828
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,510
Angie, we're going
out the back way.

829
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,197
- Why?
- Go! Back way.

830
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,284
Come on.

831
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:19,997
Hold on, hold on.

832
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,750
Go! Come on!

833
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:33,010
- Sal, you stay down
here with the elevators.

834
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,429
I'll take the stairs.
- Okay, chief.

835
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,027
- You got a key to this thing?
- Oh, God!

836
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:50,987
- Do ya?
- Yeah.

837
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,155
Get it, come on.

838
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,825
Here, I'll get it.

839
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,795
- Small key, Johnny, small key.

840
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,465
Come on, sweetie.

841
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,114
Johnny, what're we gonna do?

842
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,241
Hug the baby.

843
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,900
Fuck!

844
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,233
Oh, God!

845
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,697
Johnny, Johnny,

846
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,366
we got to keep moving,
we got to keep moving.

847
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,700
- Where?

848
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,112
Oh, my God, Johnny!

849
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,326
Come on,
come on, go ahead!

850
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:04,870
Kill me, you fuck!

851
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,333
No more fun, capisce?

852
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,667
Come on!

853
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,007
Come on!

854
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:20,427
Come on, you fuck!
What are you gonna do?

855
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,184
Oh, my God!

856
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,562
Chief!

857
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,646
Chief!

858
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,490
Hey, come on, man.

859
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,327
- Get down, get down.

860
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,093
It's okay.

861
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:05,055
It's okay, it's over.

862
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,389
It's over.

863
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,352
It's over, okay?

864
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:14,773
- Let's get out of here.

865
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,571
Let's go.

866
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,994
I got her.

867
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,848
Gino.

868
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:32,393
- You going somewhere, John?

869
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,880
You know, I always
liked you, kid.

870
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,523
You come from the
streets, like me.

871
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:42,152
I tried to get you out of that
sewer, and you've ruined it.

872
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,486
Just you.

873
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,907
But you didn't do the
right thing, John.

874
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,077
- Hey, Gino, not my family.

875
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:51,495
Not them. Me.

876
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:54,415
Nobody walks away.

877
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,251
Nobody.

878
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,839
Not even you, John.

879
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,600
Lippy!
Lippy, you okay?

880
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,149
One hell of a ride.

881
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,735
- I love you, brother. Come on.

882
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:33,412
Gino, baby, you
got my mailing address?

883
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:36,332
Send me a postcard
from hell, man.

884
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,053
<i>Al in a day's work.</i>

885
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,361
Hey, Johnny.

886
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,281
What's up, man?

887
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,795
Let's go, Angie.

888
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:31,053
Peace, brother.

889
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,192
I When you're out of sight
