00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:52,411
Hi, Angel.

2
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,560
Hi.

3
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:58,468
- Rise is freaky.
- Jennifer!

4
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,211
Come here.
- Molly!

5
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,591
3:30.

6
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,085
Don't yell at me!

7
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,460
- I just...
- Now that's trash.

8
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:09,821
Well,
that's not my fault!

9
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,805
You're not the one studying.

10
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,934
Jennifer, come here!

11
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:16,603
Hey Sally, do you
wanna have lunch together?

12
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,414
Oh, so
I'm stuck with you,

13
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:19,565
there he goes!

14
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:22,568
- What's doing?
- Sh, don't say anything.

15
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,295
Your homework assignment

16
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,446
tonight, ah, ah, ah, please,

17
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,533
is to read and digest

18
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,914
the first act of "King Lear".

19
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:37,490
Mr. Shakespeare thanks
you and I thank you.

20
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,470
Um, Molly.

21
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,092
Yeah.

22
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:55,904
Hi, um, I was wondering, well,

23
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,646
I, I, I thought that maybe um,

24
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,608
oh, my name's Wayne.

25
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,816
I know.

26
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:02,817
Oh, you know.

27
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:07,740
Oh, well, I, I, I
thought maybe, um,

28
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,826
maybe you'd like to go
to a movie or something.

29
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,241
Thanks for asking, Wayne,

30
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,905
but my mom thinks I'm
too young to date.

31
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,960
Oh, okay, I understand.

32
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:22,589
Um, thanks anyway,
uh, maybe next time.

33
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:24,506
Maybe.

Well, sweet thing.

00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:52,609
Angel.

89
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,185
Well, Angel.

90
00:07:55,713 --> 00:08:00,593
I thought you and me could
have us a little party, huh?

91
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:03,278
I bet you would.

92
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:06,943
Look mister, I'm underage.

93
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,385
Or are you one of those perverts

94
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,356
that gets off on little girls?

95
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:13,748
We're a little
touchy, aren't we?

96
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,060
Look, why don't you just
drop me off on that corner?

97
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:17,239
I see a friend over there.

98
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:22,841
Look, I didn't do anything.

99
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,626
Thanks for the ride, officer.

100
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,337
What makes you think
I'm a cop, honey?

101
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,270
If you're not a cop, then
what are you doing with this?

102
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,599
Here, call the station.

103
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,570
Angel!

104
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,402
What, goddamn freaks!

105
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:46,699
Happening to this neighborhood?

106
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,308
I hate those, sweetheart,

107
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,639
don't let fatso go yet.

108
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:56,165
Why don't you go home now and
spank your monkey, numbnuts?

109
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,847
Sweetheart, I thought
they busted you.

110
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,107
I had porky made out the
minute I got in the car.

111
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:01,916
Good.

112
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,275
Didn't I
have the best teacher?

113
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,653
You better believe it!

114
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,738
Come on, let's get
another ice cream cone.

115
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,419
Ah keep going, here we go.

116
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,591
Wait.

117
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,496
This is your correct
address, both of you?

118
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,002
- Yeah.
- That's right.

119
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:24,871
Okay I'll give you
a break this time,

120
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,698
but don't let me catch you
working the boulevard again.

121
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:28,812
Thanks.

122
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:32,274
Hey.

123
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,882
Aha, lieutenant!

124
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,214
What do you say, Collins?

125
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,312
Looking good!

126
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,817
Hey it's good to
have you back, man.

127
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,232
See they're keeping
you busy, huh?

128
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,056
Yeah, you'd think with
a psycho on the loose

129
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:44,569
these girls would
stay off the streets.

130
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:47,106
Collins, nothing
stops the action.

131
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,656
If a tidal wave hit this street,

132
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,989
the hookers would bob up
like a bunch of corks.

133
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,603
You got that
right, lieutenant.

134
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:55,937
Guess you're investigating
the hooker murders, huh?

135
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,534
The way he chopped
up those girls?

136
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,318
This guy is one
sick son of a bitch.

137
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:04,609
What I can't understand is,
what makes that sleazebag tick?

138
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:06,851
Well?

139
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:10,487
Figure he was dumped by his
old man when he was a kid,

140
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,138
his mother probably
sexually abused him.

141
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,710
We know he's a necro, probably
bisexual, possibly impotent.

142
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:17,878
My guess is he
wants to get busted.

143
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:19,773
Whatever the case, pal,
he's out there somewhere

144
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:21,077
cruising this fuckin' boulevard.

145
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,152
Ooh, salt and pepper.

146
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,345
You operated that kid yet?

147
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,361
No, but I've seen
her around a lot.

148
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,290
She keeps her nose pretty clean.

149
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,809
You really know this area
pretty well, don't ya Collins?

150
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,982
Yeah, well I've worked
around here a lot of years.

151
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:44,215
How'd you like to get outta
those rags and help out?

152
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,239
Who me?

153
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,083
I thought you'd never ask!

154
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,995
Good.

155
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:50,948
Try to get rid of that.

156
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:52,831
I'll be back for it later.

157
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,949
Two blind lesbians
lost in a fish market.

158
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,889
That is crazy, get it?

159
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,619
Hey Crystal, you
know those stars

160
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,936
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?

161
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:54,768
My dad installed a lot of 'em.

162
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,356
Sure he did.

163
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,440
No really, really.

164
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:59,088
He was a terrazzo stone artist.

165
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:00,587
When I was about
five, he took me

166
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,731
to the dedication ceremonies

167
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:03,798
and he propped me
up on his shoulders

168
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,790
so I could see all
the movie stars.

169
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,077
That was the best
time of my life.

170
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,793
Hey, you kids should've seen

171
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,673
Hollywood Boulevard
25 years ago.

172
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,417
Then it was a boulevard
something to see.

173
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,253
Now it's a toilet!

174
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,591
An ulcer, that bum is
gonna give me an ulcer!

175
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:23,093
How's your mama, Angel?

176
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,266
Oh she's much better
and she loved your soup.

177
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,602
So does that bum,
son of a bitch.

178
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:31,892
I don't know about you ladies,

179
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:33,855
but it's lean out there tonight.

180
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,105
It's the murders, Mae.

181
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,482
Even the johns are scared.

182
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:37,816
Why should the
johns be scared?

183
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,318
It's the hookers gettin' killed.

184
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,612
Ever see a man try to run away

185
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:43,737
with his pants wrapped
around his ankles?

186
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:46,468
I don't know about you girls,

187
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,244
I wanna get the hell
outta this town.

188
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,497
Go somewhere where
there's clean air,

189
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:52,831
where I can breathe.

190
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,296
I dunno, maybe Tahiti.

191
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,047
Tahiti, why Tahiti?

192
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,758
Because the men use
their dicks for oars.

193
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:02,884
Ooh.

194
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:05,636
Goddamn it, Mae.

195
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,950
Fay and Sherry aren't even
cold in their graves yet,

196
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,860
and you can't stop
with the jokes.

197
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:15,064
You ever hear anybody
whistle in the graveyard?

198
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,774
Don't tell me no money.

199
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,109
You call that more, man?

200
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,195
You sit out before,
and don't come back!

201
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,201
At least the hookers,
they got money, they pay!

202
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,409
- My dear.
- What?

203
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,410
Relax!

204
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,163
Puff on this, huh?

205
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,124
I never saw it to fail.

206
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,669
Give a man something to
suck on, and he's happy.

207
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,256
Come, off we go.

208
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,650
Come on, let's
go back to work.

209
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,314
Okay, let's go by
the theater this time.

210
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:43,551
Okay.

211
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:46,442
Give me some.
Here.

212
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:50,619
You know what it says here?

213
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:51,435
It's ridiculous.

214
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,121
- Hey.
- What?

215
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:53,988
I'm gonna go see Yoyo.

216
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,082
Okay, 'cause he's so cute.

217
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,106
Yeah I know.

218
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:57,501
I'll see ya.

219
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:58,568
I'll see ya tomorrow.

220
00:13:58,593 --> 00:13:59,384
I have to study after this.

221
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:00,694
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

222
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:06,491
Mae West liked it.

223
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,311
I used to do it for her all
the time in her bedroom.

224
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,331
You like that?

225
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:12,665
Wait, wait, there's more.

226
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,126
Next show in a half an hour.

227
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,620
Thanks folks, your donations
will go to a worthy cause.

228
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:17,671
My survival!

229
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:20,382
Good show, Yoyo.

230
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,466
Thanks, Kit.

231
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,760
Goodnight.

232
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,195
You have a nice
evening, Crystal.

233
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Thanks, Kit.

234
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,221
Goodnight.

235
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:28,736
Oh, hi Crystal.

236
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:29,505
Hi.

237
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,202
Boy you look great.

238
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:32,227
Thank you.

239
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:38,694
I was with Kit and we,

240
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:40,027
you look great.

241
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:43,328
You really look good, I mean it.

242
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,367
I mean I guess
I look great huh?

243
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:48,484
So how's,

244
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,422
so how's business?

245
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,333
It's kinda like you, Yoyo.

246
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,668
Up and down.

247
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,419
Oh.

248
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:57,097
Get it?

249
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,910
Yeah.

250
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,026
Oh wait, let me show
you this new trick.

251
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,010
Okay.

252
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:03,871
Let me show you this.

253
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:07,682
Hold out your hand.

254
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:08,425
Like this?

255
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:17,484
Oh, that's beautiful!

256
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:22,107
It's yours.

257
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,864
- Thanks, Yoyo.
- You're welcome.

258
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,578
Maybe I'll see ya after work?

259
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:31,860
You can bet your top on it.

260
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,130
Bye.

261
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,739
Bye.

262
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:12,760
Ooh, just what I like.

263
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,616
Nice and strong.

264
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,213
Come on.

265
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:20,204
We're gonna have us
a real nice time.

266
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:23,136
I bet you can't guess
what I do in the daytime.

267
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:24,477
I go to school.

268
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,605
I'm studying to
be an accountant.

269
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,628
I got straight As
on my report card.

270
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,183
Oh, this is the place.

271
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:31,932
It's right over here,
it's number four.

272
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:33,902
Hey you know, I'm
into astrology.

273
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:34,984
I bet I could do your sign.

274
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,377
He's out like a light.

275
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,311
Hey you think
we should untie him?

276
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,704
That was the
easiest hundred I ever made.

277
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,736
Whoops, I forgot
my panties, girl.

278
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:59,115
Don't bother, the old
buzzard probably ate 'em.

279
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,879
Hey, you know I thought
he was dead at first?

280
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,135
We woke up lucky.

281
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:14,816
Shh.

282
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,633
Now this here is
called a tombstone twirl.

283
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,421
Yes sir, learned that
trick from Tom Mix.

284
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,093
Used to double 'em in
all of his pictures.

285
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:31,444
Matter of fact, I worked with
most of the old western stars.

286
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:32,779
Let's see there was Ken Maynard,

287
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,975
there was Buck Jones,
there was William...

288
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,817
Okay, I gotta a .45 finger
in your back, partner.

289
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,303
One false move,
and you're a goner.

290
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,838
Why you slippery
little sidewinder,

291
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,432
you went and snuck
up on me again.

292
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:49,955
I should've known
it was you two.

293
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,228
Here you go, sonny.

294
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:52,831
Hang that on the
wall and tell 'em

295
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,374
you got it from Kit
Carson in person.

296
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:58,128
Now.
- Damn pygmies.

297
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:59,713
What are you
doing out so late?

298
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:02,115
It's past midnight and it's
time for you to be home in bed.

299
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:06,052
Well, I was heading
that way now, partner.

300
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,046
You ladies mind
if I escort you?

301
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:09,705
Thank you.

302
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,105
Say, Angel.
- What?

303
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,442
Did I ever tell you
about the time your pappy and me

304
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:20,401
got thrown out of
the Brown Derby?

305
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,764
Yeah, but tell me again.

306
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,069
I like that one.

307
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,389
Or was it Musso and Frank's?

308
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,963
I'll tell you, when you've
been around as long as I have,

309
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:32,533
the old memory begins to dim
like a campfire at sunrise.

310
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,210
I'll tell you, we tipped
a few, your pappy and me.

311
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:36,982
I bet.

312
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,170
I miss him.

313
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:40,905
So do I.

314
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,141
Goodnight, Kit.

315
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:47,892
Goodnight, Angel.

316
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,103
- Come on, Mae.
- Come on.

317
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:53,509
Oh Angel.

318
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,995
Get yourself a good
night's sleep, you hear?

319
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,361
I will.

320
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,614
- Night ladies.
- Goodnight.

321
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:11,816
How about a little
drink, my dear?

322
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,712
Say a glass of 100
proof milk, huh?

323
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:16,885
Hey!

324
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:17,906
Girls!

325
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:18,841
Come here!

326
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,510
Bring out the spray, my dear.

327
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,946
I hear a cockroach.

328
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,510
Shall we investigate?

329
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:27,986
Oh, she's painting
by numbers again.

330
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:33,228
I wanna show you my
latest masterpiece.

331
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:37,654
I call it fruit with gun.

332
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,364
I call it shit.

333
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,699
What do you know
about it, fagele?

334
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,701
You don't even wear
the right clothes.

335
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,154
The hell are
you talking about?

336
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,989
This dress cost
me over 600 bucks.

337
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,748
Hey Solly, where'd
you get the cannon?

338
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,288
What are you crazy?

339
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,194
This is no toy, dear!

340
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,580
And for your information,
I bought it today.

341
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:57,675
Why, bear season
isn't even open yet.

342
00:20:58,015 --> 00:20:59,693
This psycho killer shows,

343
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,686
I'm gonna blow his
fuckin' head off.

344
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,764
Hey, you wanna play a game?

345
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:05,056
Why not?

346
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:06,359
I'll break out the board.

347
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,078
Oh hey, I gotta go study.

348
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:09,796
It's getting late, Mae.

349
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,895
Goodnight.

350
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,105
Goodnight honey.

351
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,667
- Goodnight Solly.
- Goodnight darling.

352
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,462
Sweet dreams.
- Thanks.

353
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:19,614
Have you noticed our
little Molly is growing up?

354
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:21,783
I've noticed that
you've noticed.

355
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:23,743
Now you keep your hands off her.

356
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:26,815
Listen, why don't you take
that thing out of your pants

357
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,623
before you blow your balls off?

358
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,027
All eight of them.

359
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:35,066
Who is it?

360
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,570
Solly!

361
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:38,470
Just wait a second, Solly.

362
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:45,586
I'll be right there.

363
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:51,959
Morning, darling.

364
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:52,960
Good morning, come on in.

365
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:53,878
It's rent time.

366
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:55,298
Oh gee, I almost forgot.

367
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:56,942
I was just serving
breakfast to my mom.

368
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,246
I'll have her write you a check.

369
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,810
I'll be right back.

370
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:24,912
Here you go, Solly.

371
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:27,331
Oh, thank you darling.

372
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:28,745
My mom says to say hello.

373
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,084
And how is your mother?

374
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:31,677
She's improving.

375
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,462
- Receipt.
- Oh great.

376
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:35,256
I gotta go dump the garbage.

377
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,382
Have a good day.

378
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,801
- Later darling.
- Bye.

379
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,585
Northup, Northup, rah rah rah!

380
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,730
Five, six, seven, eight!

381
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,952
V-V-V-I-C!

382
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,053
T-T-O-R-Y!

383
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:24,678
Victory, victory
for Northup High!

384
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:30,759
Hey, look who's coming.

385
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:33,011
You're always bragging
about all your scoring.

386
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:35,048
Here's one you
haven't even touched.

387
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:37,962
Oh ye of little faith.

388
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,092
Center the fuckin' ball, man.

389
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:41,973
All right, Rick, on three.

390
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:43,766
Set, two, three!

391
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:48,454
Touchdown.

392
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,493
Come on baby, no applause?

393
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,138
Look, I hear you're really smart,

394
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:56,838
and I was wondering if you
could help me with my homework.

395
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,082
Then I'll give you something
you can really applaud.

396
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,954
Gee Rick, I'd really
like to help you.

397
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:06,288
But I have better things to do.

398
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:09,777
Woo, Romeo!

399
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,027
Romeo Ricky!

400
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:14,876
Miss Allen?

401
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,299
Molly, is that you?

402
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:17,166
Yeah.

403
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:18,649
Oh I'll be right with you.

404
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:21,503
Just get this apron off before
I get covered with paint.

405
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,199
You are looking terrific!

406
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:24,224
How's it going?

407
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,267
- Good, good.
- Good.

408
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:26,268
You wanted to see me?

409
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,438
Yes, why don't you
have a seat right there?

410
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,290
Is there
something wrong, Miss Allen?

411
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:32,191
No, not a thing!

412
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,962
I just thought it'd be
nice to have a little chat.

413
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:36,155
What do you say?

414
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:37,960
- Okay.
- Great.

415
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,585
Well, you know Molly,

416
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,185
I'm just a little
curious about something.

417
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,858
I see here that
you're not taking part

418
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:51,452
in any of the social
activities at school,

419
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:53,147
and I was just wondering,

420
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:55,231
are you having difficulty
making friends?

421
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,325
No, not at all Miss Allen.

422
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:01,665
Well Molly, your parents are
paying a great deal of money

423
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,017
to see that you have
the very best education.

424
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,267
Well I don't understand.

425
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,103
I'm on top of the honors list.

426
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,156
There's more to life
than getting straight As.

427
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:13,905
That means excelling
outside of the classroom

428
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:15,737
as well as inside,
you understand?

429
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,156
Yes.

430
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,824
It's my mother.

431
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:21,702
She's had a stroke,
and she's paralyzed.

432
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,547
Oh, Molly, I didn't know.

433
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:26,999
I'm so sorry.

434
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,435
So you see, I don't have time

435
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,128
for school stuff
or clubs and stuff.

436
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,215
I have to go home right after
school and take care of her.

437
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:35,548
I understand.

438
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,375
Will you do me a favor?

439
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:45,065
If you ever have need to talk,

440
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:46,353
or I can help in any way,

441
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,189
would you call me
at that number?

442
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:50,523
Okay.

443
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:52,274
Promise?

444
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:53,109
Promise.

445
00:27:53,134 --> 00:27:53,829
Okay.

446
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,561
Thank you Miss
Allen, I appreciate it.

447
00:27:55,585 --> 00:27:56,107
Okay.

448
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:06,599
1247, 1247 meeting
the officer at 77 station.

449
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:14,395
1247, 1247 meet
the officer at 77 station.

450
00:28:16,385 --> 00:28:17,385
933 clear.

451
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,158
I was supposed
to meet her today,

452
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,668
and when she didn't come by I...

453
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,520
How long did you know her?

454
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:52,410
Not very long,
she was new in town.

455
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,676
How can anybody do
a thing like this?

456
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,390
Can you prove where you
were yesterday evening?

457
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,974
Yes sir.

458
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,308
Okay.

459
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,902
What's that you've
got there, son?

460
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,371
Who is it?

461
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,606
It's me.

462
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Hi Mae.

463
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:26,245
What's wrong?

464
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:27,861
Oh, baby.

465
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:29,919
It's Crystal.

466
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,526
What's wrong with Crystal?

467
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,092
Did you take a look in there?

468
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:37,707
It looked like a slaughterhouse!

469
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,097
There's blood everywhere!

470
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:42,191
There was blood on the
walls, on the ceiling,

471
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:43,471
the rug was sticky with it.

472
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,415
It looked like
Custer's last stand

473
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,639
without the fuckin' Indians!

474
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,716
Folks, would you
settle down please?

475
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,480
Hey, hold it!

476
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,491
What's the problem?

477
00:29:57,824 --> 00:29:59,480
Three of our friends are dead!

478
00:29:59,735 --> 00:30:02,408
That's the problem, now what
are you gonna do about it?

479
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:04,331
We're gonna do
the best we can.

480
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,610
That's not good
enough, obviously.

481
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:09,219
You catch this son
of a bitch, lieutenant!

482
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:11,801
Excuse me, ladies, and
we'll hang the bastard!

483
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,901
We're bringing in more men
and putting out extra patrols.

484
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,552
The rest is up to you.

485
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:18,930
I mean you ladies of the night.

486
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,799
Be careful on the
street, watch yourself.

487
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:24,166
Work in pairs if you can,
and for Christ's sakes,

488
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,512
stick to regulars.

489
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,522
Are you nuts?

490
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,621
What do you know
about our business?

491
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:32,819
No matter how insignificant
or trivial it appears,

492
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:34,862
it could be important.

493
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:36,239
Please phone.

494
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:44,335
Take it.

495
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,448
Thank you
fearless fa's dick.

496
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,995
I had a john that
has a travel agency.

497
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:07,112
He told me that if we go
to Tahiti in December,

498
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,765
you get 20% off.

499
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:10,550
Tahiti in December?

500
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:11,378
Bitchin!

501
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,671
You know what else is
that if we go as family?

502
00:31:13,695 --> 00:31:14,611
Yeah.

503
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:15,571
Which is sisters, right?

504
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:16,572
We get 50% off.

505
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:17,824
Oh wow.

506
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,261
Hey look, I got some
brochures, check it out.

507
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:20,565
It is so pretty,
I gotta tell ya.

508
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,263
Look in these
brochures are great.

509
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:23,914
When you said Tahiti I went...

510
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,328
I think I see our down
payment, I'll see you later.

511
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:00,453
What are you waiting for, honey?

512
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,359
Why didn't you take
your clothes off?

513
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:09,563
All right, you clean off the
tables, you set up the chairs,

514
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:11,347
and then you get
your ass out of here.

515
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:12,925
Yes sir, I'll do it right now.

516
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:18,818
Ah, uh-huh.

517
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:22,559
Thank you, thank you.

518
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:39,035
Excuse me, miss.

519
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:40,912
You were recommended to me.

520
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,873
Wanna take a little break?

521
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:47,329
Would you be interested?
- Why not?

522
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:57,847
A girlfriend and I
share this room, here.

523
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,462
Come on Lana, time's up.

524
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,731
What's the matter, can't
you talk with your mouth full?

525
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:12,664
Let us in, we'll have a
little menage a twat, huh?

526
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,340
I think we'd better do this
another time, definitely.

527
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:17,408
Hey hold it!

528
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:18,409
You're not going anywhere, cunt.

529
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,770
Let go of my arm!

530
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:21,153
Okay.

531
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,466
Okay.

532
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,586
Maybe this'll put a little
smile on your face, hm?

533
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,295
You better be 14, baby,

534
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,884
or I'm gonna throw you
back in for being too old.

535
00:33:34,217 --> 00:33:35,385
Now use your goddamn key.

536
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,486
Why don't you go
get cleaned up first?

537
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,070
All right, baby.

538
00:33:57,124 --> 00:33:59,818
But you pour yourself
into that bed,

539
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,621
'cause I'll be right out.

540
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,103
What's wrong?

541
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:43,937
Help me.

542
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,043
Look at it, Angel.

543
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,379
There must be something
else you remember.

544
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,096
Would you leave me alone?

545
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,757
I told you all I know.

546
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,843
It was dark, I
couldn't see that well.

547
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:56,804
What about his voice,

548
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,452
his speech pattern,
something he said?

549
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,283
He was across the street.

550
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,642
Is there
anything else you can tell us?

551
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:09,652
Yeah, he killed Lana,
I can tell you that.

552
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,395
Get this xeroxed,
put out an APB.

553
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:54,865
You got a pimp?

554
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,243
You think I'm stupid?

555
00:37:58,871 --> 00:37:59,871
Stupid?

556
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:01,915
Why would I think that?

557
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,794
Hell, you've got
everything going for you.

558
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:08,756
You're young,
attractive, healthy,

559
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,049
and you're swimming
around in a toilet bowl.

560
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,326
It's my life!

561
00:38:14,303 --> 00:38:15,303
The hell it is.

562
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,116
You think you're out
there by yourself?

563
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm on that street
too, goddamnit

564
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:20,286
and every time I see a kid
like you turning a trick,

565
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,134
I wanna blow up the
whole goddamn strip.

566
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:25,190
Leave me alone,
you're not my father!

567
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:27,292
You have no right to judge me.

568
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:29,260
You don't even know
anything about me!

569
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,522
How old are you?

570
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:40,167
15, 16?

571
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,568
You know what happens
to used up whores?

572
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:48,297
They don't go to
Leisure World, baby.

573
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,285
They end up on
hard shit or booze,

574
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:53,152
and spend half their
time in the slammer

575
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:54,571
and that's just
where you're headed.

576
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,514
You're living in a
dream world, baby.

577
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,420
What you need is a good,
swift kick in the butt.

578
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,100
You think I'm proud
of what I'm doing?

579
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:04,080
I hate it, bunch
of fat old slobs

580
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:06,024
drooling and
slobbering all over me?

581
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:08,168
Sometimes I get so
disgusted with myself

582
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,653
I just think I wanna throw up!

583
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:13,331
Then why do you do it?

584
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:17,511
I have my reasons, and
believe me I have no intention

585
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:19,339
of doing this the
rest of my life!

586
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:22,382
What do you think
this is, a game?

587
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:24,502
You think you get
away Scott free?

588
00:39:25,635 --> 00:39:27,862
Everything in life has
a price on it, Angel.

589
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,649
Whatever you do,
you pay the price.

590
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,126
Somewhere down the line,
you're gonna have to pay.

591
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,353
Then I'll pay!

592
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,919
Then there
was the Durango Kid.

593
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,902
His real name was Charles Derek.

594
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:50,720

Toughest star I
ever worked with

600
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,317
was Franklin Fineham
in Rough Gulch.

601
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:05,051
Then there was that time
I broke a leg in a movie stage.

602
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:07,755
The Duke himself signed my cast.

603
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:10,174
He was a tough one,
did his own stunts.

604
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,926
Well folks, I could
go on all night,

605
00:40:12,254 --> 00:40:13,560
but it's getting late.

606
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:16,180
I think I saw that
on television last week.

607
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,183
That was a good movie, too.

608
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,022
The Indians came around,
and they had a stagecoach...

609
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:24,417
Lana's dead, Mae.

610
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,359
I know, baby, I know.

611
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:31,405
Come on, come on, let's go home.

612
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,157
Come on, baby.

613
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,490

617
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,263
Oh I love it.

618
00:40:55,597 --> 00:40:58,726
Will you please put that
cap pistol away, Mr. Cornwall?

619
00:40:58,918 --> 00:40:59,876
Carson!

620
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:02,754
The name is Carson, Kit Carson!

621
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:05,379
Hey hey, what's going on here?

622
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:09,256
Old baldy here is the
executor to Kit's estate.

623
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:11,590
He wants to put sweet little
old Kit here in one of those

624
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:14,464
creepy retirement homes.

625
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,260
That'd mean I'd never be able

626
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:17,828
to walk the boulevard
again, Angel.

627
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:20,832
You can't force him
to do that, can ya?

628
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:23,052
You're damn right he can't.

629
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:24,920
No, I don't think so.

630
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,297
You better let him go, Kit.

631
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,043
Thank you.

632
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,141
If you can't force him,
let's just leave him be.

633
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,723
Young lady, I have been
a lawyer for 25 years.

634
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,439
Listen, schmucko.

635
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:40,339
You heard what the
young lady said.

636
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:43,155
Now get your ass
outta here, okay?

637
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:50,631
Hey cheapo, I get
five bucks for that.

638
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:53,962
Come sit, sweetie.

639
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:57,996
Well, when I get ready
to be put out to pasture,

640
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,572
I know exactly where I'm going.

641
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,205
Arizona, well hell all of
my friends are out there.

642
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,169
I'll get to see Tom Mix again.

643
00:42:05,671 --> 00:42:08,423
Kit, Tom Mix is dead.

644
00:42:11,218 --> 00:42:14,430
Oh that's right, I
plum forgot about that.

645
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,610
Well hell, then I'll
see Hoot Gibson.

646
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,774
I think Hoot
Gibson's dead too.

647
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,353
Damn it.

648
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,337
There ain't hardly any
of us left anymore.

649
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:34,801
Look, I'm really
glad I found you two,

650
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:36,595
because I was just on
my way to the morgue.

651
00:42:37,982 --> 00:42:38,982
For Lana!

652
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,366
Do you have any idea what
they do to unclaimed bodies?

653
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,796
No, I don't reckon I do.

654
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:49,546
Oh, well I don't either,

655
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,094
but whatever it is
it can't be good.

656
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:53,794
Well we'd better
get over there,

657
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:56,234
before she ends up in a
tomb for the unknown hooker.

658
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,203
You had no business
being at the morgue.

659
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,519
What the hell did you
expect to accomplish?

660
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:04,374
We've got a right
to claim the body.

661
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,109
We're the only family she have.

662
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:10,160
I can appreciate that, Angel,
but I don't make the rules.

663
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,366
You mean to say there
ain't no exceptions?

664
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,454
Look, there's nothing I can
do about it, it's the law.

665
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:18,987
Then the law sucks.

666
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,394
You people have
got Lana in an icebox

667
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:24,545
while you sit on your...

668
00:43:26,346 --> 00:43:28,775
She needs to be buried,
but you don't give a damn.

669
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:31,207
You've got no feelings inside!

670
00:43:31,928 --> 00:43:34,055
It's because you're
nothing but a damn cop!

671
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:39,382
Come on Mae, Kit,
let's get outta here.

672
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:43,787
Remind me never
to get murdered.

673
00:45:03,552 --> 00:45:05,210
Ooh, strong aren't you?

674
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,538
I bet you're wild
in the sack, huh?

675
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,853
Rick, I'm gonna be
late for gym class.

676
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:12,111
Oh come on, you don't know
what you're missing, Molly.

677
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:15,564
I mean why do you think
they call me Razzle Dazzle?

678
00:45:16,877 --> 00:45:18,329
Oh, my hand!

679
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:19,998
You bitch!

680
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,145
We are gonna have
so much fun you guys.

681
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,647
We're gonna have the
best game in the world.

682
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:25,951
Okay, we've got
the victory song,

683
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:28,235
we've got the
Northup rah rah rah.

684
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,300
We'll do the fight song,

685
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:30,664
and it will just be so much fun,

686
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,180
so you guys really liven up
and have a great time with it.

687
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:34,957
Stephanie, hurry up!

688
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:36,424
Hi Molly.

689
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:37,655
Hi there.

690
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:39,083
Wait up!

691
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:46,693
Diane!

692
00:45:48,169 --> 00:45:49,169
Diane?

693
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,753
Hey scumbag, get your
dirty boots off the seat.

694
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:08,625
This ain't your fucking office.

695
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:25,936
Get the fuck outta here.

696
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:26,576
What he hell...

697
00:47:27,717 --> 00:47:32,472
♪ You've got something sweet

698
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:38,311
♪ You've got what I need

699
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:40,365
♪ Come to me

700
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,450
Yes, inside, yes.

701
00:47:47,446 --> 00:47:48,638
Damn right I saw him.

702
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,295
He's got a spur on his boot.

703
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:51,787
He's sitting right over here.

704
00:47:56,838 --> 00:47:59,058
Shit, well goddamn it
the sleaze bag was here

705
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,794
not more than 10 minutes ago.

706
00:48:01,127 --> 00:48:02,879
There he is!
- You, hold it right there.

707
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,213
Freeze!

708
00:48:17,286 --> 00:48:19,685
Gentlemen, turn
to your left please.

709
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,841
Would you face front?

710
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,091
Angel?

711
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,674
I don't know, I'm not sure.

712
00:48:39,054 --> 00:48:41,640
He could be the second
one from the left.

713
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:43,591
Could be is not enough, Angel.

714
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:45,257
I gotta have more than that.

715
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,170
I only took one look at him,

716
00:48:47,388 --> 00:48:49,637
and it was dark, I'm sorry.
I just got...

717
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:51,449
I can't swear by it.

718
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,504
Thanks
for your help, gentlemen.

719
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,418
You can take the men back.

720
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:01,232
Lieutenant, the
rookie with the coffee.

721
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:02,686
His weapon's in his holster.

722
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:06,004
Will the officer
holding the refreshments

723
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:07,684
please exit the
room immediately?

724
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:08,997
On the double.

725
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:10,634
I repeat...
- That's him, that's him!

726
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:11,895
The guy at the booth!

727
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:38,614
Sir, do you see
anything over there?

728
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,324
Check the alley
on the other side.

729
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:46,613
Get the chopper and
cordon the area.

730
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:47,946
Right.

731
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,727
He went over the
wall, lieutenant.

732
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,592
We found the girl
unconscious between the cars.

733
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:02,727
She's alive.

734
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:04,433
- Collins, we need you.
- Right there.

735
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:05,924
Shit!

736
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,584
All
units, shots fired.

737
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,832
Hostile situation,
officer detail.

738
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:14,934
Don't worry about
it, we'll get him.

739
00:50:18,437 --> 00:50:19,438
Come on.

740
00:50:58,791 --> 00:50:59,791
Shit.

741
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:06,779
Really blew that.

742
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:09,394
Have to pack it in.

743
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:15,956
Second time I had a scene
like that in 15 years.

744
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,041
What happened the first time?

745
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:25,848
Come on, I'll take you in.

746
00:51:36,188 --> 00:51:37,773
Thanks a lot,
Lieutenant Andrews.

747
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:43,041
I know, I won't leave town
without notifying you.

748
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:44,907
Isn't that the way it goes?

749
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:46,571
Very good.

750
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,441
I want to meet your mother.

751
00:51:49,658 --> 00:51:50,743
What, what no!

752
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:53,076
Wait a minute, there's a
law against illegal entry!

753
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:57,750
Hey, this is really great!

754
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,556
Why don't you go out
and catch that killer?

755
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,861
You're not gonna
find him in here.

756
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:06,801
I'm curious about
something, Angel.

757
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:08,586
Or is it Molly?

758
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:11,221
That's your name, isn't it?

759
00:52:11,488 --> 00:52:12,488
Molly Stewart?

760
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,991
Tell me something, Molly.

761
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,741
Why does 15 year old
straight A honor student

762
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:21,663
who doesn't drink,
doesn't take drugs,

763
00:52:21,942 --> 00:52:24,904
never been arrested, and
lives at home with her parents

764
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:26,906
work as a street prostitute, hm?

765
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,650
You've been to my
school, haven't you?

766
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,344
Yeah,
it's a good school.

767
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:32,661
They think a lot of you.

768
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:34,806
Yeah well I don't like people
butting into my business.

769
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,999
You work the street,
you're fair game kiddo.

770
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,124
Where's your mother?

771
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,126
I want to speak to her.

772
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,901
She doesn't want
to speak with you!

773
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:42,164
She doesn't like cops either!

774
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:45,030
In there huh?

775
00:52:49,763 --> 00:52:51,043
Mrs. Stewart, my
name is Andrews.

776
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:52,264
I'm with the police.

777
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:53,345
I'd like to speak with you.

778
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,056
Mrs. Stewart?

779
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:05,615
Get away from there,
you son of a bitch!

780
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,480
Haven't you ever heard
of the Fourth Amendment?

781
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,176
You mean the
right of the people

782
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,640
to be secure in
their persons against

783
00:53:10,743 --> 00:53:13,103
unreasonable search and
seizure shall not be violated?

784
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,311
Yes, I've heard of it.

785
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:17,681
Pardon me.

786
00:54:26,615 --> 00:54:28,742
Pretty, nice.

787
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:34,518
I like the color.

788
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:47,826
Your dad?

789
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,813
How long has he been gone?

790
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:01,234
Nine years.

791
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:05,855
Where's your mom, Angel?

792
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:27,217
Molly.

793
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:29,472
Please try to forgive me.

794
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:31,891
I found somebody.

795
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:35,603
He's taking me to New York.

796
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,107
Don't think I'll be back.

797
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:44,154
Take care of yourself,
I'm sorry, Mom.

798
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:50,494
Knowing her she probably
got dumped in Cleveland.

799
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:55,549
It happened about
three years ago.

800
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:58,825
One day I came home from
school, and she was gone.

801
00:56:00,254 --> 00:56:03,967
Just that note and a hundred dollar bill.

802
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:09,055
You've been on the
streets since you were 12?

803
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:12,976
It was easy.

804
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,313
I just put on some sexy
clothes and high heels

805
00:56:16,646 --> 00:56:18,397
and went out and made a living.

806
00:56:18,815 --> 00:56:19,815
Jesus Christ.

807
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:26,297
You still don't
understand, do ya Andrews?

808
00:56:26,764 --> 00:56:29,569
I was alone, I'm a minor!

809
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:32,084
They'd throw my
ass in some court,

810
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:34,999
and then it'd be foster
homes from then on.

811
00:56:35,152 --> 00:56:37,476
I am not gonna be put
in some foster home,

812
00:56:37,548 --> 00:56:41,928
or some institution, or
somebody else's home.

813
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:43,372
I am gonna stay right here

814
00:56:43,558 --> 00:56:45,962
until my father
comes back for me.

815
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,601
Until your father comes back?

816
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,813
Yes damn it, until
my father comes back.

817
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:58,425
What
makes you think

818
00:56:58,488 --> 00:56:59,855
he's coming back
after nine years?

819
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,154
My father will.

820
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:06,949
I know he will.

821
00:57:11,652 --> 00:57:13,219
So what are you gonna
do now, lieutenant?

822
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:18,537
I know what I should do.

823
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:21,858
I should turn you over to
the juvenile authorities,

824
00:57:21,882 --> 00:57:22,925
let them take care of ya.

825
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:26,095
So why don't you?

826
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:32,023
I don't know.

827
00:57:39,149 --> 00:57:40,734
Stay home, keep the door locked.

828
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:50,340
For Christ's sake, stay away
from the goddamn street.

829
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:44,073
I've already made
up my mind, Mae.

830
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:44,903
I'm against it.

831
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:46,922
Dead set against it.

832
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:49,812
Somebody could get
hurt, honey, you.

833
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,176
You weren't there,
you didn't see

834
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:53,406
the way that guy looked at me.

835
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,857
I'm not letting
that freak get to me

836
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:56,743
like he did Crystal and Lana.

837
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:58,855
I don't know about
you, but I'm hungry.

838
00:59:58,887 --> 00:59:59,992
Hungry?

839
01:00:00,117 --> 01:00:01,994
How could you eat
at a time like this?

840
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:02,861
Watch.

841
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:06,572
Whatever you got in that
box would make me throw up.

842
01:00:18,316 --> 01:00:19,316
Oh.

843
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,221
Welcome to my home, ma'am.

844
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:27,472
Wow!

845
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,353
This is really cool.

846
01:01:33,729 --> 01:01:34,730
It's great!

847
01:01:36,774 --> 01:01:38,317
This is where you live?
- Yep.

848
01:01:39,485 --> 01:01:40,485
What's this?

849
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,406
Best of luck, Kit.

850
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,784
Keep them shooting
irons of yourn hot,

851
01:01:46,117 --> 01:01:47,994
especially the
one in your pants.

852
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:49,829
Regards, Tom Mix.

853
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:51,443
Tom Mix, you really
did know him!

854
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:53,124
Well you don't
think I'd josh you

855
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,835
about a thing like that, do ya?

856
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:59,339
Well, I'm gonna give you a
shooting iron lesson, little lady,

857
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:02,551
and I want you to
listen real good,

858
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,387
'cause there ain't
nothing to it.

859
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,015
First of all, you
don't aim at all.

860
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,850
You pretend the
barrel is your finger,

861
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,464
and you point it
and you shoot it

862
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,688
just like you did
when you was a kid.

863
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,696
Well that was the pretend part.

864
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,158
Now this here is the real part.

865
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,962
I thought those were toys!

866
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,298
What in tarnation would
I be doing with toys?

867
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,260
These have got the firing pins
in them, and real bullets.

868
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:46,431
Now, these here are the bullets
I use out on the street,

869
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:47,764
and they're fake.

870
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,890
Oh.

871
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,105
Now, let me see that
peashooter of yours.

872
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:01,821
Good god almighty.

873
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:18,839
Lookin' good!

874
01:03:26,477 --> 01:03:28,861
Woohoo,
look at those legs!

875
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,154
All aboard beaver junction!

876
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:34,612
I don't fuckin' believe it.

877
01:03:34,637 --> 01:03:35,554
Do you know who that was?

878
01:03:35,696 --> 01:03:37,114
That was Molly Stewart!

879
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:38,825
She's a hooker.

880
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,320
No shit!

881
01:03:40,685 --> 01:03:41,685
Let's pick her up.

882
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,161
Hey mama, I got
what you're looking for.

883
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:50,288
♪ Don't you agree

884
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:52,432
♪ Sweet

885
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,350
- Come on Molly.
- Come on, hurry up!

886
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,085
- Let's go Rick!
- Come on!

887
01:03:57,215 --> 01:03:59,592
- Go go, go go!
- Wahoo!

888
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:19,365
Look Rick, you've
had your fun.

889
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:21,011
Now please let me go.

890
01:04:22,669 --> 01:04:24,907
Oh you know, you're really
one hell of an actress.

891
01:04:26,285 --> 01:04:27,829
You had us all fooled.

892
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,859
So sweet, so innocent.

893
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:34,127
Oh come on, Molly, show
us your whisker biscuit.

894
01:04:35,368 --> 01:04:36,553
Listen you guys, if you
know what's good for you,

895
01:04:37,093 --> 01:04:38,328
you'll let me go right now.

896
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,523
Oh no, no, no!

897
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:42,616
We're gonna teach you a
new meaning of gang bang.

898
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:45,233
Please, wait, wait you
don't have to force me.

899
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,179
I'll do anything you want!

900
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:48,568
Look, I just don't
wanna get pregnant.

901
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:50,185
Tough shit, bitch.

902
01:04:51,145 --> 01:04:52,148
'Cause we don't use rubbers.

903
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:54,621
Please, I've got some
right here in my purse.

904
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,091
Hey Rick, maybe we should.

905
01:04:56,648 --> 01:04:58,694
No telling what we might
catch from this slut.

906
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:00,943
Okay.

907
01:05:01,432 --> 01:05:02,826
I always keep them with me.

908
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:07,352
Ah!

909
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:09,500
Go ahead, make your move,

910
01:05:09,664 --> 01:05:11,499
but I'll blow his
fucking brains out.

911
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:13,752
Rick, don't anybody move!

912
01:05:14,298 --> 01:05:15,065
Rick.

913
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,230
Okay you bastards,
now get out of the car.

914
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:21,342
Get out of the goddamn car!

915
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,711
Let's get out, Rick.

916
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:24,224
She's bluffing.

917
01:05:24,538 --> 01:05:25,998
Oh yeah?

918
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,636
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

919
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:31,050
Please please don't shoot me!

920
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:33,728
- Hey!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!

921
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:34,463
Hey.

922
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,613
Look me up again, Rick.

923
01:05:42,782 --> 01:05:44,335
When you're toilet trained.

924
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,778
Sarah listen, did
you hear about Molly Stewart?

925
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:12,583
No, what?

926
01:06:12,824 --> 01:06:13,574
Rick Sawyer
said she made it

927
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:15,262
with all three of them.

928
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,371
Oh god, that's gross!

929
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:18,890
Wait listen,
that's not all.

930
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,073
He said, and I swear
to god, she's a whore!

931
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:23,434
Oh no!

932
01:06:23,494 --> 01:06:25,552
Yeah, and she's
hooking on Hollywood Boulevard.

933
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:26,888
Oh shit.

934
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:31,482
Oh gee, I really liked her.

935
01:06:32,149 --> 01:06:32,927
Yeah.

936
01:06:36,213 --> 01:06:38,674
Miss Allen, I'm telling
you what I saw is the truth!

937
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:39,791
This is ridiculous.

938
01:06:39,948 --> 01:06:41,228
I know this girl very, very well

939
01:06:41,354 --> 01:06:42,790
and what you're saying
is absolutely impossible!

940
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,073
Miss Allen, the
girl is a prostitute

941
01:06:44,097 --> 01:06:45,348
on Hollywood Boulevard.

942
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:46,766
This is ridiculous.

943
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:24,870
Molly, Molly.

944
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:26,182
What is it Wayne?

945
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,877
I just wanted to ask you out.

946
01:07:28,351 --> 01:07:29,990
I told you, my mother
won't let me out.

947
01:07:30,189 --> 01:07:31,106
No, no, no, look.

948
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:33,773
I've been saving this, it's $23.

949
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:35,107
It's all I've got.

950
01:07:36,693 --> 01:07:37,693
Will it be enough?

951
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:48,612
Molly?

952
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:44,504
I used to love
going to school.

953
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,252
You know I used to pretend

954
01:08:46,392 --> 01:08:49,436
that I was just
like everybody else.

955
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:51,861
Now they all know the truth.

956
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,685
You know, I've had sex
with hundreds of men,

957
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:08,633
but I've never had anybody
that loved me, or held me.

958
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:11,042
I mean not anybody that
I wanted to be with.

959
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,170
I've never even had a boyfriend.

960
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:18,289
You know, I wake
up every morning

961
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,906
and I think this is the
last day I have to do this.

962
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,929
Today my dad's gonna come home.

963
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:33,172
You still believe that?

964
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,357
Nah.

965
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:38,912
Not anymore.

966
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:45,451
You know Angel, sometimes
a guy meets a woman

967
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:47,838
and he sees a new
life for himself,

968
01:09:48,258 --> 01:09:52,229
so he splits, cuts his
ties with whatever he had.

969
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,011
Time goes by and comes a point when

970
01:09:56,948 --> 01:09:59,134
where he can't come
back, no matter what.

971
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:03,189
It's not 'cause he
doesn't love you.

972
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,797
Then all I've done has
been a waste, hasn't it?

973
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,190
Nothing's a waste, kid.

974
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,200
Nothing.

975
01:10:15,266 --> 01:10:17,185
I feel so ashamed.

976
01:10:29,824 --> 01:10:30,824
Easy, kid.

977
01:10:32,385 --> 01:10:33,385
Easy.

978
01:10:41,634 --> 01:10:43,344
What have you
done to your hair?

979
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:45,045
Looks like an orangutan has been

980
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:46,836
sitting on your face all night.

981
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,356
Good, good, good.

982
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,942
Whee, oh.

983
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Mhmm.

984
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:06,996
Grab it.

985
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:11,755
A queen, how sweet.

986
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:18,310
Listen, kumquat.

987
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:20,804
I don't mind the smoke, but
your breath is behind it.

988
01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:22,349
Don't you ever inhale that?

989
01:11:23,721 --> 01:11:24,401
God.

990
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:30,229
What was that?

991
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:32,233
What?

992
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,483
This, you took
this little thing

993
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:36,817
and moved it from here to here.

994
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:37,983
Now that's not nice.

995
01:11:38,446 --> 01:11:40,224
It's called cheating, okay?

996
01:11:41,366 --> 01:11:42,701
How fuckin' dare you?

997
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:44,759
How fuckin' dare you, ya cunt?

998
01:11:45,023 --> 01:11:47,146
I don't have to cheat to
beat the likes of you!

999
01:11:47,442 --> 01:11:48,861
You're not
playing with blind Amy,

1000
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:50,672
I saw you move the goddamn peg.

1001
01:11:50,775 --> 01:11:52,062
You're hallucinating!

1002
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:53,146
I'm gonna bite your
goddamn falsies off,

1003
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,964
now play this game here.

1004
01:11:55,869 --> 01:11:56,830
You're stalling!

1005
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,996
You owe me $147, see that?

1006
01:11:59,226 --> 01:12:01,371
I owe you shit.

1007
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:04,606
Screw you, Lulu Bell!

1008
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:06,668
When I was a kid,
my father warned me.

1009
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,855
He said Rachel, don't ever
play cards with a Jewish dyke.

1010
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:11,266
They cheat!

1011
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,777
Eat my puff, will ya?

1012
01:12:13,402 --> 01:12:13,816
Puff?

1013
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:14,480
Hello.

1014
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:16,402
One moment.

1015
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:19,172
Look, unless you have
an instant replay

1016
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,890
and you can prove on that
last move that I cheated,

1017
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:23,870
you will continue
this goddamn game!

1018
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,445
I don't need a camera, I
have eyes, you cheat, cheat!

1019
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:28,255
Hello?

1020
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:29,692
Hold onto your jack jack!

1021
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,329
Now listen, freeze
everything there.

1022
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,014
I know where every peg is!

1023
01:12:35,863 --> 01:12:36,764
I'll be right back.

1024
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:42,105
What do you want?

1025
01:12:43,598 --> 01:12:45,225
You have a Margaret
Stewart here?

1026
01:12:45,426 --> 01:12:47,094
I'd like to see her,
if you don't mind.

1027
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:51,106
Molly Stewart is her daughter.

1028
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,952
I'm her counselor at
school, Patricia Allen.

1029
01:12:55,342 --> 01:12:57,678
Yeah well now that
woman's an invalid.

1030
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,885
She don't see nobody.

1031
01:12:59,714 --> 01:13:02,217
Yes, I understand but would
you ring her for me please?

1032
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:03,817
I'd like to find
that out for myself.

1033
01:13:04,627 --> 01:13:05,480
Ring her?

1034
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,706
What do you think
this is, a Biltmore?

1035
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:09,917
You gotta wait 'til Molly
gets home from school.

1036
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:13,285
I don't gotta do anything.

1037
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,860
Now I would really like
to speak to Mrs. Stewart.

1038
01:13:16,127 --> 01:13:17,429
What room is she in please?

1039
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:24,234
Look, Miss Hoighty toighty.

1040
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:27,391
The woman cannot
answer the goddamn door

1041
01:13:27,467 --> 01:13:30,093
'cause she can't get
out of her goddamn bed.

1042
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,332
Is that goddamn
clear enough for ya?

1043
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,720
Well, if you give me the key

1044
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,073
then we won't have to
inconvenience the woman now,

1045
01:13:38,129 --> 01:13:38,870
will we?

1046
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:41,581
You don't seem to
understand, lady.

1047
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,538
I can't just give someone the
key to someone's apartment.

1048
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:48,919
Listen, fuckface.

1049
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:51,354
I used to work for the
city health department

1050
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:53,544
and you got so many
violations in this flea trap

1051
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,756
that one phone call downtown

1052
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,410
will put your ass
in court so fast

1053
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,866
that you won't have
time to wipe it,

1054
01:13:58,093 --> 01:14:00,578
let alone pull your pants
up, do you get my drift?

1055
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,124
Now you give me the goddamn key.

1056
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,984
Thank you, very much.

1057
01:14:17,655 --> 01:14:21,201
Teh, the fuckin'
mouth on that broad.

1058
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:29,496
Oh.

1059
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:31,121
Hi, honey.

1060
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:34,006
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1061
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:35,423
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1062
01:14:35,424 --> 01:14:36,759
I was looking for Mrs. Stewart.

1063
01:14:37,092 --> 01:14:37,884
I'll just check on...

1064
01:14:37,885 --> 01:14:38,885
Oh no, no, no, no.

1065
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,144
I am Mrs. Stewart,
please come in.

1066
01:14:42,306 --> 01:14:44,636
This is the right
apartment, lovely.

1067
01:14:45,476 --> 01:14:48,345
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

1068
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:51,534
All this talk about me
being an invalid, you know?

1069
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:55,323
Well, sometimes I am an
invalid and sometimes I'm not.

1070
01:14:56,571 --> 01:14:57,571
It just comes and goes,

1071
01:14:57,822 --> 01:15:00,200
and now it's all gone

1072
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:03,870
so won't you join
me in sitting down

1073
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:06,123
and a little
conversation please?

1074
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,457
Thank you.

1075
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:11,467
Yes, the girls and I,

1076
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:13,439
I give a course on needlepoint

1077
01:15:13,464 --> 01:15:15,966
and sometimes they
get a little messy.

1078
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:18,038
I must talk to the girls.

1079
01:15:18,137 --> 01:15:20,599
Now, what shall we talk about?

1080
01:15:21,574 --> 01:15:23,359
Look I don't know
whose mother you are,

1081
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:25,156
but you are definitely
not Molly's.

1082
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:28,562
I'm not?

1083
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:30,272
No.

1084
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:32,467
You're right.

1085
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:36,716
But I love her.

1086
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:39,343
More than her mother ever did.

1087
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:07,715
What the hell?

1088
01:16:09,854 --> 01:16:10,854
Shit.

1089
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,244
We gotta get her
off the streets.

1090
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:39,793
We've gotta find her a home.

1091
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:41,042
And soon.

1092
01:16:41,267 --> 01:16:42,577
Now Mae, you know how
much I care for Molly

1093
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,267
and I will do anything
I can to help.

1094
01:16:44,507 --> 01:16:45,525
You keep me posted, all right?

1095
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:46,729
Okay.

1096
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,018
Hey, let me help you out.

1097
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,649
Oh, by the way,
what's your real name?

1098
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:54,191
Marvin.

1099
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:55,627
Marvin Walker.

1100
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,163
Oh, well it has been a
pleasure meeting you, Marvin.

1101
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,700
Thank you.

1102
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,413
I meant to ask you,
that dress, Saks?

1103
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:09,989
I. Magnin's.

1104
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,304
Oh, stunning.

1105
01:17:12,756 --> 01:17:13,756
Thank you.

1106
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:18,442
I got it on sale.

1107
01:17:42,554 --> 01:17:43,847
Who dyed your hair, dickface?

1108
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,168
Hey, hey now wait a minute now.

1109
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:48,373
You got me all wrong.

1110
01:17:48,556 --> 01:17:51,150
I'm not a, I'm not
a girl, I'm a guy.

1111
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:52,013
See this?

1112
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:53,674
Look at all this
hair like this, huh?

1113
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:55,147
Look, look.

1114
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:56,298
Phony tits.

1115
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:57,679
You like impressions?

1116
01:17:57,726 --> 01:17:59,141
I do a great Eddie Cantor,
how do you like this?

1117
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,543
♪ You knew Susie
like I know Susie

1118
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,351
Huh, ah before your
time of course.

1119
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:06,154
Rock music, that's
your bag isn't it?

1120
01:18:06,508 --> 01:18:08,358
Listen to this, ah!

1121
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:08,905
Oh!

1122
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,140
My hair, my hair!

1123
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,011
My luck I gotta get a
bald head in fighting.

1124
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:45,324
About your breath,
ew that stinks.

1125
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:16,830
Fuck with me!

1126
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:18,927
Bitch!

1127
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,913
Please!

1128
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:40,516
Oh my god.

1129
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:50,295
Mae?

1130
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:52,933
Darling.

1131
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:56,155
Oh no.

1132
01:19:56,445 --> 01:19:57,613
Just my luck.

1133
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:03,276
Last thing I'm gonna see in
this world is your ugly face.

1134
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:04,733
Christ.

1135
01:20:04,775 --> 01:20:06,277
Oh what are you doing?

1136
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:09,287
Dying, goddamnit, I'm dying.

1137
01:20:09,678 --> 01:20:10,845
Geez.

1138
01:20:12,258 --> 01:20:16,584
You can't die, you owe
me $147 you fuckin' faggot.

1139
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:18,476
Solly?

1140
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:19,850
What darling?

1141
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,991
I don't want Angel to
see me like this, okay?

1142
01:20:24,145 --> 01:20:25,188
Promise?

1143
01:20:25,327 --> 01:20:27,076
Yes I promise,
you gorgeous broad.

1144
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:28,290
Thanks, baby.

1145
01:20:29,767 --> 01:20:30,767
Oh Jesus.

1146
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:34,373
Mae.

1147
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:39,842
Darling?

1148
01:20:41,714 --> 01:20:42,714
Mae?

1149
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,514
Sweetheart?

1150
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,217
Don't go, darling, sweetie.

1151
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:54,280
You gorgeous broad.

1152
01:21:42,924 --> 01:21:44,280
You don't wanna go in there.

1153
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:46,481
You don't wanna go in there!

1154
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,419
In the bedroom, officer.

1155
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:54,546
Believe me, you don't
wanna see it, honey?

1156
01:21:54,726 --> 01:21:55,768
Just stay here.

1157
01:21:57,426 --> 01:21:59,511
You stay right here.

1158
01:22:07,234 --> 01:22:08,401
Answer is 257.

1159
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,520
Angel!

1160
01:22:18,131 --> 01:22:19,131
Angel, Angel!

1161
01:22:23,135 --> 01:22:24,135
Officer?

1162
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:26,379
Officer!

1163
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,262
Need a full team
here right away.

1164
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,676
Officer, she's got my gun!

1165
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:10,356
Kit, Angel, you seen her?

1166
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:11,309
Oh no I haven't.

1167
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:12,622
She's on the street
and she's got a gun.

1168
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:13,552
Good lord, allmight.

1169
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,396
All right you take that
side, I'll go this way.

1170
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:16,469
All right.

1171
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:21,462
Hey!

1172
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:26,893
Angel look out!

1173
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:29,732
Angel, hey, Angel!

1174
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:42,498
Out of my trunk, asshole!

1175
01:25:49,688 --> 01:25:51,399
Get outta the way!

1176
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:34,475
Hold it!

1177
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:36,551
Oh shit!

1178
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:52,729
Kit, you okay?

1179
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:54,275
Help Angel.

1180
01:27:52,509 --> 01:27:54,887
Angel get back,
leave him to me!

1181
01:28:00,678 --> 01:28:01,868
Listen to me, kid.

1182
01:28:03,107 --> 01:28:03,967
Angel.

1183
01:28:06,256 --> 01:28:06,850
Angel.

1184
01:29:16,506 --> 01:29:17,507
It hurts.

1185
01:29:29,714 --> 01:29:30,714
It hurts.
