1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,805
Step away from the curb, children.

2
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:45,267
Hi, Sister!
You look terrific today!

3
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,598
- What have you done with your hair?
- You're late again, Rick.

4
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,041
- I know. But I have a very good excuse.
- There can be no excuse for tardiness.

5
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,913
You're right. You're
absolutely right.

6
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,449
I should never have stopped and
saved that drowning infant.

7
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,951
I'm weak, Sister! I'm just so weak!

8
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,216
All right, now. Stop that.

9
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,588
Children, on the bus.

10
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:11,859
Sister, if you ever get lonely after
vespers, I'm the man to call.

11
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,696
My number's in the book.

12
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:17,236
Get going, Rick.
You're late enough as it is.

13
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:19,034
Think about it, OK?

14
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,676
OK, come along, children!

15
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:29,883
Attention, passengers.

16
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:35,219
We are now leaving Nun Central on
our journey to hell and beyond.

17
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,853
The captain has turned
off the No Smoking sign.

18
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,760
You may now move about
the cabin freely.

19
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,669
Thank you for being Catholic, and for
choosing the St Gabriel school bus.

20
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:16,466
Now don't forget, Garcia. Ten
percent of that goes to the house.

21
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,105
Ahh, youth!

22
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:29,414
You'll love these shots. Thank you very
much, Mrs Reeves. Have a nice day.

23
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:31,317
Next!

24
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,627
Ho-ho-ho! Look at those babies!

25
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:46,532
Adorable. Come on, let's get
started. Are we married?

26
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:48,903
<i>- I'm separated.
- Then there is a God.</i>

27
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,509
Let's try something a little special.
Try these on, Timmy.

28
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,245
Ooh, yeah. Chic in the sun, yeah.

29
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,182
Take that drink right there.

30
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:01,949
Yeah, that looks like fun, hm?

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,425
To me, this is an incredible shot.

32
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:08,098
OK, I can see you're not impressed.
And you're right. I hate it too.

33
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,225
Your kid is more hip,
more now, more '80s.

34
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,770
Let's try this right here.
Now get ready.

35
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,034
Hold on. I'm crazy about this one.
Your own baby Jedi.

36
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:20,705
This is terrific. You're gonna
like this. Huh? Huh? Huh?

37
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:25,445
All right, you're not
into science fiction. OK.

38
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:29,318
Oh! Mrs Klupner, why
didn't I see this before?

39
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:32,392
Why don't you lean into the
picture with your child?

40
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,653
Oh, yes, yes.

41
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,063
Yes, yes, yes.

42
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,997
Lean in a little more.

43
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:43,730
If I was that kid, I would
breast-feed until I was 17 or 18.

44
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,741
OK. Now hold that
pose, Mrs Klupner.

45
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:57,986
Timmy, why don't you go to sleep?
There we go. Good boy. There we go.

46
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,032
Raul!

47
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,330
Who the hell put this
shit in my beer cooler?!

48
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,832
Jesus Christ!

49
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,839
Stupid people!

50
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,137
I gotta change the oil.

51
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,246
Hey!

52
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,545
Rudy! Here, boy! Hey, Rudy!

53
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,452
Oh, shit! I don't believe this!

54
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:00,658
Guys, this is the problem
with American cars!

55
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:06,062
Help me put this crap together
and we'll get outta here.

56
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,543
The Police concert's sold out?
My customers are gonna kill me!

57
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,774
Screw that!

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,710
Screw Sting!

59
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,714
- Hi, guys. How's it goin'?
- How are you, you animal?

60
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,286
Great. I'm a dead man.

61
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,482
Hello. Concert Tickets.

62
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,251
What?

63
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,421
You're kiddin'! Boy George
has a yeast infection?!

64
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,591
He's canceling?! You know
what this is gonna cost me?!

65
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,796
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't call me again, OK?

66
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,801
Let's get outta here.

67
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:44,811
I told you not to call me again!
You're full of shit! Eat my...

68
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:48,313
Oh, hi, Mom. No, no, no.
I didn't know it was you.

69
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,249
Right. Eggs and milk.

70
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:53,082
Ma... Ma, I'll talk to you later.

71
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:57,357
- This better be important.
- This guy gets along with everybody.

72
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:58,985
Oh, yeah. A real diplomat.

73
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:02,423
Eat me.

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,161
I love it when he talks like that!

75
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:09,770
- We'd like to order now.
- Hey, no sweat. No sweat, guys.

76
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,571
You wanna order?

77
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,212
Here's today's deals. OK?

78
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:17,375
OK, we got veal.

79
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,152
We got veal... Par...

80
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,122
Veal... Par...

81
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,191
What's this word?

82
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,452
Parmesan.

83
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,089
That's that meat with that cheese
on it. See, I don't eat cheese.

84
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,565
Gives me mucus.
Clogs me up with phlegm.

85
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:37,834
And butter, that's another thing.
Clogs you up with snot.

86
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,500
Please, we're in a hurry.

87
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,572
Ryko, come on, take a break!

88
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:45,678
Hey, be right there, guys.

89
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,981
Hey, keep your slimy paws out of my
food, man. Order your own food.

90
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,714
I hope you choke, you animal.

91
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,023
Hey!

92
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,628
Get outta here.

93
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:02,463
All right, OK, now we're all here.
So what's the big announcement?

94
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,999
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna beat
around the bush on this thing.

95
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,873
We've known each other
since grade school,

96
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,605
so I'm gonna give this to
ya right from the hip.

97
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:17,184
I mean, it's gonna come
straight from the old shoulder.

98
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,822
I mean, no fancy
stuff or anything...

99
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,786
Come on, Rick!

100
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,088
All right. OK. All right,
all right, all right. This is it.

101
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,129
- I'm gettin' married.
- Yeah, right, yeah.

102
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,507
That was not a joke, guys!

103
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:48,417
A week from this Saturday, I turn in
my amateur standing and I... I go pro.

104
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:50,853
- I don't believe it.
- Come on!

105
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,356
Fuck me!

106
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,654
Well, thanks for tellin' us, man.

107
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,696
Guys!

108
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,301
Guys!

109
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:10,771
Guys!

110
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,647
Our buddy is gettin' married.

111
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:19,551
This is the happiest moment of his life
and you guys are giving him a hard time.

112
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:23,627
You guys should be ashamed of
yourselves. Congratulations, buddy.

113
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,561
Come on, guys!

114
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:33,867
Look, Rick, I'd rather be dead. But if
this is what you want, good luck, man.

115
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:37,768
All the best. It should
happen to me, man.

116
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:42,014
Since you're gonna do this...

117
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,312
- You really are gonna do this?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,752
At least we can make sure
you go out in style.

119
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,951
Let's have a bachelor party, with
chicks and guns and fire trucks

120
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:52,892
and hookers and drugs and booze...

121
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,693
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All the things
that make life worth living for!

122
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,228
Speech! Speech!

123
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,165
All right, all right.

124
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,839
I want you to know
that this marriage

125
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:12,041
is not in any way gonna jeopardize my
relationship with my pals, damn it.

126
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,915
We're still gonna go bowling
every Tuesday night.

127
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,523
Still gonna play cards
every Friday night.

128
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:21,321
And wear each other's underwear every
Sunday. Nothing is gonna change!

129
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,090
I love you guys and I always will.

130
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:28,000
- Hey, a toast!
- To Rick and Debbie.

131
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,198
To us.

132
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,067
To girls with big tits.

133
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,908
Good point! Good point! Good point.

134
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,436
- Excuse me...
- What?

135
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:09,880
- I'd like to pay for this.
- Could you wait till the song is over?

136
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, sure. No problem.

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,885
Excuse me.

138
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:23,727
- Where can I try on these pants?
- Right over there. Can I take these for you?

139
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:29,237
You'll really like these. I have a couple
of pairs myself. They fit very nice.

140
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,618
Phoebe?

141
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:50,021
I don't think your brother did such a good
job of fixing the dressing-room doors.

142
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,326
What do you mean? They look great!

143
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,463
- You don't see a problem here?
- Not really.

144
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,503
No? Maybe it's just me.

145
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,007
Debbie, I don't believe you!

146
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,879
I am your friend and you
don't even tell me!

147
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:11,283
Bobbi, what is going on?

148
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:14,948
I just heard from O'Neill.
Oh, God, I'm so excited!

149
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,493
- What's happening?
- Debbie's marrying Rick!

150
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,995
- Really?
- Really.

151
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:21,189
Oh, my gosh!

152
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,096
Oh, my gosh! You're
actually marrying Rick!

153
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:30,309
- Wait a minute. Does Cole know about this?
- You went with him for two years!

154
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:32,776
No. And he won't leave me alone.

155
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,913
And your parents can't be
too thrilled about this.

156
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,679
No, as far as they're concerned,
the only good Rick is a dead Rick.

157
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,250
But I've made my decision,
and we're gonna do it.

158
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,887
I don't believe it!
Mrs Rick Gassko!

159
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,691
You're getting married...

160
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:53,997
Seems like only yesterday I
showed ya how to give a blow job.

161
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:02,144
I'll give you a
different kind of high

162
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,918
No, I'm not like the
rest of the boys

163
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,912
I'm from Decatur, Illinois

164
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,562
And I am suave, debonair

165
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:20,898
I got this boss,
curly dark black hair

166
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:26,334
And I like how you run... baby!

167
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:30,438
Because you never say maybe

168
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:33,173
I like you...

169
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,041
Oh, shit!

170
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,521
Well, hey, the meal is just about
ready, so it's time for spice...

171
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,532
Yes, it's spice time,
and the lucky spice is...

172
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,397
Paprika!

173
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,439
Thank you, thank you, thank you! You've
made me the happiest spice in the world!

174
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,739
It's a veritable UN for dinner
here, so Swedish meatballs!

175
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,544
Ah! Vino!

176
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:09,748
A little vino... would be keeno!

177
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,251
I want some wine!

178
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,161
Now...

179
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,665
What meal would be complete
without a little dead meat?

180
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:22,533
Yes, America's favorite food:
Dead animal flesh.

181
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:29,041
All the burners are occupied at this time,
so I'm just gonna have to improvise here.

182
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:33,075
- Hi, babe!
- Hi!

183
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:43,856
- What are you doing?
- Just welding up a little dinner, that's all.

184
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,725
It's you!

185
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:56,342
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

186
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:02,248
- God, you're a slob!
- Yeah, but I'm a fabulous cook.

187
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:05,149
Yeah? And what are we having?

188
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:09,724
Well, it's either Swiss steak, meat loaf...
I dunno. Charred flesh of some sort.

189
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,160
<i>- Why don't we name it after we eat?
- Good idea.</i>

190
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,564
Mr Chef? Your
vegetables are on fire.

191
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:23,741
Oh! Hey! It's OK. It's all right. It's
broccoli flambé. It's supposed to do that.

192
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:29,975
Just a little tricky, that's all. Guess I put
in a little too much nuclear waste, huh?

193
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,284
- Wanna hear something great?
- You betcha.

194
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:36,949
Bobbi and Phoebe are gonna throw me
a shower. It's gonna be so much fun!

195
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:41,629
Not as much fun as the bachelor party
the guys are gonna throw for me.

196
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,529
I hope you like potato salad.
It's chunky style, my favorite.

197
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:48,796
- You're gonna have a bachelor party?
- Sure! You bet!

198
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:53,240
Hey, it's a traditional event,
and I am a traditional kinda guy.

199
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,510
How about this? Does
this look great or what?

200
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,450
- It looks awful.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

201
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,788
Not in this case, however.

202
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:13,192
Nope, this is definitely the food
that prison riots are made of.

203
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,800
Are we gonna have
girls at our party?

204
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,365
Well...

205
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:26,675
No, it's a stag party, and that
means that does stay home.

206
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:32,082
I'm not talking about does.
I'm talking about hookers.

207
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,746
Ohhh! Those!

208
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,554
What do you mean?

209
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:43,098
I mean, like, from what I hear, it's a
tradition. And you're a traditional guy.

210
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:48,532
Come here, you little vixen. I'm gonna
set you straight about something.

211
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:52,202
Women mean nothing to me, and that
is why I am so in love with you.

212
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:57,142
Do you understand what I'm saying?

213
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,186
I need you to promise me.

214
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,851
OK. OK. I promise. You got it.

215
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, I... I know a way
that we can seal this bargain.

216
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,340
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

217
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,443
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait!

218
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:29,110
I got a surprise for ya! And I
think you're really gonna like it!

219
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:32,655
Aw, come on, honey!
We'll take turns!

220
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,859
OK, Ricky. Wanna hold out your arm?

221
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,563
You wouldn't hurt your
own brother, would you?

222
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:49,733
Hey! I've changed my mind! I don't need a
blood test. I'm not even gonna get married.

223
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:54,282
- The wedding is off, chief.
- Bear. Chicken, chicken, chicken!

224
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:02,549
You were always sneaky, Stan.
You were always very, very sneaky.

225
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,590
Hey, you ready for this big party?

226
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:10,530
I understand that the guys have some
fascinating women lined up for you.

227
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,293
A bevy of...

228
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,840
Keep your voice down. I've got
the wife in the other room.

229
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,104
Uh, Stan...

230
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,649
Stan, is this supposed
to be like this?

231
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,950
No, that's incorrect.

232
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,557
Oh.

233
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:35,692
I can't understand
you getting married.

234
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,358
Do you have any idea what you're
giving up? Any idea? An inkling?

235
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:43,095
Everything! Wild parties.
Running around like a maniac.

236
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,797
Women every night. Nakedness. Gone!

237
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,000
I miss that so much, Ricky.

238
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,444
Stan, you're beginning
to depress me.

239
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:55,142
Oh, well, maybe you'll feel just
a little better after this.

240
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,821
Easy. Easy. And hold.

241
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:01,449
Oh, that's a fair trade.
A cotton ball for all my blood.

242
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:04,154
OK, Ricky, all finished.

243
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,364
Hey, I'm really looking forward
to this bachelor party.

244
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,667
Whatever you do, you don't say
nothin' to Tina, OK? She'll kill me.

245
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,271
- Who don't you say nothin' to?
- Tina?

246
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,037
Tina. OK.

247
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:22,478
Don't screw me up. I told her I'm
going to a plasma convention.

248
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,176
Oh, well, that's brilliant.

249
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,854
Hi, Tina!

250
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:32,454
Rick! Mr Goldsmith, this is my
brother-in-law. He's getting married.

251
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:34,821
Congratulations.

252
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,232
Nurse, take over.

253
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,835
I am so happy for you!

254
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,231
That's great. I'm glad. Thanks.

255
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,071
Listen, I gotta run. I gotta make
sure the guys have got the hookers!

256
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,341
- Hookers?
- He didn't say hookers.

257
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:53,475
- Did I say hookers? I didn't mean...
- You said hookers.

258
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,419
He didn't say hookers.
I'm walking Ricky out.

259
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:01,221
You had to open your mouth. You had to
say something. You had to say hookers!

260
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:05,163
- Doc, I'll pay my bill! Don't hurt me, please!
- I'll kill you!

261
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:10,932
I'll pull out your lights!
I'll rip out your guts!

262
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:14,770
I'll break you in half! Now
shut up and get outta here!

263
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,970
OK. All right.

264
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,646
Oh, listen. I'll see ya
Saturday for the...?

265
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,842
Out!

266
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,726
Mrs Phillips. You're next.

267
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:45,706
- OK, who serves?
- Your turn, Dad.

268
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,362
It's long, it's to the fence,
it's to the wall! It's gone!

269
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,765
- Rick!
- Yep.

270
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,937
Hit the ball easier, son.
You don't have to kill it.

271
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,073
Uh... maybe we should go in now.

272
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,307
No. We will at least
finish this set.

273
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,814
- Ready?
- Yo!

274
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,028
Yes! Cleveland wins the pennant!

275
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:44,508
One of these days, I'm gonna burn the
Thompson court right to the ground.

276
00:20:48,118 --> 00:20:53,455
I gotta admit my tennis is a little
rusty, but polo... There's a game, eh?

277
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:56,752
Unrelenting, constant
challenge to the senses.

278
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:59,262
A beautiful, manly experience.

279
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:03,425
Rick, I want to cut through the BS.

280
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,032
- I'd like that.
- Good.

281
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:10,039
I think you're an asshole.

282
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,737
No, let me correct that.
An immature asshole.

283
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:17,610
Which is fine, except that
you're marrying my daughter

284
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:21,845
and I'm afraid that my grandchildren
are gonna be little assholes.

285
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:24,188
- Mr Thompson, I...
- No, let me finish.

286
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,621
Debbie is an adult. She
can do what she wants.

287
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:32,994
But if you want your marriage to last, you
have to change some things about yourself.

288
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:37,001
- Now, if I may make some suggestions?
- Oh, feel free.

289
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:39,837
Good. First, you're a slob.

290
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,103
You dress like a bum.

291
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,681
Second, you're unmotivated.

292
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,720
You have no self-esteem,
no thought about the future.

293
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,320
You're inconsiderate. You're
insensitive. You're insincere.

294
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:58,729
I'm having the same caterer for your shower
that we had at our Christmas party last year.

295
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,060
That'd be great! They're wonderful!

296
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:06,072
If I were you, I'd worry less about the
shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.

297
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:09,835
Why...? Why would I want
to do that? I trust Rick.

298
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:14,109
Oh, of course you do. And I
trusted my ex, Kevin, too.

299
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:17,781
Cousin, I can only speak
to you from experience.

300
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:20,480
But what do you think happens
at bachelor parties?

301
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:23,622
Think they drink tea
and play Scrabble?

302
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,921
Ilene, I trust Rick. He promised...

303
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:29,330
Debbie, please! Don't be naive.
Men are pigs.

304
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:34,132
Girls, why don't we go
inside and have some lunch?

305
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:38,208
Boys! Come on inside
and have lunch!

306
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:40,570
In a second.

307
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,515
And you're irresponsible.
A show-off.

308
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,345
You're vulgar.
You're inappropriate.

309
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:52,123
You're unrefined. You're obnoxious.

310
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:57,793
Well, Mr Thompson, that's really quite a list.
And you're right. You're absolutely right.

311
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:01,301
And I think,
if I really apply myself,

312
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:05,967
I could be a totally changed person
by the time we finish lunch.

313
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:20,289
Rick, we don't have a dog.

314
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:25,228
Oh, too bad. That's a waste of some good fat.
Are you going to eat your potato, darling?

315
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,833
- You want this?
- You betcha.

316
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,732
Yeah, me and Debbie are
gonna have kids right away.

317
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:34,464
I'd like to adopt this 17-year-old
Korean girl I've had my eye on.

318
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:38,443
I figure why beat around the bush,
but, I mean, this pup is fertile,

319
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:41,810
and I know I'm perfectly capable,
so you don't have to worry.

320
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:45,216
You'll have some American
grandkids in no time at all.

321
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:49,388
I tell ya, Mrs T, this is really some
spread. This is pretty good chow.

322
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,323
Usually I just have a
jam sandwich for lunch.

323
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:57,365
Do you know what a jam sandwich is? You take
two pieces of bread, jam 'em together...

324
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,837
- Hello, everybody! Am I late?
- Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

325
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,037
- How are you, Cole?
- Fine, just fine.

326
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,744
Ilene! You're looking very well.

327
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,884
- Mrs Thompson...
- Cole...

328
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,082
Always a pleasure.

329
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:24,623
Debbie...

330
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,167
And, uh...

331
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,203
Bond. James Bond.

332
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:33,607
So, Cole, how's your
game coming along?

333
00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:36,772
- Better and better, sir.
- Good.

334
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,040
I'll take you on.

335
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:42,512
We tried some doubles this
morning but it didn't work out.

336
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,053
Mother, what is Cole doing here?

337
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:49,888
Well, you know your father
enjoys his company.

338
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,260
Oh, he must, if he took time off
from his Hitler Youth rally.

339
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,439
- Good shot!
- Thank you, sir.

340
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:07,709
Cole, I know you're as unhappy as
I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.

341
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,142
Yes, I am, sir.

342
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:16,153
- Son, I don't want you to give up on her.
- I have tried to change her mind.

343
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:21,460
It's not her mind you have to change.
It's Mr Shit For Brains in there.

344
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:26,866
- Yeah, but how can I do that?
- If it were up to me, I'd reason with him first.

345
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:30,701
And if that failed, I'd try
more persuasive action.

346
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:37,081
More... persuasive action?

347
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:44,222
Good... Keep me informed.

348
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:48,886
Goodbye, darling.

349
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,532
Goodbye, Mom. Thanks for
everything. It was great.

350
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:57,231
- Nice seeing you again, Rick.
- You too, Mrs T. Let's do this every day.

351
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,774
- How about tomorrow? I'll bring weenies.
- Well, I have, uh... club.

352
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:04,381
- What time's it over?
- Uh, Rick. Let's talk.

353
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:08,447
Honey, the boys have
something to discuss.

354
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,487
Let's leave 'em alone
for a minute, huh?

355
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:15,583
If this is about the facts
of life, I got it covered.

356
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,528
- Rick, I want Debbie.
- You do, huh?

357
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:21,256
Yes, I do. You dump her
and I'll give you cash.

358
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:24,563
Well, what's Debbie's Blue
Book value right now?

359
00:26:24,705 --> 00:26:27,139
- $5,000.
- No.

360
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:29,071
- 7500?
- Not interested.

361
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,438
All right, all right, all right.

362
00:26:31,613 --> 00:26:35,606
10,000 plus a GE toaster oven,

363
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:38,346
a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...

364
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:40,546
Cole, read my lips now.

365
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:43,124
I am marrying Debbie.

366
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:45,517
Michelin tyres, brand-new.

367
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,220
A set of Sears' best metric tools.

368
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,932
What's going on?

369
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,530
This big lug is in love and he's got a
lot of major appliances laying around.

370
00:26:56,842 --> 00:27:01,905
Debbie, Cole is just trying to save you
from making a mistake. A big mistake.

371
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:03,907
Oh, Daddy...

372
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,882
Hey, thanks, Dad.
Listen, we gotta go.

373
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:11,386
Debbie! He's gonna hurt you.

374
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:15,120
He'll never be true to
you the way I would.

375
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:20,334
We'll keep that in mind. Cole
Whittier, ladies and gentlemen!

376
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:25,369
A funny, funny guy as well as being
a wonderfully talented human being.

377
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,907
Take care, babe. We love ya.

378
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,974
Hey, Rick! You and I,
we're not through yet.

379
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,537
Hey...

380
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,439
Hey...

381
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:55,700
What?

382
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,902
I can't sleep.

383
00:27:59,147 --> 00:28:01,581
I got something for that.

384
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:12,223
Will you stop fooling around?
I need to talk.

385
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:14,091
What's the matter?

386
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,856
I don't know. I just feel scared.

387
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,864
Oh, baby... What about?

388
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:23,965
Hmm?

389
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:29,503
The wedding. My parents.

390
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,979
Your parents. Our friends.

391
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:33,448
My job.

392
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,985
The future.

393
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,644
Our relationship.

394
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:39,452
The caterers. My gown.

395
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,952
Your tuxedo.

396
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:45,459
The honeymoon. Our apartment.

397
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:47,123
My shower.

398
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,393
Your bachelor party.

399
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:55,134
Well, how about the Middle East?
You all right with that?

400
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,812
Honey, everything is
gonna be all right.

401
00:28:58,014 --> 00:29:01,848
Before or after I have
my nervous breakdown?

402
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:11,358
You are so tense.

403
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,956
Come on.

404
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:18,161
That feels so good.

405
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,833
That's a coincidence.
It's supposed to.

406
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:24,705
Close your eyes. Drift
off to sleep again, OK?

407
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:29,142
It just so happens...
I'm a great guy

408
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:35,381
and, very soon, you're gonna
be Mrs Great Guy, all right?

409
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:22,668
Well, there you go, ma'am.
End of the line. Last stop.

410
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:27,282
I have a great idea. Why don't I just
pal around with you guys for a while?

411
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:33,081
No, no, no. We have some manly things we
have to do, and this is no place for a woman.

412
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,657
- Are you sure you don't want me to go?
- How about "no"?

413
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,854
I don't wanna go!

414
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,733
Remember, you promised
me no screwing around.

415
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:48,101
- I won't! I swear on my mother's grave.
- Your mother's not dead.

416
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:50,709
Well, if I go back on
my word, I'll kill her.

417
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:53,869
Have a good time.

418
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:59,148
Don't have a great time. You catch
my drift, Mr Traditional Guy?

419
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,311
Hmm, yeah, I understand.

420
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:04,654
And you have a
fun shower. Use soap.

421
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:10,924
I love you.

422
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:13,159
And I love you.

423
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,941
Come on, Rick! Party!

424
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,020
Presidents have stayed in
this suite. It's gorgeous!

425
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,586
What presidents?

426
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:41,996
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing. Let's get crazy.

427
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:44,429
Yeah!

428
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:51,406
- When do the girls show up?
- Gary is taking care of that right now.

429
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:59,617
All right. I think I've got
just what you're looking for.

430
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,916
Great.

431
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:02,685
Margot! Darleen!

432
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:06,161
These are twins of pleasure.

433
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:09,924
Wow! Twins!

434
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,031
Great!

435
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:14,034
They're gonna be just fine.
Just fine.

436
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:16,937
Hi, ladies.

437
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:22,379
Maybe after the orgy tonight we can get
together, have a cup of coffee or somethin'?

438
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,043
<i>Thanks, man. We'll see
you girls later. Ciao!</i>

439
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:49,173
Hi!

440
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:51,712
Hi.

441
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,510
Say, I must have just
missed my friend.

442
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:57,450
He hired some of your girls
for a bachelor party?

443
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:02,116
Yeah, Parkview Hotel, room 1002.
What about it?

444
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:06,191
Yeah, right, well, um...
here's the new address.

445
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:10,599
There's been a change of plan. We're
sending the girls to his house instead.

446
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:14,367
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, and, uh... here's a fifty.

447
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,776
Now I want this to be a surprise for
the groom, so you never saw me, OK?

448
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,908
No problem.

449
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:46,207
Move it out, move it out,
move it out!

450
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:53,243
You be careful with that bus.
It's a rental.

451
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:57,485
Was I kidding? Was I kidding?

452
00:33:57,692 --> 00:34:00,024
We who are about to go
apeshit salute you!

453
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,186
We want women!

454
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:07,493
Hold it! Hold it!

455
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,997
Before we move on,
I have a little surprise.

456
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,906
I have flown in someone
dear to all of us.

457
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:18,877
A man who has traveled
over 3,000 miles.

458
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,109
Come on, Rick, let's go.

459
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:25,020
A man whom none of us have
seen since he left town.

460
00:34:27,392 --> 00:34:28,791
Come on, come on!

461
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,624
A man whom we affectionately
call Peckerhead!

462
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:34,289
Oh, my God, our dad is here.

463
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,936
It's your childhood chum
and mine, Brad Mollen!

464
00:34:37,238 --> 00:34:38,034
Brad!

465
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,707
<i>That Peckerhead! Where is he?</i>

466
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:47,170
Guys!

467
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:48,840
Guys!

468
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:51,010
Guys! Guys!

469
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:55,421
For the last time, I'm telling
you to get off of there!

470
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,989
Off! Off!

471
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,355
OK!

472
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,332
Guys!

473
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,128
Holy shit!

474
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,570
Dr Stan!

475
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,300
Hi, Brad.

476
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,173
Rick! Oh, Rick! Rick!

477
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,240
Jay!

478
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:19,611
Rudy!

479
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,619
Diagnosis?

480
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,687
- Medically speaking?
- Yeah.

481
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,223
Whacked out of his brains on drugs.

482
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:29,158
I love you guys! This is great!
This is beautiful!

483
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,831
I love it! I love it!

484
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,091
How you been?

485
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:37,229
Oh, I couldn't be better. This is the best.
This is great. I love this. This is the best.

486
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm having the best time. I love
you guys! I love everybody!

487
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:45,408
- How's your wife?
- I hate her. I hate her guts.

488
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,913
The bitch!

489
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:53,015
I've got this.
You wanna share this?

490
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:56,284
Oh, gee, two on a Quaalude.
That's bad luck.

491
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,429
OK, let's go, guys. Come on, Brad.

492
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:02,125
Listen, you and your wife
got problems, Brad?

493
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:07,035
No. No. Cos I love you guys.
I love my friends. I love everybody!

494
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,832
I just wanna party!

495
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:10,510
Party!

496
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,462
- Just where do you guys think you are?
- The Library of Congress?

497
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,829
- Detroit?
- Beyond the sun?

498
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:34,971
Any of those right?

499
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:38,472
This is the Parkview Hotel.
I am the hotel manager.

500
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:45,477
This is a respectable establishment.
We don't go for any funny business here.

501
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:49,219
So I see. Well, thank you. It's
been very nice talking to you.

502
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:52,450
You're a hell of a guy, and
you're doing a hell of a job.

503
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:07,832
Pamela, you're here! How nice!
Come say hello to our guest of honor.

504
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:12,682
Pamela! Hi, how are you!
Good to see you!

505
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,214
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

506
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,855
Debbie, it's Pamela.

507
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,116
Pamela, how are you?

508
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:24,927
Come sit down and I'll
get you some punch.

509
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:30,960
Mrs Thompson, do you have any more
of this dip? It's, like, really excellent.

510
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:33,035
You just ate Purina Cat Chow.

511
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,673
Oh, it's, like, so good!

512
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,943
And what are you girls
giggling about?

513
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:46,586
- Shall we tell her?
- Yeah.

514
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:51,488
Yesterday we found a bunch of pornos
in the back seat of O'Neill's car.

515
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:56,360
And we made a few changes. I think
the boys will really be interested.

516
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:03,697
Oh, well, good. I hope you ruin
their stag party, the swine!

517
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,634
1003... Aha!

518
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,513
1002.

519
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:15,244
And now, to our honored guest Rick and
his lifelong friends, I say, gentlemen:

520
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,856
Start your boners.

521
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:25,957
Women!

522
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:32,498
Yeah! This is a bitchin' place!

523
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,938
Oh... I am stunned.

524
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,344
I did the balloons myself.

525
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:45,019
Oh, what a clever use of prophylactics.
This is beyond my wildest dreams, guys!

526
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:49,625
- Where's the women? There's no women.
- Rudy, one thing at a time.

527
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,093
<i>Sex is my one thing.
I'm good at it.</i>

528
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,855
OK. What's first?

529
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:58,264
<i>A bit of a warm-up. We spend an
hour with Nymphos Without Pants.</i>

530
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,202
Olivier is in that, right?

531
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:06,107
Then... it's on to the real thing!

532
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,439
OK, Rudy. Screen.

533
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:13,310
It's good to see you, Brad.

534
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:17,892
My marriage sucks. It's all crap.
It's just a big pile of shit!

535
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:23,829
Well, maybe your marriage oughta
lay off the grains for a while.

536
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:28,929
Don't you understand? She hates me.
She hates my guts. It's over!

537
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:33,169
You'll see. As soon as you get
married, everything changes.

538
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,873
Why are you going
through with this?

539
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:38,448
Wait, wait. What do you mean?
What changes?

540
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,346
OK, Ryko, lights!

541
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,744
Lights!

542
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,672
I viewed it yesterday.
Great director, good lighting...

543
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:12,984
Take that off! Take it
off and drive it home!

544
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:18,619
God, this doesn't waste
any time, does it?

545
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,466
Go, baby! Do it, brother! Lay that pipe!
Drive it home, brother!

546
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,478
Hey! What gives?

547
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:38,852
- Did you check this out?
- Kick it! Kick it!

548
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,185
Forget that. This
part's so much better.

549
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:47,351
You guys can't believe... This is a
human being doing this. Watch this.

550
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:50,053
Kiss him all the way down!
All the way down!

551
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:53,902
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

552
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,000
What is this?! What is going on?!

553
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:07,149
I am not complaining, but I usually
don't like my filth this clean.

554
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:09,819
What a waste of two women!

555
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:14,454
I don't get it. The dirty
parts were there yesterday.

556
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:17,062
At least Gary's coming
up with the real thing.

557
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,356
Oh, yeah.

558
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:20,591
Women!

559
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,220
Yes?

560
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,863
Yeah, hi. Is this
1381 Franek Street?

561
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,565
Yes.

562
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:51,794
We're here.

563
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:53,996
How nice.

564
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,403
Um... I'm Dr Tina Gassko.

565
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:00,538
Oh, Tina! Stan's wife!

566
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:03,006
Come in!

567
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:11,050
God, now she's really gonna see what
kind of a jerk-off she's marryin'.

568
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,627
Rick is just gonna
love all of these.

569
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:26,398
Debbie, look, it's Tina.

570
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,044
I think everyone's here now.

571
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,582
Look who's here. It's Tina.

572
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,264
Another one of these, huh?

573
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:51,837
Looks that way.

574
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,303
A buck's a buck.

575
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:54,874
Yep.

576
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:20,464
Ohh!

577
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:32,346
Is there an empty
outlet around here?

578
00:43:36,756 --> 00:43:38,281
Thanks.

579
00:44:19,706 --> 00:44:21,833
God, this is beautiful.

580
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:25,446
She reminds me of my wife.
She was so young when we met.

581
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:27,939
Bitch!

582
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:33,281
Hi, guys, how's it goin'?

583
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:36,050
Get him! Get him, get him, get him!

584
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:42,761
Everybody back! To a
neutral corner, please.

585
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,800
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing's goin' on!

586
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:50,106
Would you get that
animal off of me?

587
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:53,108
This place should be
wall-to-wall tits by now.

588
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:55,746
Guy paints a beautiful picture.

589
00:44:56,114 --> 00:45:00,279
All right! All right! I'll
find out what's goin' on.

590
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:03,852
Looks like the only guy
who got screwed was you.

591
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:05,080
Hey, screw you.

592
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:06,955
Should! Should!

593
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:08,025
Should!

594
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:10,493
I can't believe my
money's been wasted.

595
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:13,031
So, what do you guys think
of the party so far?

596
00:45:14,135 --> 00:45:16,160
All right. OK.

597
00:45:18,107 --> 00:45:21,508
I think the man has done a very
good job with the party so far.

598
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,703
All right, maybe not.

599
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:30,245
Rick, I wanna talk to you.

600
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:32,480
Hey, it's Cole!

601
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:37,023
Did anyone order an asshole
from room service?

602
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,927
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- Oh, come on, just a little.

603
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:46,070
- Rick, I want to make you another deal.
- Oh, be still, my heart!

604
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:48,672
Out the window is something
I wanna show you.

605
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:53,576
Out the window? Oh, this is gonna be
a surprise. I'm a nut for surprises.

606
00:45:55,383 --> 00:45:57,181
You see that out there?

607
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:00,253
That, Rick, is my most
prized possession.

608
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:02,082
That's my new Porsche.

609
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:03,885
Wow!

610
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,652
Guys, can you see that car?

611
00:46:05,828 --> 00:46:09,161
Oh, that's beautiful! What a car!

612
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,063
Rudy, isn't that a beautiful car?

613
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,966
Yeah.

614
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,700
Oh, yeah! That's a
beautiful car, Rick.

615
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:22,369
Hey, guys, excuse me.
I gotta go shake the weasel.

616
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,242
- It's a great car.
- Oh, the best!

617
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:30,584
- God, I love that car.
- I am very, very happy... for the two of you.

618
00:46:30,757 --> 00:46:32,486
Chips?

619
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:37,427
Listen, Rick, I'm willing to trade you my
new Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.

620
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:40,760
Oh, Cole! A car for Debbie?

621
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:44,662
I mean it, Rick. All you
have to do is dump Debbie.

622
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:49,403
Oh! Oh, Cole! This is perplexing.
What an intriguing offer you've made.

623
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:53,605
Guys, what should I do? Should I take
the car, or should I take Debbie?

624
00:46:53,717 --> 00:46:55,981
- Debbie.
- The car.

625
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,348
Depends on mileage.

626
00:46:57,488 --> 00:47:00,821
- The Porsche! The car!
- Take Debbie... The car!

627
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,372
- Debbie! Debbie!
- The car!

628
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:20,943
What a decision
I have to make here.

629
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:23,575
I would hate to be
in your shoes, pal.

630
00:47:23,752 --> 00:47:27,381
- Low mileage. It handles like a dream.
- Well, so does Debbie.

631
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:31,424
I just got that car two months ago.
It's got everything, it's got...

632
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:33,026
Shit.

633
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:35,460
Shit! Shit! Shit!

634
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:39,166
- Something amiss?
- My car is gone!

635
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:40,927
Maybe it had something to do.

636
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:42,264
You know...

637
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:45,500
If I don't get my car back,
you're dead, mister!

638
00:47:50,883 --> 00:47:53,716
Gone just a few seconds
and I miss him already.

639
00:47:56,488 --> 00:47:59,720
Isn't it childish getting
revenge on the guys like this?

640
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,490
You heard what those hookers said. They
were supposed to go to a bachelor party.

641
00:48:04,698 --> 00:48:06,825
That doesn't mean it
was Rick's party.

642
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,333
Good evening, ladies. Follow me.

643
00:48:09,737 --> 00:48:12,229
Go on. Just don't touch anything.

644
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,273
God, look at those guys!
What a hunk!

645
00:48:16,745 --> 00:48:19,214
Look at that guy's buns!

646
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:24,478
Come on, Mom.

647
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:26,246
Debbie, I don't know about this.

648
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:30,120
Mom, come on, we'll have a great time.
You might even get lucky.

649
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,852
Debbie!

650
00:48:47,747 --> 00:48:50,215
Is there a Rick Gassko
registered there?

651
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:59,689
Hold it! It's not Gary.
It's Michael.

652
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:01,288
I don't believe it!

653
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,729
I may as well have left
my genitals at home!

654
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:06,062
Michael, when are you comin' over?

655
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:08,594
Right after work.

656
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:12,607
Guess what, buddy? Debbie and
her friends just walked in here.

657
00:49:12,977 --> 00:49:16,435
No kidding! Well,
that's interesting.

658
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:21,818
Michael, hang around down there for
a while. We're gonna come down.

659
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:23,386
Yeah. Bye.

660
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,081
Guys, we are going
out for some air.

661
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:29,589
Some air?

662
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:31,788
- Where are we going?
- Out.

663
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,828
I love going out.

664
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:37,061
Rick, I don't think I wanna go.

665
00:49:37,205 --> 00:49:39,230
Come on, Brad,
it'll be good for ya.

666
00:49:39,574 --> 00:49:42,372
No... I just wanna be alone.

667
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:49,375
Well... all right, but do your homework,
and you can watch TV for a half-hour,

668
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,679
but then straight
to bed, young man.

669
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,355
OK.

670
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:02,427
Come on, just stay with me, guys.
When a night gets dull, call in a pro.

671
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:10,098
Al, how are you?

672
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:13,474
Ed, we're so glad you could
come at the last minute

673
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:15,773
and fill in as our keynote speaker.

674
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:18,714
It's a pleasure, Al.
I'm always glad to help out.

675
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:21,911
I should call my service.
Is there a phone I can use?

676
00:50:22,056 --> 00:50:24,184
- Yeah, right there.
- Thank you.

677
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:28,557
Ed, this is the biggest turnout we've
ever had. Hey, this is our mascot.

678
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:30,393
Hiya, fellas!

679
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:34,969
We've had some big speakers, but no
one with your marketing experience.

680
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:39,472
I just wanna let 'em know where I am.
I'm expecting an important phone call.

681
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:44,071
I had to get out of the house anyway.
My daughter's having a bridal shower.

682
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:26,061
I'm a doctor! I can't do this!

683
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,267
- Will your friend do this?
- He'll do anything for money.

684
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:40,174
I love that attitude!

685
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:43,576
- Are they still out there?
- I'll check. Wait.

686
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:54,987
I don't believe this!

687
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:05,733
What does she think she's doing?

688
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:07,967
Maybe checking him for a hernia.

689
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:11,906
Oh, it's amusing?

690
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,642
- It's amusing.
- What now?

691
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:18,119
It's action they want? Well,
we're the guys to give it to 'em.

692
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:20,315
Eh, me hearties?

693
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:26,053
Guys, this is Chippendales'
star attraction.

694
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:30,996
Mr Nicholas, better
known as Nick the Dick.

695
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:33,100
Nick the what?

696
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:35,332
The Dick.

697
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,146
Oh-ho! Wow!

698
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:49,617
I was impressed when they
opened the World Trade Center,

699
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:52,354
but this is a piece of work!

700
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:56,224
Well, let's get this thing going.
Tray, please, Michael.

701
00:52:58,936 --> 00:53:00,426
Bun.

702
00:53:01,272 --> 00:53:03,467
Oh, well now, this is good.

703
00:53:03,674 --> 00:53:06,075
OK, Nick, or is it Mr Dick?

704
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:08,877
Nick.

705
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:11,209
You wanna do the honors?

706
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,586
- It's up to you.
- Gentlemen.

707
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,624
This is gonna be great!

708
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:37,714
Here's your orders, ladies.
You can help yourselves.

709
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:54,397
Is that the foot-long?

710
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:56,558
And then some.

711
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:25,192
Excuse us. Mom, let go.

712
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:53,157
Hey, lady, how much?

713
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,761
Talk to the pimp.

714
00:54:56,938 --> 00:54:57,928
Hi.

715
00:54:58,374 --> 00:54:59,432
Hi.

716
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,065
Hey, nice seeing you.

717
00:55:01,243 --> 00:55:02,608
Hello.

718
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:06,372
Hey, let's talk.

719
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,316
Hey, bro! What it be?

720
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:13,984
- You're a pimp? You look like Gandhi.
- I'm telling you I am, Joe.

721
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:16,218
- I want women.
- I got women.

722
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,795
They sit on your face,
anything you want.

723
00:55:18,997 --> 00:55:21,022
Great. I want some. How much?

724
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,859
Big hassle now, bro.
Soon they go to customers.

725
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:28,369
I got a bachelor party
at the Parkview Hotel.

726
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:31,103
That would be out of sight, dude.

727
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:33,610
Customers in same hotel.

728
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:38,014
Let you have them at cut-rate
price for 45 minutes.

729
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:40,916
- $200.
- Great.

730
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,523
Sold. 45 minutes, no problem.

731
00:55:43,658 --> 00:55:44,990
Room 1002.

732
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:48,560
Not one minute longer or
Milt will come for you.

733
00:55:48,698 --> 00:55:50,222
Milt?

734
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,163
This being Milt.

735
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:56,696
Pretty heavy, hey, dude?

736
00:56:01,646 --> 00:56:04,081
Girls back in 45 minutes

737
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:07,246
or Milt cuts your balls off.

738
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:08,886
Fair enough?

739
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:10,420
Shake.

740
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:20,332
I just bet my balls,
and shook on it.

741
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:26,035
Did you happen to see Tina's face?

742
00:56:26,274 --> 00:56:31,144
Bobbi was less shocked, of course.
She's used to seeing something that size.

743
00:56:32,448 --> 00:56:34,313
Hey, yo! Brad!

744
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:37,744
Hey! Big Brad!

745
00:56:40,057 --> 00:56:41,684
Where's the young man?

746
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,965
What are you doing?

747
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:54,230
I'm killing myself.

748
00:56:54,807 --> 00:56:56,240
Oh.

749
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,754
You know, Brad, marriage
is a dicey thing at best.

750
00:57:07,922 --> 00:57:10,619
And sometimes people say
things they don't mean.

751
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:14,524
But you and Sue, you're mature people.
You'll work this stuff out.

752
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,758
- You gotta lighten up, man.
- No, Rick, I don't care any more!

753
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:24,102
She hates me! I'm no good for her.
I'm just gonna end it all right here!

754
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,240
Oh! Oh! God!

755
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,413
Are you all right?

756
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:35,677
Yeah.

757
00:57:36,555 --> 00:57:39,116
Pain is such a rush.

758
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:42,918
Oh, this is good.

759
00:57:43,062 --> 00:57:46,464
- Is there anything I can do for ya?
- Oh, no...

760
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:49,759
This is pain.

761
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,396
Fabulous.

762
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,368
There could be some
major damage here.

763
00:57:59,982 --> 00:58:02,576
Mmm! Mmmm!

764
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,764
Hey, man! Go check out
your car. It's beautiful.

765
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:24,704
- My car? Where is it?
- It's outside.

766
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:39,124
Shit!

767
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:43,054
Shit!

768
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,793
Oh, shit!

769
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,994
Shit!

770
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:50,597
Shit!

771
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:53,002
Shit! Shit!

772
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:56,005
Rick, goddamnit!

773
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:59,678
You've had it! I'm gonna get you!

774
00:59:10,362 --> 00:59:11,921
Shit!

775
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:13,656
Shit! Shit!

776
00:59:16,202 --> 00:59:19,730
This is your bachelor party,
and you're not havin' a good time.

777
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:21,636
I'm having a great time!

778
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:24,301
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

779
00:59:24,746 --> 00:59:27,146
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I don't know.

780
00:59:27,282 --> 00:59:29,307
Surprise!

781
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:32,287
The team bus just pulled in!

782
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:40,058
Hookers!

783
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:42,859
It's a party! Party, Ricky!

784
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,037
I had a wiener right in my hand.

785
00:59:56,182 --> 01:00:00,916
I told you, men are pigs. I saw
those swine just standing there.

786
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:03,588
God! What a gross thing to do.

787
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:07,626
I have to admit, even for Rick, that
was beyond the Valley of Good Taste.

788
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:11,960
Yeah, well, Rick and his pals are
probably knee-deep in whores by now.

789
01:00:12,134 --> 01:00:14,898
- I can't wait to see what those guys are up to.
- Me either.

790
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,729
If I find out Stanley's been
screwing around, I'll kill him.

791
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:23,403
Kill? I won't do anything that drastic.
I just won't get married.

792
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,106
Good. You're finally
talking some sense.

793
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,583
Well... let's get ready,
you guys. Let's get going.

794
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:34,215
- You with us, Mom?
- A strange wang right in my palm.

795
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:39,726
- Can I help you?
- We're the band.

796
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:41,594
- Band?
- O'Neill sent us.

797
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:43,564
Oh, O'Neill! Great!

798
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,605
Everybody's busy in the bedrooms
right now, but come on in.

799
01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:51,677
Oh, that's nice hair. I'll try to
make sure no one smokes around you.

800
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:54,872
Are you together? If not, maybe
introductions are in order.

801
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:01,214
Why do good girls like bad boys?

802
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:05,219
Why do good girls like bad boys?

803
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,828
It must be the thrill she gets
When he lights her cigarette

804
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:14,830
Or the way his nostrils flare
Every time he combs his hair

805
01:01:15,273 --> 01:01:17,002
Why do good girls like bad boys?

806
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:25,012
Why do good girls like bad boys?

807
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:28,044
Alligator!

808
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:46,602
Hey, that was incredible.
And also wonderful.

809
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,574
It was a moving experience. I thank you.
From the bottom of my heart.

810
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,808
Next!

811
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:57,712
Ricky! Go, babe.
Get in there, my brother.

812
01:01:58,156 --> 01:02:01,148
My dearest family member,
get in there. She's incredible.

813
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:05,525
No, no, no. I will, but the party's
young and it's just starting up.

814
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:09,930
I want to ask you a question first. You're my
older brother. Let me ask you some advice.

815
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:13,163
You are a married man, right?
I am about to be a married man.

816
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:16,741
What can I expect from this marriage
thing? What is the honest scoop?

817
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:22,076
The honest scoop? The first month, from
the beginning, is terrific. It's great.

818
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:25,744
The second month, things
calm down a little bit.

819
01:02:27,723 --> 01:02:31,785
Third month, you're looking through
old phone numbers, old girlfriends...

820
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:37,367
But, by the fourth month... by the fourth
month you're just... you're numb.

821
01:02:38,169 --> 01:02:40,399
You know? Just... It's incredible.

822
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:44,066
So by the fifth month, hopefully,
football season starts.

823
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:47,542
<i>- Football.
- You got ball games. You got Monday Night.</i>

824
01:02:47,712 --> 01:02:54,118
Stan, I am so glad we had this chat.
You've really answered my questions.

825
01:02:55,788 --> 01:03:00,556
Hi. We were just walking by and we
heard the music. Can we come in?

826
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:04,425
Sure! Come on in!
Join the party, babe.

827
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:15,105
What can I get for 25 bucks?

828
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:19,140
An elevator ride around the block,
a pogo pump, or a pogo swirl,

829
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:21,613
or a pump with an
underground hammer.

830
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:24,846
Wait a minute. Whatever
happened to hand jobs?

831
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,038
Hi.

832
01:03:44,178 --> 01:03:45,873
Hello.

833
01:04:02,832 --> 01:04:04,323
I was dreaming

834
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:05,934
Woke up screaming

835
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:08,094
I was drowning in a pool of sweat

836
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:10,969
My hands were shaking

837
01:04:11,142 --> 01:04:12,700
My head was aching

838
01:04:12,877 --> 01:04:14,902
My stomach was so upset

839
01:04:16,314 --> 01:04:22,652
That's when I saw two
eyes glowing in the dark

840
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:26,490
I fell in love with a little demon

841
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,857
Little demon, little demon

842
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:33,791
Angels above can't
take my little demon

843
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:36,665
Little demon, little demon

844
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,136
Little demon!

845
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,038
She crawled up beside me

846
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,309
Her smile terrified me

847
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,182
And I was suffering in ecstasy

848
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:09,206
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm slashing my wrists.

849
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,107
- With an electric razor?
- I couldn't find any razor blades.

850
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,712
At least your wrists will
be smooth and kissable.

851
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,478
Give me this thing! What
is the matter with you?

852
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:23,954
Will you go out there and have some
fun and have a few laughs, please?

853
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,696
No, no, no. Have fun first,
and then have a few laughs.

854
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:32,697
Just forget about the marriage
for a couple of hours.

855
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:35,996
This is a party, remember?
Go out there and party.

856
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:41,406
That's good. That's good.

857
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:57,760
Gary, how's the big stallion?

858
01:05:58,032 --> 01:06:00,500
Rick, I really think I'm in love.

859
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:06,136
We're talking marriage,
kids, the whole thing.

860
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:11,509
I'm very happy for you. Name your
first six kids after me, OK?

861
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:03,761
My name is Tim.
I'm always available.

862
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:06,535
By the way, I also do
engine work on BMWs.

863
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,305
Bye.

864
01:07:50,928 --> 01:07:54,193
That's another example of better
living through chemistry.

865
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,958
I said that's another example...

866
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:58,898
Are these on or am
I wasting my time?

867
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:12,551
All right!

868
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:15,952
This is gonna be great.

869
01:08:16,156 --> 01:08:18,022
Sex with a donkey. Incredible.

870
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:50,921
Hi! Come on in!

871
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:53,724
Drugs to the right,
hookers to the left.

872
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:59,396
Good to see ya again.

873
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:27,699
Hey! I oughta smack you.

874
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,143
Rick, buddy... pal of mine...

875
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:35,741
- I'm concerned.
- Hey! What about?

876
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:40,249
This is your party! Your bachelor party!
You haven't had sex with anyone yet.

877
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,684
Not true. I had a
bunch of sex tonight.

878
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:46,850
I'm just very fast. You haven't been
able to see me. There...  I had it twice!

879
01:09:46,927 --> 01:09:49,521
Come on. I got something
you can't resist.

880
01:09:49,697 --> 01:09:50,687
You do?

881
01:09:50,832 --> 01:09:52,857
You remember Tracey?

882
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:56,999
Tracey? I am a mortal man, O'Neill.
Of course I remember Tracey.

883
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:59,674
You remember how crazy
she was about you?

884
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:05,179
- Tracey was crazy about me?
- "Oh, Rick, you're so funny!"

885
01:10:05,316 --> 01:10:10,015
I called her and told her that you were
about to be put on the unavailable list.

886
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,213
She decided to come over and
give you a little something.

887
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:15,384
She did?

888
01:10:15,727 --> 01:10:18,720
- Right in there.
- The bedroom? Tracey's in the bedroom?

889
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:19,888
You got it.

890
01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:22,933
- Tracey is in the bedroom?
- Heaven awaits.

891
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,465
O'Neill...

892
01:10:29,743 --> 01:10:33,942
Oh... well, now, O'Neill,
this is a gift I...

893
01:10:34,115 --> 01:10:36,140
You bet.

894
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:39,446
How can I...
how can I turn this down?

895
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:41,113
You can't.

896
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,315
I guess I can't.

897
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:45,957
- Oh, Tracey...?
- Yeah.

898
01:10:48,131 --> 01:10:51,761
Oh, hell, all right. All right, I will.
All right, OK. I will. All right.

899
01:10:51,936 --> 01:10:54,769
If I'm not back in half an
hour, call the paramedics.

900
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:56,167
All right.

901
01:10:56,307 --> 01:10:57,900
That's the old Rick!

902
01:11:06,419 --> 01:11:07,977
Hello?

903
01:11:16,296 --> 01:11:18,322
Oh, eat my chair!

904
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:36,145
Rick, take me, please.

905
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:41,116
Rick, you promised me.

906
01:11:41,259 --> 01:11:44,787
You promised me you wouldn't
make love to anybody else.

907
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:47,789
Go for it! Go for it!

908
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:58,640
Don't go back on your word, Rick.
Be true. Be strong.

909
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,542
Go for it!

910
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:05,280
What, are you nuts? Look at
my tits! They're perfect!

911
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:08,854
Rick, take me, please.

912
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,892
How'd it go?

913
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:20,594
Well, hey... Hey, if she can walk,
I don't know my business, you know?

914
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:26,006
Oh, hey, O'Neill, I just lied. Nothing
happened in there, all right?

915
01:12:26,177 --> 01:12:29,578
I know how much this meant to
ya, but I couldn't do it, OK?

916
01:12:29,714 --> 01:12:32,548
I love Debbie. I made a promise
and I'm crazy about her.

917
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:34,777
Hey, I understand.

918
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:36,813
Don't worry about it.

919
01:12:37,056 --> 01:12:42,290
To tell you the truth, I'm envious. I wish
I had someone who was in my every thought.

920
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:44,956
Somebody I could spend
all my time with.

921
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:48,067
Somebody I could really respect.

922
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:50,831
Hey, look at the
cans on that bimbo.

923
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:07,783
I am looking for this dung
head who took my women.

924
01:14:07,927 --> 01:14:09,792
He's being liar to me.

925
01:14:09,963 --> 01:14:11,693
I want my bitches back.

926
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:31,480
Holy shit! I'm going
to get Milt right now.

927
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:33,816
I'm going to get the
fuck out of here.

928
01:14:40,732 --> 01:14:42,927
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

929
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:45,094
- Well, what is this?
- Got me.

930
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,503
- Well, how about this?
- Still drawing a blank.

931
01:14:52,145 --> 01:14:54,943
- Hey, he look familiar?
- Very.

932
01:14:55,148 --> 01:14:59,313
Get the hookers in a circle. We're
gonna put Cochise out of business.

933
01:15:12,568 --> 01:15:14,593
I can't believe we're doing this.

934
01:15:14,704 --> 01:15:17,503
We are supposed to
be hookers. Act sexy.

935
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,112
If Stanley's there
I'll rip his butt.

936
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:29,583
Stop with this! We're supposed
to be hookers! Act sexy!

937
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,521
- I just wanna find him up there...
- Shut up with that.

938
01:15:34,694 --> 01:15:39,189
Don't tell me to shut up. We don't need
sex, we just have to find the room.

939
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:46,103
You girls is the hookers, right?

940
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,399
Yes, of course we're hookers.

941
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:03,716
- The boss said deliver hookers.
- We are not hookers, you big dumb ape!

942
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:13,094
How dare you!

943
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:21,808
Girls, let's get outta here...

944
01:16:21,981 --> 01:16:24,041
Wonderful!

945
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:35,195
Any of you guys from out of town?

946
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,732
Come on, fellas... Fellas!

947
01:16:47,677 --> 01:16:49,042
Where the hell is he?

948
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:53,406
- It's gotta be on this side.
- No, it's this side.

949
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:00,888
Shit! Shit! Shit!

950
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:03,118
All right, this is it.

951
01:17:03,395 --> 01:17:05,830
Let me fix you up here.
Let's show the gold.

952
01:17:05,965 --> 01:17:07,990
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

953
01:17:09,035 --> 01:17:11,095
OK. Go get him.

954
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:30,518
Make love to me... please?

955
01:17:54,387 --> 01:17:59,519
T minus 3, 2, 1. We have ignition!

956
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:01,819
Kill!

957
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:13,041
We got him now!

958
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:17,170
No! No!

959
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:21,742
You can't do this!

960
01:18:22,286 --> 01:18:25,586
We're just gonna put you in a
safe place until after the party.

961
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:30,325
No, no! Please! Please stop!
Don't! No!

962
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:33,090
Hey! Hey, you guys can't do this!

963
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:36,067
Hey! Hey, come on!

964
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:44,106
Now you stay out of
trouble, young man.

965
01:18:44,245 --> 01:18:45,371
Take care!

966
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,710
I hope you die, you bastard!

967
01:18:47,882 --> 01:18:49,907
Bye!

968
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,353
Hey, you bastards! I'm gonna live!

969
01:18:56,825 --> 01:18:57,850
Aaghhh!

970
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:00,357
Well, here we are.

971
01:19:01,498 --> 01:19:06,368
This is gonna be some night, huh?
Are you ready for this? Are you ready?

972
01:19:08,105 --> 01:19:10,130
Come here.

973
01:19:12,844 --> 01:19:17,407
Look, uh... why don't you make
yourself comfortable, all right?

974
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:22,986
There's a terrific
moon out tonight.

975
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,252
OK, we're here. How do we
get this donkey inside?

976
01:19:57,363 --> 01:19:59,388
I don't know.

977
01:20:00,566 --> 01:20:03,694
You don't know? You had it all
figured out. You had a plan.

978
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:06,431
Well, maybe I did.
I don't know. I forgot.

979
01:20:08,775 --> 01:20:12,439
I'd like to get you on an
operating table, just once.

980
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:17,047
Ha-ha-ha!

981
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:19,016
Ha-ha-ha what?

982
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:21,585
- I got it.
- You got what?

983
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:27,925
You're gonna be OK. Everything's
gonna be fine. Don't worry about it.

984
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:33,093
How about some air? You can take in
some air. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

985
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,932
Take in some air, huh?

986
01:20:38,443 --> 01:20:39,967
Oh, no! Shit!

987
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:44,814
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes.

988
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:56,692
Ohh, God...!

989
01:20:58,433 --> 01:20:59,991
They seemed like nice guys.

990
01:21:00,168 --> 01:21:04,799
- Thanks for your help, Ed. We appreciate it.
- Any time, Al. Good night.

991
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:09,806
Cole?! My God, son, what are
you doing here? What happened?

992
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:13,540
The party's upstairs, sir.
They made me get naked and...

993
01:21:13,683 --> 01:21:14,411
What?

994
01:21:14,617 --> 01:21:18,884
They made me get naked and hung me out
from the window. It was so scary and I fell.

995
01:21:19,056 --> 01:21:21,547
Get a hold of yourself.
What room are they in?

996
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:25,756
- They're on the tenth floor, sir.
- I'm going up there. I'll take care of this.

997
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:29,391
Now you go and get yourself
some clothes. You look awful.

998
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:30,934
Yes, sir.

999
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:39,172
OK, this side 27. This side 17.
Ready? Here we go. Go, go, go!

1000
01:22:00,637 --> 01:22:03,367
How ya doing, everybody?
We brought back a friend.

1001
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:09,639
Gentlemen, ladies, for your
viewing pleasure, meet Max,

1002
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:12,216
the magical, sexual mule!

1003
01:22:13,318 --> 01:22:16,185
A donkey that doesn't
wanna be recognized?

1004
01:22:16,355 --> 01:22:19,416
Something interesting
is gonna happen here.

1005
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:25,525
And here's Max's partner. A gal who doesn't
believe happiness ends with primates.

1006
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,468
The lovely Miss Desiree!

1007
01:23:10,818 --> 01:23:13,514
My God! What are you
people doing in here?!

1008
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:16,747
Uh-oh. It's Mr Laughs.

1009
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:25,231
Rick, I knew you were a vile,
disgusting degenerate,

1010
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,562
but bestiality?

1011
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,434
This goes beyond my wildest dreams.

1012
01:23:30,607 --> 01:23:33,008
Well, I like to stretch
myself on occasion.

1013
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:40,746
You're through, mister. When Debbie hears
about this, she will never see you again.

1014
01:23:41,052 --> 01:23:42,849
You're right, Mr Thompson.

1015
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:48,187
You should go give Debbie a call right now.
There's a phone in the back bedroom.

1016
01:23:51,798 --> 01:23:53,823
You're through, mister.

1017
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:57,064
Well, thanks, pal!

1018
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:00,071
If Debbie finds out
about this, I am dead!

1019
01:24:00,241 --> 01:24:03,802
Will you relax?! I have
everything under control.

1020
01:24:04,246 --> 01:24:06,806
Hired help... ladies... follow me.

1021
01:24:20,031 --> 01:24:24,196
Sorry for the interruption, folks.
We now return you to the arts.

1022
01:25:46,764 --> 01:25:49,062
Stand back! I'm a doctor!

1023
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,188
Back!

1024
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:03,637
Of course we don't allow that
sort of thing here, ma'am. No.

1025
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:08,346
I'm sorry that the noise woke you up.
I will take care of it right away.

1026
01:26:09,022 --> 01:26:11,082
I've had enough of this.

1027
01:26:25,608 --> 01:26:28,372
- Let's just give 'em what they want.
- What?!

1028
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:31,103
Let's go. Come on,
everybody inside!

1029
01:26:31,248 --> 01:26:34,706
The big show's gonna start
in one minute. Come on!

1030
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,016
We're gonna have so much fun!

1031
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:44,823
Get outta here! Go! Go!

1032
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:48,930
Everyone, go! I'll hold them off.
The rest of you make a break for it.

1033
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:51,366
Ilene, are you crazy?
Come on, let's go!

1034
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:55,670
Debbie, please, I know what
I'm doing. Now just go. Go!

1035
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:07,122
OK, gentlemen, the gods
have answered your prayers!

1036
01:27:07,857 --> 01:27:09,324
Banzai!

1037
01:27:19,837 --> 01:27:24,001
<i>- I hope Ilene is all right.
- I hope those guys are all right.</i>

1038
01:27:25,744 --> 01:27:27,905
- Oh, my God.
- Ohhh!

1039
01:27:28,046 --> 01:27:29,604
Gross!

1040
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:39,818
1002.

1041
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,451
Guess who's here?
Another surprise guest.

1042
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,484
Who?

1043
01:28:32,754 --> 01:28:35,518
Does the name Debbie
mean anything to you?

1044
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,523
What, my Debbie?

1045
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:42,291
- What's with the costume?
- I don't know! Listen, do me a favor.

1046
01:28:42,365 --> 01:28:46,200
Go up to her like you don't know her
and send her into the back bedroom.

1047
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,133
You got it.

1048
01:28:51,376 --> 01:28:54,470
Hi, baby. You're new here.

1049
01:28:55,714 --> 01:29:00,175
- I don't believe the groom has had you yet.
- No, not...

1050
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:04,819
No, not yet. Where is the groom?

1051
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:06,819
In the bedroom.

1052
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:08,552
Thanks.

1053
01:29:24,881 --> 01:29:27,008
Hey, it's dark in here.

1054
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:31,247
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
I'll lead you around.

1055
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:35,189
Oh, well, a seeing-eye hooker.
This is a nice service.

1056
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:41,193
Hey, you don't look half bad! Let's
see how you are in the sack! Yeehah!

1057
01:29:45,638 --> 01:29:47,128
Damn you, Rick!

1058
01:29:53,213 --> 01:29:55,647
Debbie, you're a hooker!
I don't believe it!

1059
01:29:55,783 --> 01:29:57,479
I can't trust you!

1060
01:29:58,853 --> 01:30:00,480
Come on. I knew it was you.

1061
01:30:03,324 --> 01:30:04,018
Hey!

1062
01:30:04,226 --> 01:30:08,094
- Rick, you're lying!
- It was a joke! Debbie!

1063
01:30:10,466 --> 01:30:13,027
Wait! Just hold on! Wait!

1064
01:30:13,236 --> 01:30:16,103
Hold on! Please, just give
me a chance to explain!

1065
01:30:16,306 --> 01:30:17,295
Debbie!

1066
01:30:17,742 --> 01:30:18,606
Debbie!

1067
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,142
Debbie, I didn't do anything!

1068
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:22,507
Well, hardly.

1069
01:30:22,647 --> 01:30:27,517
The marriage is off! You can screw around
with your friends for the rest of your life!

1070
01:30:27,686 --> 01:30:29,813
I don't want that! I want you!

1071
01:30:29,955 --> 01:30:32,618
And I want somebody who
understands commitment!

1072
01:30:32,826 --> 01:30:35,351
I understand commitment!
I love you!

1073
01:30:35,495 --> 01:30:38,897
- I don't believe you.
- You don't? Oh, fine. Good.

1074
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,226
Hey! Hey!

1075
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,427
People! Attention, please!

1076
01:30:42,536 --> 01:30:44,026
Shut up!

1077
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,642
Have I had sex with anyone
in this room tonight?

1078
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:51,871
No!

1079
01:30:52,548 --> 01:30:54,914
You're sure about this?

1080
01:30:55,151 --> 01:30:57,210
Yes!

1081
01:30:57,855 --> 01:31:00,449
Fine, good. Resume party.

1082
01:31:04,162 --> 01:31:05,322
Understand?

1083
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:10,024
Now this isn't your ordinary party crowd
here. There are professionals in here.

1084
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:12,228
But I didn't want them.

1085
01:31:12,338 --> 01:31:15,102
You... you're the only
one I've ever wanted.

1086
01:31:17,276 --> 01:31:19,040
Do you understand?

1087
01:31:19,212 --> 01:31:20,770
Yeah.

1088
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,560
So what do we do about it?

1089
01:31:35,697 --> 01:31:37,255
Let's get naked.

1090
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:39,292
OK.

1091
01:31:44,642 --> 01:31:46,473
No, Debbie, not that bedroom!

1092
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,846
Daddy?

1093
01:31:52,117 --> 01:31:56,986
All my years as a photographer, I've never
seen such a natural. The camera loves him!

1094
01:31:57,189 --> 01:31:58,555
Grrrrrr!

1095
01:31:59,826 --> 01:32:01,953
Daddy, what are you doing here?

1096
01:32:06,633 --> 01:32:10,730
He says he's having a wonderful time and
thinking of changing his name to Spike.

1097
01:32:11,206 --> 01:32:12,571
Grrrrr!

1098
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:17,502
I've been getting calls all night. God
only knows what they're doing in there.

1099
01:32:17,613 --> 01:32:19,171
Open up! You're under arrest!

1100
01:32:22,017 --> 01:32:23,541
All right, boys, break it in.

1101
01:32:23,686 --> 01:32:26,451
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
I've got the key.

1102
01:32:30,026 --> 01:32:32,120
Let's go! It's a raid!

1103
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:35,155
Whoa! The cops!

1104
01:33:26,258 --> 01:33:27,816
Mom?

1105
01:33:30,562 --> 01:33:32,588
Back exit!

1106
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:37,969
Debbie!

1107
01:33:39,373 --> 01:33:40,772
Debbie!

1108
01:33:44,646 --> 01:33:46,011
Rick!

1109
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:49,007
Rick!

1110
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:52,447
Diana Ross is playing next week.
I got three tickets.

1111
01:33:52,555 --> 01:33:54,420
How about Boy George? The Police?

1112
01:33:54,657 --> 01:33:55,749
Oh, hi!

1113
01:33:55,892 --> 01:33:57,382
Oh, no! Not her!

1114
01:33:57,528 --> 01:33:59,519
No! No! Anything but that!

1115
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:01,426
No, not her! Not her!

1116
01:34:01,598 --> 01:34:04,090
She pees standing up! Not her!

1117
01:34:09,874 --> 01:34:12,867
Stan! You lying dog!

1118
01:34:15,948 --> 01:34:17,940
Hey, wait a minute. Hold it.

1119
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:21,576
What did you say, Stanley?
What did you say, Stanley?

1120
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:23,616
What did you say, Stanley?

1121
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:26,658
You said no hookers!
You said no hookers!

1122
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,058
No hookers! No hookers!

1123
01:34:31,233 --> 01:34:32,666
Debbie!

1124
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:40,073
Where is Debbie? Where is Debbie?

1125
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:48,817
- What are you doing?!
- Debbie, you'll always be mine!

1126
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,180
Rick!

1127
01:34:50,856 --> 01:34:52,380
Hey, have you seen Debbie?

1128
01:34:52,557 --> 01:34:53,751
Shit! Shit!

1129
01:34:57,797 --> 01:34:59,162
Shit!

1130
01:35:00,633 --> 01:35:03,067
- I thought she was just next to you.
- No.

1131
01:35:06,006 --> 01:35:07,405
Oh, shit!

1132
01:35:12,814 --> 01:35:14,839
Get outta there!

1133
01:35:18,287 --> 01:35:20,915
- Cole!
- You're coming with me!

1134
01:35:22,224 --> 01:35:24,785
God, he's kidnapping her!
Back to the bus!

1135
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:44,449
Help! Rick!

1136
01:36:21,326 --> 01:36:24,125
Debbie! You're coming in with me!

1137
01:36:26,632 --> 01:36:29,032
Cole, I've had enough.
How about you, huh?

1138
01:36:29,168 --> 01:36:31,228
- Come with me!
- Just give it a rest.

1139
01:36:31,338 --> 01:36:32,430
No!

1140
01:36:32,572 --> 01:36:34,005
Tickets. Hey!

1141
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:59,893
Tickets? Tickets?

1142
01:37:08,013 --> 01:37:10,641
There's 36 theaters.
They could be anywhere.

1143
01:37:10,816 --> 01:37:12,511
Oh, great.

1144
01:37:12,885 --> 01:37:16,480
- Now what do we do?
- Let's just split up. We'll go this way.

1145
01:37:16,689 --> 01:37:18,248
Ryko!

1146
01:37:19,426 --> 01:37:23,294
I killed the mule! I killed the...

1147
01:37:29,737 --> 01:37:33,003
What is the sense of living?

1148
01:37:38,748 --> 01:37:41,512
I'll take this theater. Ryko,
take the one down there.

1149
01:37:44,755 --> 01:37:46,780
Ooh. Small theater.

1150
01:37:59,339 --> 01:38:00,863
Rick?

1151
01:38:01,007 --> 01:38:02,565
Rick!

1152
01:38:19,295 --> 01:38:21,160
What a realistic effect!

1153
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:47,085
This is the best 3-D
I've ever seen!

1154
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,285
I've seen better.

1155
01:38:54,735 --> 01:38:55,963
Wow!

1156
01:39:18,263 --> 01:39:23,565
This time I'm gonna do it,
and nobody's gonna stop me.

1157
01:39:38,853 --> 01:39:40,878
Fuck...!

1158
01:40:05,117 --> 01:40:07,779
Do you, Richard Ernesto Gassko,

1159
01:40:08,019 --> 01:40:12,616
take Deborah Julie Thompson
as your lawful wife,

1160
01:40:12,925 --> 01:40:15,485
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

1161
01:40:15,628 --> 01:40:18,427
for better for worse,
for richer for poorer,

1162
01:40:18,599 --> 01:40:23,026
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

1163
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:25,002
I sure do.

1164
01:40:37,019 --> 01:40:41,650
So by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1165
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:43,983
You may kiss the bride.

1166
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:50,399
Uh... I'm sorry. It needs
something special here.

1167
01:40:50,568 --> 01:40:52,594
Hold on. Wait.

1168
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:55,936
Oh, God Almighty!

1169
01:40:58,945 --> 01:41:02,540
How about this? Come on, we're
married now. This is perfectly legal.

1170
01:41:03,183 --> 01:41:04,617
Honey!

1171
01:41:04,785 --> 01:41:08,084
Rick, stop it! Get that
thing away from me!

1172
01:41:11,426 --> 01:41:13,451
Come here, Mrs Gassko.

1173
01:41:16,298 --> 01:41:18,893
Step on it, driver. We don't
wanna miss our plane.

1174
01:41:19,068 --> 01:41:20,330
Right.

1175
01:41:20,436 --> 01:41:22,631
Hey, now, Brad...
