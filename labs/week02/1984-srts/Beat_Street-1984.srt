00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,750
It's coming from in there.

158
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,601
Tito?

159
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,202
- Tito who?
- Tito Reyes.

160
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,372
What the hell are you doing down here?

161
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,482
I'm looking for him, all right?

162
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,452
He's about this high, plays congas.
I was in the army with him.

163
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,456
- You're looking for him in the basement?
- <i>Este esta loco.</i> Let's get out of here.

164
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,822
No, wait.

165
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,057
This is the address, right?

166
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,769
- Sure. Malo's big brother.
- Yeah, but they dipped out a long time ago.

167
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,503
- After the fire.
- What fire? Tito was in a fire?

168
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,045
Tito wasn't in a fire. The building was.

169
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,241
Landlord torched this building
about five times.

170
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,742
Damn.

171
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:06,054
I've thought about him for almost a year.
Man, he could play them conga drums, too.

172
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,025
We were supposed to get up a band.

173
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,858
It's been my dream to play in a band
in New York.

174
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,626
This ain't New York, this is the Bronx.

175
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,664
Come on, K, let's get back to business.

176
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,543
- Could you give me something to eat?
- You got any cash?

177
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,838
Come on.

178
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,618
What's up?

179
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,858
You're biters. All your homeboys are biters.

180
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,424
- You're all wack. What's up with that?
- What are you talking about?

181
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,528
I never stole moves from you.
Your moves ain't worth it to be bit.

182
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,004
What's up with that, punk?

183
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,267
Punk? Who you calling punk?

184
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,545
That's biting.

185
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,715
Later. Roxy?

186
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,221
- Don't flake.
- Be there.

187
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,583
- Damn Spit! Writes his name on everything.
- Ramo, what you doing?

188
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:26,626
Lousy bastard, Spit!
That was Luis' best burner.

189
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,893
It's only been running three days.

190
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,266
- Ramo, later for that.
- Come on.

191
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,964
Get on the train.

192
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,120
Good morning.

193
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,939
Ramo's making us
the baddest sweatshirts. Word.

194
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,011
You know the kind that turn inside out?

195
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,077
One side's gonna say "Beat Street"
and our name.

196
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,623
The other side will have curvy lines.

197
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,216
And when I do my backspin...

198
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,522
it'll be the baddest, man. Incredible.

199
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:11,461
Kenny, why don't you just move that cereal
and lay your whole body across the table?

200
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,366
I thought we'd stopped
dancing on the sidewalk for pennies.

201
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,003
But, Mom. We made $46 last time.

202
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,445
The money is not the issue, Lee.

203
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,179
Sit up, Kenny.
What time did you get in last night?

204
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,809
About midnight.

205
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,956
I'm glad you're still telling me the truth.
Now eat.

206
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,364
What's the big deal about eating oatmeal...

207
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,064
when all I feel is tired for real?

208
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,832
<i>Is my rap too slick, my tongue too quick</i>
<i>my gallant talent like a magic trick?</i>

209
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,373
<i>Eat your eggs before I break your legs.</i>

210
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,639
Now you know where your
gallant talent came from.

211
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,009
Open the door, Lee.

212
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,606
Open the door.

213
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,022
Who goes there?

214
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,717
Chollie, brother.

215
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,355
Who goes there, little brother?

216
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,092
You know I don't want you out so late.

217
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,167
When you do it, Lee does it, too.

218
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,999
Then I've got the both of you
to worry about.

219
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,000
I've already lost one son out there.

220
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,475
There he is, Double K. How you doing?

221
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,879
- How are you, Mrs. Kirkland?
- Good morning, Chollie.

222
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,042
You want this toast, man?

223
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,812
Tomorrow, we're loose.
And I got a rocket in my pocket.

224
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,291
Comps to the Roxy.

225
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,891
I'm talking major leagues.

226
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,433
How did you do that?

227
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,435
Just a little business.

228
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,301
If you're going to be a superstar
you have to check out the style.

229
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,103
I've got my own style.

230
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,805
Yeah, but you just need some
of them professional touches.

231
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,978
Chollie, superstar is not a profession.

232
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,511
You can keep your dreams, gentlemen.
But get something to fall back on.

233
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,385
We got to get going.

234
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,162
Yo, Kenny. Yo, Chollie.

235
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,132
What's happening, Lee?

236
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,568
Yo, Chollie. Watch this.

237
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,975
You better practice up.

238
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,190
When we get to the Roxy tonight,
Beat Street breakers are gonna kick ass.

239
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,456
I don't know, little brother.
The Bronx Rockers are tough.

240
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,628
Yo, Ramon, let's go, my man.

241
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,103
Goddamn.

242
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,370
What are you doing? Stop!

243
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,937
Please, don't do this to me. Stop.

244
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,711
Man, I would not put up with that shit.

245
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,815
What are you, crazy?

246
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,720
- You're beautiful.
- Yeah, I'm beautiful.

247
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,051
Fuck him!

248
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,025
He's just helping you stir the paint, brother.

249
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,155
"When are you going to stop
writing on the walls and make some money?

250
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,961
"When are you going to stop tagging
the subway cars?

251
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,502
"When are you going
to make your son legitimate?"

252
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,060
Legitimate, shit.

253
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,938
Just tell him about all the money
you're going to make with me and Kenny.

254
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,241
You know we're gonna have album covers,
posters, T-shirts, buttons...

255
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,544
- Chollie, you're always talking that shit.
- You're damn right.

256
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,481
Talk about something else.

257
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,715
Yeah, let's talk about
bombing subway cars, Ramon.

258
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,552
That's real fresh, brother, real smart.

259
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,923
Why don't we talk about what
a big goddamn deal you're gonna be?

260
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,020
That's all you ever think about anymore.
King of the Hustlers.

261
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,224
And you think like some little kid.

262
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,097
Man, you're so phony.

263
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,161
What are you doing?

264
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,364
<i>Live from the Bronx, it's the 6:00 news</i>

267

<i>that it ain't even funny</i>

268
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,978
Take it away, Walter.

269
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,778
Let's kick his ass.

270
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,874
You gonna kick what?

271
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,565

Hold it. He with you?

295
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,301
Yeah. He's my bodyguard.

296
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,928
Hi.

297
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,214
What you doing, man?
How come you don't frisk them?

298

Robert!

300
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,916
I'll see you all later.
I got a battle to attend to.

301
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,546
Yo, Double K, chill out.

302
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,228
<i>All right! Get down!</i>

303

00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,001
<i>Emancipation</i>

314
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,900
<i>It's a proclamation</i>

315
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,371
<i>All across the nation</i>

316
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,968
<i>It's a heavy situation</i>

317
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,415
<i>Frantic, frantic, frantic</i>
<i>Now Shango and Soul Sonic</i>

318
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,622
<i>Two groups of heavy knowledge</i>
<i>are trying to educate you</i>

319
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,926
<i>So you won't become a frantic fool</i>

320
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,957
<i>Vibration of the music,</i>
<i>On the dance floor, fantasy illusion</i>

321
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,473
<i>A breakin' beat, electric boogaloo</i>
<i>Street dancing's now a cultural school</i>

322
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,028
<i>Now sing, now sing</i>

323
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,441
Yo, Jazzy! Jazzy J!

324
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,215
What's happening? What's up, man?

325
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,011
What's up, Double K?
What's going on, man? All right.

326
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,487
Come here. Come on up.

327
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,689
Come on up and check this out.

328
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,708
Bronx Rockers.

329
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,875
Gino.

330
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,013
Come on.

331
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,981
There's Beat Street. Let's serve them.

332
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,355
The Bronx Rockers are here, man.

333
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,494
It's Beat Street, man.

334
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,088
They're gonna battle, man.

335
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,701
Do it!

336
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,569
<i>Break dancing's where it's at</i>

337
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,877
<i>Say what?</i>

338
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,852
<i>Hit me</i>

339
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,290
<i>We all take</i>

00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,326
<i>Energy</i>

<i>San Francisco</i>

<i>And Zimbabwe</i>

343
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,421
<i>Break dancing's where it's at</i>

344
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,306
<i>Say, where it's at</i>

345
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,323
<i>Break, break</i>

346
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,611
Come on, Crazy baby.

347
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,619
Crazy, my man! Do it!

348
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,194
<i>Break, break, break, break, break</i>

349
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,433
Let's go, Kuriaki!

350
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,147
Come on, Beat Street!

351
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,350
Little brother was hot.

352
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,848
The Roxy's having auditions
next Tuesday, my man.

353
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,891
- We're gonna get you in here, mark my word.
- Baby, let's dance.

354
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,993
All right, let's dance.

355
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,367
Hi, I'm Tracy Carlson from City College.
What's your name?

356
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,996
Hello, my name's Lee.

357
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,064
- You're a wonderful breaker.
- Thank you.

358
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,737
I like you a lot.
Can you give me your phone number?

359
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,298
Damn!

360
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,878
- Why'd Spit do it, man?
- 'Cause he can't do no better.

361
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,039
Like, he used to do these tags
that were just stupid.

362
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,846
They were so lame, everybody thought
they were already messed up.

363
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,945
So now, he's gonna go over
everybody else's stuff.

364
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,650
Man, somebody needs to break his hands.

365
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,159
Does anybody know who this guy is?

366
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,984
Nobody knows.

367
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,832
Check it out.

368
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,593
It's so white.

369
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,728
It's so clean!

370
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,100
Ramo, we gotta.

371
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,141
All you ever talk about is white trains.

372
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,848
We gotta go.

373
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,134
If I get in that show of theirs,
ain't gonna be nothing like it.

374
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,043
Just let us do all the talking about business.

375
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,343
But I don't need help.
I can do my own talking.

376
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,680
We're all going in with you, Lee.

377
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,083
She didn't invite nobody but me.

378
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,457
Little brother, this is the big time.

379
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,489
If you want to be part of their show,
your manager has to protect your interests.

380
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,001
What if they want to take you on the road?

381
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,903
How about some extra money
if they put you on TV?

382
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,803
You think about that?

383
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,449
Check that out.

384
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,606
Hold it.

385
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,239
Tracy, hold it.

386
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,912
Tracy, the tempo on this section
is a little slow...

387
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,356
Yo, Tracy!

388
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,220
Lee! Come on up.

389
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,058
Bring your friends!

390
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,265
That's the guy that I met. The dancer.
He's a fabulous dancer.

391
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:16,296
Thank you so much. Thank you, too, Tracy.
It's a wonderful idea.

392
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,901
We're going to have a discussion now,
but you're all welcome to stay.

393
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,413
And Tracy knows where to reach you
with tickets for our performance.

394
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,676
I want to check something out.

395
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,878
My brother ain't here
to be in your show, is he?

396
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,313
I'm afraid this performance
is limited to our students.

397
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,689
- How come no one told him that?
- I thought they had.

398
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,626
I made it perfectly clear to Lee.

399
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,061
That's cool. Ain't no big deal.

400
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,329
I've never been on TV before,
so if you just flip on that tape...

401
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,735
I don't think so. Maybe tomorrow,
if you come back, we can...

402
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,569
- But I don't understand.
- We're too busy now.

403
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,235
Wait a minute. He can't see the tape?

404
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,939
After you all check him out
like he's some freak?

405
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,846
- Wait a minute...
- You wait a minute, mister.

406
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,079
Lady, you're showing people
how you down with breakin'...

407
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,589
and that's bullshit,
because you ain't down with nothing.

408
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,556
And you looked so proud.

409
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,992
"I found that little nigger myself.
Do I get an A, teacher?"

410
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,895
You're like all the biters.
You just take a bite and leave the rest.

411
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,464
- Our tape!
- Let him have it.

412
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,004
Linda.

413
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,678
Little runt.

414
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,910
Carmen!

415
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,782
Ramon!

416
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,788
Where have you been all week?

417
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,702
I missed you.

418
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,737
I had some stuff to take care of.

419
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,306
Yeah, I know.

420
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,273
I've been wanting to talk to you.

421
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,606
- Where's Julian?
- He's in the kitchen.

422
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,745
- I brought a gift for him.
- You did?

423
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,320
Hello, Mrs. Cavarro.

424
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,916
Here's your daddy.

425
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,484
That's a joke.

426
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,556
How can you even look him in the face?

427
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,726
Ramon.

428
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,970
It's so beautiful.

429
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:04,465
A little T-shirt doesn't make up for anything.

430
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,144
When will you take
some responsibility, Ramon?

431
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,612
- I'll put it on him right now.
- Is everybody deaf?

432
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,309
- Mommy, please don't start.
- I have to know why...

433
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,898
I'm sorry.

434
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,309
You can see how bad it is here.

435
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,546
Take us somewhere.

436
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,746
I got no place to take you.

437
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,712
Please, Ramon.

438
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,552
We'll be together.

439
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,258
- Where?
- Anywhere.

440
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,307
<i>Two more.</i>

441
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,433
<i>Now single count.</i>

442
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,504
<i>Reach left and right,</i>
<i>and left, and right. Come on.</i>

443
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,844
<i>Hold on now. Just four more.</i>

444
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,134
- Yes?
- Is this Lee Kirkland's house?

445
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,840
I'm Lee's mother. What you want him for?

446
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,883
I'd like to talk to him.

447
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,281
Maybe you want to talk to his brother.

448
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,353
I'd like to talk to him, too.

449
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,325
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

450
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,825
This young lady's looking for Lee.

451
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,356
For what?

452
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,806
Could you turn that down a little?

453
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,541
Lee's out right now.

454
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,806
If you want,
I can tell him what you came for.

455
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,311
Exactly what did I come for?

456
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,551
To get your tape back.

457
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,453
Who do you think you are?

458
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,585
You wreck my class with bullshit about me...

459
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,129
taking a bite out of your brother
and leaving the rest.

460
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,564
Let me tell you something.
I'm not a taker, and I'm not a user.

461
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,262
I told Lee exactly what was involved.

462
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,065
He's out right now.
I don't know what to tell you.

463
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,301
You just tell him I came by.

464
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,243
I know where Lee's at.

465
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,440
Where?

466
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,644
It's kind of dangerous.
I mean, you might not be up to it.

467
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,419
- Let me be the judge of that.
- Yes, ma'am.

468
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,326
Can I ask what you were doing?

469
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,432
Mixing, just trying some new stuff.

470
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,734
Like what?

471
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,871
It's kind of hard to explain.
Do you want to hear something?

472
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,034
Yeah.

473
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,462
See, I tape anything I think sounds good.

474
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,990
You know, add it with a lot of other stuff.
Water coming off a pipe...

475
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:08,038
making that tick-tock sound.
Add a little reverb.

476
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,470
Or this<i>...</i>

477
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,337
That's my piece.

478
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,841
- You mean you wrote that?
- Why, is that strange?

479
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:20,975
No.

480
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,620
That is some heavy shit.

481
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,849
You know, it's not so different
from what you're doing here.

482
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,516
How do you mean?

483
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:32,219
When I wrote this,
I tried to combine different styles...

484
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,830
- but it's really hard.
- Tell me about it.

485
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:39,164
I can't get the sounds in my head on tape.
I haven't got the right equipment.

486
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,864
You should come to school.
We have great equipment.

487
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,705
- I'd introduce you to the studio guy.
- You'd really do that?

488
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,065
Yeah.

489
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,306
You still feel like being dangerous?

490
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,479
Come on.

491
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,451
You sure now?

492
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,683
Let's go.

493
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,785
Where are we going?

494
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,866
Down there? I'm not going down there.
You're crazy.

495
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,370
It's not too far. This time of night,
locals run every 16 minutes.

496
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,566
- There's lights all the way.
- I'm not going down there.

497
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,974
I'm not gonna let you get hurt.

498
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,476
I promise.

499
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,882
There's no electricity this side of the tracks.
Stay right with me.

500
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,791
When the spur comes in up ahead,
just watch where I'm walking.

501
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,060
Right over here.

502
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,445
Train!

503
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,626
A white one.

504
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,663
Train's coming.

505
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,437
Come on.

506
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,731
- Yo, Ramo.
- Yo, check this out.

507
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,827
All right. Get back up, guys.
I saw a cop on that last train.

508
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,065
Hurry!

509
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,937
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi. How you doing?

510
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,501
I dig it. This is really fresh, Ramo.

511
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,978
Where'd you learn to do this?

512
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,481
- English class.
- No, I'm serious.

513
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:40,573
No kidding.

514
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,882
I used to trace these old DC comics,
'cause it was so boring.

515
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,720
That's where I figured out
all the streaks and blurs and shit.

516
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:51,989
Not too high on that cloud, all right?
You're gonna go over that Phase 2.

517
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,053
Come on, I ain't stupid.

518
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,825
What's Phase 2?

519
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:01,030
Phase 2 is the guy who practically
invented the idea of burners.

520
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,136
Before that,
everything was just these little tags.

521
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,936
A tag is your name.

522
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,775
And this<i>...</i>

523
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,705
That's a burner.

524
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,655
Pack it up!

525
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,291
Want to get something to eat?

526
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:05,266
No. We got some plans.

527
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,914
How about you?

528
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:00,979
Do you have brothers and sisters,
besides Lee?

529
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,991
I had an older brother.

530
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,816
What happened?

531
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,522
He was in this big gang in the Bronx.
He was into some bad shit.

532
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,534
When the cops came down on them...

533
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,762
a lot of guys got wasted,
and Franklin was one of them.

534
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:22,737
I was 12 years old, and I was mad.
I wanted to go to war.

535
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,315
But my friends told me that that was stupid.

536
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,818
Anyway, gangs died out back then.

537
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,857
Are you cold?

538
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,451
No.

539
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:44,199
Do you have a boyfriend?

540
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,634
Not really.

541
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,459
What are you doing here?
You have a home?

542
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,499
Damn, you smell good. I'd say you got up.

543
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:01,762
Be cool, Kenny. Let me hear the details.

544
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:03,802
Kenny, was she good?

545
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,397
- What?
- Man!

546
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,576
Little brother might have to learn
that information someday.

547
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,671
Turn me loose right now,
or you'd better never let go.

548
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,515
See that, Lee? Man gets a little nooky,
he cops an attitude.

549
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,383
He already has an attitude.

550
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:21,145
Damn it! You're gonna give me rabies.

551
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:24,682
You keep your voice down.
What are you doing here, man?

552
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,287
Opportunity is beating on our door, man.

553
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,992
DJ at the Burning Spear
got his fingers smashed by his little brother.

554
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,036
Slammed 'em in a window.

555
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,936
We'll be in Kool Herc's office
before Kool Herc.

556
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:40,373
- Kenny, tell me how she feels.
- Shut your dumb mouth.

557
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:45,905
Sounds to me like Double K is in love.

558
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,042
Better get some sleep, brother.
We got work to do.

559
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,229
It's a shame about
Super Ease's hands and all...

560
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,296
but you're gonna love Double K.

561
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,901
He is the baddest,
the freshest young DJ in the Bronx.

562
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,467
He better be.

563
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:18,540
<i>Funk</i>

564
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,226
<i>Ain't it funky now?</i>

565
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:08,962
- You think you got it together?
- Yeah, man, it's chill.

566
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,830
<i>All right, you people get ready to cheer</i>

567
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,233
<i>For the Christmas show</i>
<i>at the Burning Spear</i>

568
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:18,672
<i>All you hip-hops are in for a treat</i>
<i>'cause Santa Claus is on Beat Street</i>

569
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,849
<i>Open up your door</i>

570
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:34,720
<i>I'm Santa Claus, and guess what, y'all?</i>
<i>I got something to show</i>

571
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:39,284
<i>I came to bring some Christmas spirit</i>
<i>I got a big bag, now guess what's in it</i>

572
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,796
<i>Something for the rich</i>
<i>and something for the poor</i>

573
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:43,957
<i>So Merry Christmas and ho, ho, ho!</i>

574
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,297
<i>"Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas", my foot</i>

575
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,600
<i>I'm gonna tell you what Santa really put</i>
<i>Under my so-called tree</i>

576
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,732
<i>But in reality looked like nothing</i>
<i>but a decorated pole to me</i>

577
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:55,106
<i>Man, you talk about a tree,</i>
<i>it makes me wonder</i>

578
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,668
<i>'Cause I never had a tree</i>
<i>to put anything under</i>

579
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:01,843
<i>If I ever did luck up and get a tree</i>
<i>There was never anything under it for me</i>

580
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,148
<i>Man, y'all should be glad that I didn't quit</i>

581
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,780
<i>'Cause I'm gettin' too old</i>
<i>for this Santa Claus shit</i>

582
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,188
<i>Y'all think I'm gettin' presents</i>
<i>made for free?</i>

583
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:11,192
<i>I got to pay them elves, nobody payin' me</i>

584
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,560
<i>You big fat whale, you might as well quit</i>
<i>'cause I can name 100 presents I didn't get</i>

585
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:18,031
<i>And if I did get a present</i>
<i>it'd be a hand-me-down</i>

586
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,432
<i>I got this for Christmas</i>
<i>Now how'd that sound?</i>

587
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:22,596
<i>It sounds good to me</i>
<i>'cause I'm about to freeze</i>

588
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,936
<i>Want to see something?</i>
<i>Look at the bottom of these</i>

589
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:27,134
<i>Me and my brothers can't go out</i>
<i>at the same time</i>

590
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:29,302
<i>A coat that's theirs</i>
<i>is a coat that's mine</i>

591
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:33,712
<i>I know one thing, y'all better get off my neck</i>
<i>And wait till you get your welfare check</i>

592
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,274
<i>Go on down to the office</i>
<i>and stand on the line</i>

593
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,320
<i>Better hurry up, see, I got mine</i>

594
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:40,912
<i>Jingle jangle</i>

595
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,719
<i>Jingle for the poor</i>

596
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:45,325
<i>And once you get your welfare check</i>

597
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:47,692
<i>Y'all can kiss my mistletoe</i>

598
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:59,065
<i>That's why the presents</i>
<i>keep getting mixed up</i>

599
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,336
<i>'Cause year after year, you keep fucking up</i>

600
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,674
<i>And now I know why,</i>
<i>'cause you're always drunk</i>

601
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:08,183
<i>- Instead of G.I. Joe, you send me this junk</i>
<i>- That ain't a G.I. Joe, that's a G.I. Jerk</i>

602
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:12,584
<i>With a kung fu grip that don't even work</i>
<i>So all I did was just put him away</i>

603
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,714
<i>'cause my G.I. Joe looked G.I. Gay</i>

604
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,486
<i>That's why you don't get presents</i>
<i>'cause you're ingrates</i>

605
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,892
<i>If G.I. Joe's gay</i>
<i>what difference does it make?</i>

606
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:22,226
<i>He's just a doll,</i>
<i>ain't too much he can do</i>

607
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,323
<i>If you ask me, boy,</i>
<i>I ain't too sure about you</i>

608
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,336
<i>Listen, bloat-o, with your big fat suit</i>
<i>Next time say no, don't send no substitute</i>

609
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,134
<i>Because I asked you for a beat box</i>
<i>and you know what I got?</i>

610
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:34,176
<i>Douggie Fresh</i>
<i>You know, that kid from down the block?</i>

611
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,055
<i>For a facsimile, we must admit</i>

612
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,423
<i>Douggie Fresh is good</i>
<i>and made a perfect fit</i>

613
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,054
<i>He's the only reason</i>
<i>why we weren't totally mad</i>

614
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,588
<i>Without Douggie,</i>
<i>our Christmas would have been really sad</i>

615
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,603
<i>Go sing</i> Silent Night <i>and</i> Jingle Bells
<i>And all those Christmas rhymes</i>

616
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:07,233
<i>'Cause nobody gives a shit</i>
<i>About a reindeer and hard times</i>

617
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:11,643
<i>You just jingle and jangle</i>
<i>And hang out with the poor</i>

618
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:16,347
<i>And when you get your welfare check</i>
<i>You can buy reindeer by the score</i>

619

<i>Well, let's get Douggie Fresh</i>
<i>And Magnificent Force</i>

620
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:20,915
<i>And head on out the door</i>

621
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,484
<i>And leave these party people singing</i>
<i>Jingle jangle for the poor</i>

622
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:29,930
<i>Sing jingle jangle</i>
<i>Jingle jangle with the poor</i>

623
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:34,262
<i>Jingle jangle, jingle with the poor</i>

624
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,139
<i>Jingle jangle</i>

625
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,569
<i>Jingle jangle with the poor</i>

626
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,217
What are you doing next weekend?

627
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,344
- I'm free.
- No, you're not.

628
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:01,862
Let's dance.

629
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,361
Tell your mother
Pedro wants me to work late tonight.

630
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,926
Carmen needs to stay with us.

631
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:23,703
- We have no bed for her. You know that.
- She can stay with me.

632
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,202
You are not married to her.

633
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,210
If I marry her, she can stay with me?

634
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:34,977
She can stay in the place
that you make for her...

635
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,677
if you was a man.

636
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,117
I am a man.

637
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:40,815
A man?

638
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:44,184
A man takes care of his own.

639
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,620
A man has a job.

640
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:51,930
He's not a criminal who goes around
scrawling on the subways.

641
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,764
How come a man's what you say?

642
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,469
I'm a graffiti writer.

643
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:01,407
I'm an artist. I don't just throw up little tags
all over the place.

644
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,672
I make them trains beautiful.

645
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,150
How come you won't even
come see what I do?

646
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:38,307

652
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:03,234
<i>You could live out your fantasies in your life</i>

653
01:04:03,305 --> 01:04:05,899
Make sure I speak to her manager.

654
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,474
<i>It is possible</i>

659

660
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:36,162
<i>Just move your feet</i>

661
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:39,100
<i>While the music's hot it just won't stop</i>

662
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:41,438
<i>Everybody dance to the radio rock</i>

663
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,978
<i>Music's hot, it just won't stop</i>

664
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,243
<i>Everybody's dancing,</i>

665
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,284
<i>Baptize the beat, baptize the beat</i>

666
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:50,443
Next.

667
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,212
Damn.

668
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:58,183
<i>That's right, that's deep</i>
<i>Everybody jumps to the vicious beat</i>

669
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,196
<i>Vicious beat, beat, vicious beat, beat</i>

670
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:10,398
<i>I'm Brenda Starr, and I rap to the beat</i>
<i>I go to the Roxy just to move my feet</i>

671
01:05:10,472 --> 01:05:12,702
<i>You see, I break and boogie,</i>
<i>I rap to the beat</i>

672
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,243

<i>I'm here to tell you, to tell you the scoop</i>

677
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,922
<i>I play no games, I'm right to the point</i>

678
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,423
Make sure her manager
gets in touch with me.

679
01:05:35,297 --> 01:05:38,391
- Hold up a minute, K.
- What are you talking about?

680
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:42,597
I want you to wait outside for me, all right?
I know what I'm doing.

681
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,434
What are you doing?

682
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,732
I am just about to take
the biggest chance of your life.

683
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,243
Great. Next.

Thank you. That's it.

705
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,911
You've got some pretty good talent
for your show.

706
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,546
You think they're talented?

707
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:46,287
- No, most of them are pretty lame, right?
- Who the hell are you calling lame?

708
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:48,454
You calling Tina B lame?

709
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:49,588
No.

710
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:55,168
My point is, I got a man
that's got something special.

711
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,829
Auditions are over.

712
01:07:56,905 --> 01:08:00,204
He's Kool Herc's main man
down at the Burning Spear.

713
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,501
Kool Herc?

714
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,441
Okay, bring him in. I'll give him a listen.

715
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,984
- You want to see him?
- I just said I did, Jim.

716
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,987
Then be at the Burning Spear,
Saturday night.

717
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,586
Yo, Kenny!

718
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,394
- Let's go.
- What happened?

719
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,294
It's in the pocket, brother.

720
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:50,884
Okay.

721
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,465
What do you think?

722
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:10,539
- The place don't look so bad after all.
- Looking good.

723
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,413
Landlord's gonna raise your rent.

724
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,574
You can really fix up
one of these old places.

01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,744
Yeah.

726
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,787
Yo, Double K, what's happening?

727
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,292
How's it going, Kenny?

728
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,453
Trace cut you loose tonight or what?

729
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:30,760
She's rehearsing her show.
Girl's too busy for me.

730
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,491
You really think Monte will show up
Saturday night?

731
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:36,036
I told you, it's in the pocket.

732
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,900
I really charmed that sucker.

733
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,701
You know, I was thinking...

734
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,777
that empty apartment upstairs...

735
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,544
maybe I'll start hanging out around here.
Fix it up for me and Carmen and the baby.

736
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,553
Really, Ramo? That'd be great.
We could be neighbors.

737
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,055
What're you gonna do about money, man?

738
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:57,921
- Get a job.
- Say what? You?

739
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,728
Yeah. What the hell.

740
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,885
Give me some tape.

741
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,757
Watch it.

742
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,746
Surprise! Merry Christmas.

God.

745
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,169
Let's throw on some music here.
Get this party going.

746
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,941
You know what I mean?

747
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,945
See? We put the crib right by the heat.
Keep him nice and warm.

748
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,643
Water's running.

749
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:06,782
Yeah, and the bed works, too.
We checked it out personally.

750
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,052
Oh, God.

751
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,951
I just don't know
how I'm gonna thank you all.

752
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,894
- How you feeling?
- Great, man.

753
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,436
Thanks a lot, you guys are the greatest.

754
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:25,763
Us Puerto Ricans
got to stick together, right?

755
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,373
He's crazy.

756
01:13:31,172 --> 01:13:33,037
Yo, Kenny, it's Monte.

757
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:34,840
He's coming?

758
01:14:19,754 --> 01:14:23,622
- You listen pretty good.
- Herc, I'm not stealing your headliner.

759
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:27,355
Just giving him a little downtown exposure.
You got everything to gain.

760
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:32,332
- I'm looking out for the boy's interest.
- I can look out for Double K's interests.

761
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,628
Do me a favor.

762
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,227
New Year's Eve,
do exactly what you did tonight.

763
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:39,637
Don't worry about it.
Double K won't change a note.

764
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,740
So when do we see the contract?

765
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,471
He your manager?

766
01:14:45,513 --> 01:14:48,038
Yeah, well, don't let that stop you.

767
01:14:56,524 --> 01:14:59,152
Yo, chill out, man. I hear something.

01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:28,819
<i>The battle cry</i>

775
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:31,419
No way.

776
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,619
<i>You see</i>

777
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,060
<i>Is it time for what's in store</i>

778
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,524
<i>The crews are headed for a dancing war</i>

779
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:43,662
<i>Who rocks, who rocks,</i>
<i>who rocks, who rocks?</i>

780
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:48,906
<i>Battle cry</i>

781
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,177
<i>Street drums</i>

782
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,138
<i>Speed drums</i>

783
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,508
<i>Street drums</i>

784
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,013
<i>Speed drums</i>

785
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,748
<i>Street drums</i>

786
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,948
<i>Who rocks, who rocks,</i>
<i>who rocks, who rocks?</i>

787
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:08,084
<i>Battle cry</i>

788
01:16:17,605 --> 01:16:20,938
It's the police!
Come on, man. Let's get out of here!

789
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:31,977
Get off me, man!

790
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:35,287
Stay still.

791
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,326
Amazing, isn't it?

792
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,029
Then do the same thing to add other sounds
to other keyboard registers.

793
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,230
Look.

794
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,937
Add a little scratch.

795
01:16:58,746 --> 01:17:01,306
And the computer prints out the score.

796
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:03,247
Isn't that incredible?

797
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,980
Yeah. That's good, man.

798
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,353
Here, play with it a while.

799
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,857
In a couple of hours, he'll probably
have it doing tricks nobody else thought of.

800
01:17:21,636 --> 01:17:25,538
Kenny, while you're working,
I have some work to complete with Tracy.

801
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,868
- It's the piano part.
- The intro.

802
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:28,931
Yes.

803
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:36,981
- I can't believe the performance is tomorrow.
- You'd better believe it.

804
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,451
Need some help?

805
01:18:23,464 --> 01:18:25,364
The keyboard went dead.

806
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:28,801
You wiped out the disk.

807
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:31,401
Here, I'll reprogram it for you.

808
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:33,531
- I got to get going.
- Going?

809
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:35,908
I thought you wanted to use the studio...

810
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:39,674
to try out some sounds
for your New Year's Eve show at the Roxy.

811
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,883
I don't need new sounds, man.
What I got's plenty.

812
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,215
It was plenty good enough
to get me the gig.

813
01:18:45,286 --> 01:18:47,982
Excuse me, Robert.
Kenny, what's the matter?

814
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,751
Nothing's the matter.

815
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:52,657
I'm fine, you're fine.
We should just leave it that way.

816
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:54,752
What do you mean by that?

817
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:57,489
I've got things to do, my own things.

818
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,898
You got your own things to do
with your own friends.

819
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,163
Robert?

820
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,636
You think that was so new and great,
what he was doing? That was nothing.

821
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,439
- We were just trying to help you.
- I don't need help.

822
01:19:10,511 --> 01:19:13,537
- Other people respect what I do.
- And I don't?

823
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:17,310
You don't even know why I'm with you.

824
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,977
I got it figured out.

825
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:21,954
You are the missionary, and I'm the native.

826
01:19:30,798 --> 01:19:32,459
Man, look at these toy cops.

827
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:35,525
They don't know the difference
between dancing and fighting.

828
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:37,366
Word. It's true, man.

829
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:40,771
If we were fighting,
these people would've run the other way.

830
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,504
If you know what's good for you,
you'll shut up!

831
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:47,706
Mom!

832
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,754
Mom, these fools busted us for dancing.
Could you believe this?

833
01:19:53,821 --> 01:19:58,190
I believe you better shut your mouth
before I decide to leave you here.

834
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:00,088
Take my advice.

835
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:03,524
You better nip that little attitude in the bud.

836
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:06,389
That's heading for nowhere but trouble.

837
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:09,868
You're kind of young
to be giving advice, aren't you?

838
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,730
If my son says he was dancing,
that's what he was doing.

839
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:18,108
If you're gonna arrest people for dancing,
maybe you're the one who needs advice...

840
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:21,444
'cause there are lots of worse things
these kids could be doing.

841
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,279
- That I know.
- Word.

842
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:39,161
I don't know. Maybe I made a bad mistake.

843
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:43,704
I mean, she's got this big performance
of her composition tonight...

844
01:20:44,138 --> 01:20:46,368
so she's thinking about that.

845
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:50,309
Man, women are always trying
to change you.

846
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:53,077
Is Carmen trying to change you?

847
01:20:53,214 --> 01:20:55,375
Hell, no. Who told you that?

848
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,845
You got that dumb job.
That's a big change, isn't it?

849
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:02,253
That was just something I had to do.

850
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:07,158
It'll be better once I start working day shifts.
Night shifts interfere with my real work.

851
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:09,321
Is that all you want to do?

852
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:12,696
Go bombing trains at night
and pushing a broom all day?

853
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:15,065
Why are you getting on my case?

854
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,797
I'm not getting on you, man.

855
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,410
You see them?

856
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:28,309
Their tags are little black letters
on little white cards of paper.

857
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:30,645
My tag's running...

858
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:33,744
in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, right now.

859
01:21:34,188 --> 01:21:36,554
In every borough, on every line.

860
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:39,789
It's eight feet high, and it's beautiful.

861
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:43,590
- But what about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow's a long way off, man.

862
01:21:43,731 --> 01:21:45,756
When I'm writing trains...

863
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:50,299
or when you're mixing sounds,
making people dance, that's everything.

864
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:51,770
We're alive.

865
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,267
The white one.

866
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:02,205
- Somebody made it an A train.
- So, what does that mean?

867
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:06,049
That means tonight, after work, it's mine.

868
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:03,876
There it is.

869
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:22,194
Take this off, will you?

870
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,497
- Do that fill-in in red, okay?
- Okay.

871
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:07,760
Come on.

872
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:10,162
Let's go do the other side.

873
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,365
You've got to be kidding. Ramo!

874
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,825
Do you hear something?

875
01:26:53,974 --> 01:26:55,066
Spit!

876
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,441
Kenny.

877
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:53,078
Sorry I missed your concert.

878
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:57,121
That wasn't important.

879
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,523
I know what you mean.

880
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:03,789
That New Year's Eve gig at the Roxy...

881
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,465
I don't think that's so important.

882
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,092
But you're gonna do it, aren't you?

883
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,670
I don't know.

884
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:16,070
I have an idea for something I could do.

885
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,605
- But I'm not sure how.
- Can I help?

886
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:24,511
Please?

887
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:40,595
Grand Master Melle and the Furious Five...

888
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:44,365
Twenty-five breakers,
the City College dancers...

889
01:30:44,471 --> 01:30:46,530
and a Bronx gospel choir?

890
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:51,375
Do you realize
what you're asking these people to do?

891
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:53,709
- They'll do it.
- They'll do it.

892
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,939
Yeah, so they'll do it...

893
01:30:56,483 --> 01:31:00,715
but there's no way in hell anybody's
gonna let you turn New Year's Eve at Roxy...

894
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,915
into some kind of a funeral.

895
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:06,785
It won't be a funeral. It'll be a celebration.

896
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:09,261
Kenny, are you crazy?

897
01:31:11,665 --> 01:31:14,293
This is the opportunity of your life.

898
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:17,370
It's my life.

899
01:31:22,576 --> 01:31:24,066
Okay, brother.

900
01:31:25,145 --> 01:31:27,045
Then let's do it right.

901
01:31:48,235 --> 01:31:49,827
<i>Beat Street, breakdown</i>

902
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,180
<i>Beat Street, the king of the beat</i>

903
01:32:10,257 --> 01:32:13,021
<i>You see 'em rockin' that beat</i>
<i>from across the street</i>

904
01:32:13,093 --> 01:32:17,154
<i>Beat street is a lesson, too</i>
<i>Because you can't let the streets beat you</i>

905
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:23,826
<i>Well, a picture can express</i>
<i>a thousand words</i>

906
01:32:23,904 --> 01:32:26,168
<i>To describe all the beauty of life you give</i>

907
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,836
<i>And if the world was yours to do over</i>
<i>I know you'd paint a better place to live</i>

908
01:32:30,944 --> 01:32:33,276
<i>Where the colors would swirl</i>
<i>and the boys and girls</i>

909
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:35,542
<i>Can grow in peace and harmony</i>

910
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:40,383
<i>And where murals stand on walls so grand</i>
<i>As far as the eyes are able to see</i>

911
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:44,584
<i>I never knew art till I saw your face</i>
<i>And there'll never be one to take your place</i>

912
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:47,058
<i>'Cause every time</i>
<i>you touch a spray-paint can</i>

913
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:49,527
<i>Michelangelo's soul controls your hands</i>

914
01:32:49,596 --> 01:32:51,496
<i>Then serenades of blue and red</i>

915
01:32:51,565 --> 01:32:53,965
<i>And the beauty of the rainbow</i>
<i>fills your head</i>

916
01:32:54,034 --> 01:32:58,596
<i>Crescendo colors play in tune</i>
<i>Man, why did you have to die so soon?</i>

917
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:03,109
<i>Sayin' one, two, three, four</i>
<i>Just let me know what you came here for</i>

918
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:07,511
<i>And just clap your hands, everybody</i>
<i>And let me know that I'm not alone</i>

919
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:12,280
<i>And if you knew my man when he was alive</i>
<i>Scream it out and say, "Ramon!"</i>

920
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,048
<i>Ramon!</i>

921
01:33:16,356 --> 01:33:19,325
<i>I'm talking 'bout</i>
<i>ashes to ashes and dust to dust</i>

922
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:23,830
<i>Where the good die young as all they must</i>
<i>'Cause as life must live, death must die</i>

923
01:33:23,897 --> 01:33:26,195
<i>And the tears shall fall from the living eye</i>

924
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:28,393
<i>Tell me, who's gonna dream</i>
<i>the impossible dream</i>

925
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,937
<i>Of the beautiful cities</i>
<i>and the island streams</i>

926
01:33:31,004 --> 01:33:35,703
<i>When your works of art brought into being</i>
<i>All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing</i>

927
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,767
<i>Still-life, urban masterpiece</i>

928
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:40,245
<i>Your trademark was written</i>
<i>on trains and walls</i>

929
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:44,842
<i>A million-dollar gift only God would leave</i>
<i>And yet you got killed for nothing at all</i>

930
01:33:44,918 --> 01:33:49,355
<i>So after this, there'll be no more hard times</i>
<i>No more bad times, and no more pain</i>

931
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:53,860
<i>No more chump change, none of that bull</i>
<i>Just movies, museums, and the hall of fame</i>

932
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:58,694
<i>So all you hip-hops, get on up</i>
<i>And let's take it to the top where we belong</i>

933
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:01,029
<i>'Cause the age</i>
<i>of the Beat Street wave is here</i>

934
01:34:01,101 --> 01:34:04,559
<i>Everybody, let's sing along,</i>
<i>now come on, say, "Ho!"</i>

935
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:06,837
<i>Say, "Ho!"</i>

936
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:19,144
<i>And to let me know</i>
<i>I'm rockin' the microphone</i>

937
01:34:19,219 --> 01:34:21,483
<i>Everybody say, "Ramon!"</i>

938
01:34:22,856 --> 01:34:24,050
<i>Ramon!</i>

939
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:28,453
<i>A newspaper burns in the sand</i>

940
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:30,861
<i>And the headlines say, "Man destroys man"</i>

941
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,922
<i>Extra, extra, read all the bad news</i>

942
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,798
<i>On the war of peace</i>
<i>that everybody would lose</i>

943
01:34:35,869 --> 01:34:40,101
<i>The rise and fall, the last great empire</i>
<i>The sound of the whole world caught on fire</i>

944
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,472
<i>The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble</i>

945
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,841
<i>The game that left the whole world</i>
<i>in shambles</i>

946
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:49,144
<i>The cheats, the lies, the alibis</i>
<i>And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies</i>

947
01:34:49,516 --> 01:34:53,748
<i>Lost in space, and what is it worth?</i>
<i>The President just forgot about Earth</i>

948
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,288
<i>Spendin' multi-billions</i>
<i>and maybe even trillions</i>

949
01:34:56,356 --> 01:34:58,517
<i>The cost of weapons ran in the zillions</i>

950
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:00,890
<i>There's gold in the street</i>
<i>Diamonds under feet</i>

951
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:03,225
<i>And there's children in Africa don't even eat</i>

952
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:07,825
<i>Flies on their faces, they're living like mice</i>
<i>The houses even make the ghetto look nice</i>

953
01:35:07,901 --> 01:35:10,062
<i>The water tastes funny,</i>
<i>it's forever too sunny</i>

954
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:12,571
<i>And they work all month</i>
<i>and don't make no money</i>

955
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,735
<i>A fight for power, a nuclear shower</i>
<i>People shout out in the darkest hour</i>

956
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:21,506
<i>At sights unseen and voices unheard</i>
<i>And finally the bomb gets the last word</i>

957
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:24,016
<i>Christians killed Muslims,</i>
<i>and Germans killed Jews</i>

958
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:26,314
<i>And everybody's bodies</i>
<i>are used and abused</i>

959
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:30,846
<i>Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted</i>
<i>Superiority complex is deep-rooted</i>

960
01:35:30,924 --> 01:35:35,361
<i>Leeches and lices, and people got prices</i>
<i>Egomaniacs control the self-righteous</i>

961
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:40,059
<i>Nothing is sacred, and nothing is pure</i>
<i>So the revelation of death is our cure</i>

962
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:44,570
<i>Dachau, Auschwitz, Hiroshima</i>
<i>Vietnam, Leningrad, Iwo Jima</i>

963
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:46,936
<i>Okinawa, Korea, the Philippines</i>

964
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:49,134
<i>Devastation, death,</i>
<i>catch the killing machine</i>

965
01:35:49,209 --> 01:35:51,700
<i>The people's in terror,</i>
<i>the leaders made an error</i>

966
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:53,905
<i>And now they can't even look in the mirror</i>

967
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:56,142
<i>'Cause we got to suffer</i>
<i>while things get rougher</i>

968
01:35:56,216 --> 01:35:58,377
<i>And that's why we got to get tougher</i>

969
01:35:58,452 --> 01:36:00,613
<i>So learn from the past</i>
<i>and work for the future</i>

970
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:02,882
<i>And don't be a slave to no computer</i>

971
01:36:02,956 --> 01:36:05,322
<i>'Cause the children of man inherit the land</i>

972
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:07,383
<i>And the future of the world is in your hands</i>

973
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:11,921
<i>So just throw your hands in the air</i>
<i>And wave them like you just don't care</i>

974
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:14,229
<i>And if you believe that you're the future</i>

975
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,462
<i>Scream it out and say, "Yeah!"</i>

976
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:19,068
<i>Yeah!</i>

977
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:27,004
<i>Everybody, do you believe?</i>

978
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,377
Yeah!

979
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:30,006
<i>Do you believe?</i>

980
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:36,052
<i>Let me hear you say, "Yeah!"</i>

981
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:49,634
<i>Believe it</i>

982
01:36:50,671 --> 01:36:52,764
<i>Believe it</i>

983
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:18,657
<i>They buried us</i>

984
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:21,963
<i>So we became a flower, believe it</i>

985
01:37:22,669 --> 01:37:24,034
<i>Believe it</i>

986
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,563
<i>They gave us nothing</i>

987
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,541
<i>So we took power, believe it</i>

988
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:31,776
<i>Believe it</i>

989
01:37:39,786 --> 01:37:44,917
<i>They tried to break us</i>
<i>And now we're the breakers, believe it</i>

990
01:37:45,959 --> 01:37:47,324
<i>Believe it</i>

991
01:37:47,427 --> 01:37:49,827
<i>We come from the ashes</i>

992
01:37:49,896 --> 01:37:52,160
<i>The movers and shakers</i>

993
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,032
<i>Believe it</i>

994
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,644
<i>Now we're going on</i>

995
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:07,236
<i>We're the hip-hop</i>

996
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:09,145
<i>Now we're going on</i>

997
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,150
<i>We're gonna take you to the top</i>

998
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,243
<i>Now we're going on</i>

999
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,412
<i>We can't stop, believe it</i>

1000
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,894
<i>Strut, strut</i>

1001
01:38:34,274 --> 01:38:36,105
<i>Break it down, break it down</i>

1002
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:45,276
<i>We are the harvest of a bitter seed</i>

1003
01:38:46,052 --> 01:38:47,610
<i>Some of us fall</i>

1004
01:38:48,021 --> 01:38:49,750
<i>Some of us bleed</i>

1005
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,619
<i>But we are the future</i>

1006
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:53,720
<i>And we will succeed</i>

1007
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,220
<i>Believe it</i>

1008
01:38:55,595 --> 01:38:56,960
<i>Believe it</i>

1009
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:59,497
<i>We are the miracle</i>

1010
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,363
<i>We are the strong</i>

1011
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:04,802
<i>We are the right that came from wrong</i>

1012
01:39:04,871 --> 01:39:08,272
<i>We made hope into our song</i>

1013
01:39:08,508 --> 01:39:10,032
<i>Believe it</i>

1014
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,600
<i>Believe it</i>

1015
01:39:27,727 --> 01:39:31,458
<i>I'm a Christian, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Jew</i>

1016
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:33,655
<i>Believe it</i>

1017
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:39,028
<i>I believe in me, I believe in you</i>

1018
