1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
She likes you.

2
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,560
You see, Melanie...

3
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,200
she's every bit as pretty.

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,120
You've been very nice.

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,840
Now you can have what you want.

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,440
Hey, you!

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,200
Birdboy!

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,000
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers
can give you asthma.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
I've got a great idea.

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,600
Let's enlist.

11
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Kids got to play, honey.

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,360
Go tell that to your son.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Birdy!

14
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Are you all right?

15
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
Switch shifts on Th8ursday?

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,520
How come they didn't
change the bandages?

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,080
No, ma'am.
He's 8unavailable right now.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Can I have him call you?

19
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
That's Doctor Moore.

20
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
How long do I wear these things?

21
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,240
We'll take them off when you
get back from seeing your friend.

22
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Then I'll see if you got
everything back in the right place.

23
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Should be okay,
give or take an ear or two.

24
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,960
I think the graft is
going to be just fine, Al.

25
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
After a while it'll start itching,
but you can't scratch it.

26
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
This ought to hold you.

27
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,440
How do you feel?

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,880
Like the invisible Man.

29
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,160
Come see me when you get back, okay?

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
Sure thing.

31
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
Don't worry.

32
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Don't stare, honey.
It's rude.

33
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Shit, Birdy.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
The things you put me through.

35
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,240
They always said you were weird.
Even my kid brother.

36
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Do you remember the time
with the knife?

37
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Jesus Christ!
These damn kids!

38
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,800
Way to go! Now we'll never
get it back. The lady's a witch.

39
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Stay out of my yard!

40
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,240
You hear?

41
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,320
We don't have another ball.
How else we going to play?

42
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,920
By not hitting it here.
Go somewhere else and play.

43
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,080
This ain't no ballpark.
This is my yard.

44
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Why don't you do something about it?

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
Kids got to play, honey.

46
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,120
You tell that to your own boy.

47
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,280
I don't want to.

48
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,040
Come on, why not?

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
I just don't feel like it.

50
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
Sure you feel like it.

51
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Well, if I let you...

52
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,600
can I wear your letter jacket?

53
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes.

54
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,400
Hey, Al.

55
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,760
- Al!
- What?

56
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
He's down the street.
The weird kid.

57
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
Later, Mario. Get lost.

58
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Come on, you promised.

59
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey, birdboy!

60
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,760
What's your name?

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
This is like talking to the air.

62
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Got a knife I can borrow, kid?
Got a splinter.

63
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,160
This it, Mario?

64
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,880
Yeah, that's my knife.

65
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,000
You thief!
My brother says it's his.

66
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
Back off!
Don't mess with me!

67
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,880
Don't mess with my brother!

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,640
He's a wrestling champion!

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,640
Now you're in trouble!
This really better be your knife.

70
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,800
It is.
Ziegenfuss stole it from me.

71
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,760
I thought you said he stole it!

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
No! I just said he had it.

73
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Jesus, Mario.

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,960
I bought it from Ziegenfuss.
But if he stole it, you can have it.

75
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't touch it.

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,400
- It's mine.
- We'll get you another.

77
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Here.

78
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Thanks.

79
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Where'd you learn all that stuff?
You wrestle or something?

80
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,160
No.

81
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,040
You should.

82
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,320
You like pigeons?

83
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
What's to like?

84
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
They fly.

85
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,040
They fly. So what?

86
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,640
That's enough.

87
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Come on, Al. Are we going, or what?

88
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,680
I'm training these
to be carrier pigeons.

89
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,400
You mean with the notes,
like in a war?

90
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
I got a class. I've got to go.

91
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,520
So go.

92
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,920
Up yours!

93
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,280
Pretty ugly birds.

94
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,200
You know, if he really can train
them to carry notes, I'd buy one.

95
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
- You would?
- Sure. A lot of kids would.

96
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
Wait a minute!

97
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,760
How about if I help you catch some?

98
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,280
It's funny how they do that.

99
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,640
If it hadn't happened every
five minutes for the last 50 years....

100
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
Dumb.

101
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,440
They always come back
to the same place.

102
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,160
See?

103
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Same exact spot every time, and just
carry on with their business.

104
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,760
- Come on.
- Where you going?

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Higher.

106
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,840
- We got to get up to talk to them.
- Are you kidding?

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,640
Are we allowed up here?

108
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,360
Looks awful high to me.

109
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Fuck you!

110
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
It worked!

111
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,000
Birdy, where are you?

112
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
Very funny.
Now where the fuck are you?

113
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,440
Come the hell out.
I know you're in here, birdbrain.

114
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
What's that?

115
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,840
A pigeon suit I'm making for you.

116
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,520
This way, they'll think
you're one of them.

117
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,600
I don't want them to think
I'm one of them.

118
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,880
Come on, just try it.

119
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
No way would I be caught dead in that.

120
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,560
I feel ridiculous.

121
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,200
You look terrific.

122
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,240
Come on.

123
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
It's over here.

124
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,440
I want to go change.
I look stupid!

125
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,320
Not to a bird, Al.

126
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,280
That's some view.

127
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,600
Can you see the Tower Theatre?

128
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,200
That must be City Hall over there.

129
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Stars, Al.

130
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,560
Look at the stars.

131
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
What stars?

132
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,200
We should come back
to just look at them.

133
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
What are you doing?
For chrissakes, get down!

134
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,280
Hold my legs, will you, Al?

135
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,360
You'll like this one, Al.

136
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
She looks like your dad.

137
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
I got to get a little lower.

138
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Let me down a bit more.

139
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,200
Jesus, Birdy!

140
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Give me a bag.

141
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Fuck!

142
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,560
No! Birdy!

143
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,200
Hold on, I'll get help.

144
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
I can't hold on that long.

145
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
What's so funny?

146
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,160
You.

147
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
You look so serious.

148
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,120
It is fucking serious!

149
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Shit!

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Look, this isn't going to work.

151
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,440
I'll try to make it to the sand pile.

152
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,600
- What are you talking about?
- It's easy.

153
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
You'll jump?

154
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,760
No, Al, I'm going to fly.

155
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
Don't jump!

156
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
Let go!

157
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Birdy, are you all right?

158
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,440
Birdy, are you all right?

159
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I flew, Al.

160
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,320
Sure, you flew.

161
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
It was beautiful.

162
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,800
It was like....

163
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,760
You look awful pale, Birdy.

164
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,360
Should I go get somebody?

165
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,960
You might have busted something inside.

166
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
You'll break your crazy neck
one of these days.

167
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,520
God, Birdy!
Don't do anything like that again.

168
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,280
What do you think, sergeant?

169
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,520
Sir?

170
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,960
Your friend.

171
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,040
How does he look to you?

172
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,280
It's hard to say.
I'm not sure I understand your question.

173
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
It's a simple question.

174
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,840
How does your friend look?

175
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,280
Are you his doctor?

176
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,480
Why are you asking me?

177
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,160
Obviously, because I want to hear
what you have to say.

178
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
He doesn't look good.
Does he just sit there like that?

179
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
For the most part.

180
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,800
Was he wounded?

181
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,640
Yes, but his wounds
were relatively minor.

182
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,960
This is not a physiological condition.

183
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,800
Then how'd he get like this?

184
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,320
All we know is that he was
missing in action for a month.

185
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,760
For a while, we didn't even
know who he was.

186
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,240
Does he know who he is?

187
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,680
I don't know.

188
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
He hasn't talked since he was found.

189
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,920
So you really don't know anything.

190
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
I think I know a few things, sergeant.

191
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,440
It was my idea to bring you here.

192
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,840
Why am I here?

193
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,240
The patient's mother
thought you might be...

194
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
well, of some help.

195
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,080
Frankly, I'm willing to try anything.

196
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,880
- And I'm it?
- For now.

197
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,040
When I found out about
your condition....

198
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,360
It seems like it might be
an interesting therapy.

199
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,120
For him or for me?

200
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,040
I hope for both of you.

201
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,960
Come with me.
There's something I want you to see.

202
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,000
No, tuna salad, not chicken salad.

203
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
Lots of mayonnaise and none of those
little celery chunks.

204
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,960
Two of them.

205
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,360
Do you want anything?

206
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Coffee?

207
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Two coffees, cream and sugar.

208
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
Okay, yeah, that's it.

209
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
Strange, huh?

210
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,640
Jumping and twisting,
like he was trying to escape.

211
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,640
You sure can't blame him for that.

212
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
No one is, sergeant.

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,040
He wouldn't like being cooped up here.

214
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,400
What do you suppose impels him
into these strange positions?

215
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
Like what?

216
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,040
Like this...

217
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,040
cringing position.

218
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,760
Was there any psychological trouble
before he was in the military?

219
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,200
How close were you?

220
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,120
We was real good buddies.
Pretty close.

221
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,120
Very close?

222
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
We weren't queer for one another
or anything like that.

223
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,760
We were normal, crazy Philly kids.

224
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,800
How crazy?

225
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,600
You ever been to Philly, sir?

226
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,320
You have to be pretty crazy
to live there.

227
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,720
I don't understand yet
what's brought him to this.

228
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,080
You got any ideas?

229
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,600
He got drafted.

230
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,920
All wars have
their casualties, sergeant...

231
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,920
and the Army takes care
of their own.

232
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,960
Certainly took care of me, doctor.

233
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,080
Major, sergeant.

234
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,960
Major, sir.

235
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
I know that this is difficult
for you at this time.

236
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,680
And I know it's hard for you
to come here like this.

237
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
How does your face feel?

238
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
It's okay.

239
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,000
No problems?

240
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,040
The bandages are a little hard
to get used to, sir.

241
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,600
When the doctor...
The major...

242
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,520
said one of the things they
had to do was give me a steel jaw...

243
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,160
l thought, "Great!
A steel jaw!

244
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Maybe I'll be the next La Motta."

245
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,160
Turns out, a punch could knock
the pins into my brain...

246
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,120
so it's worse than a glass jaw.

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,960
It's pretty funny, huh?

248
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
A lot of people wouldn't think so.
Aren't you concerned?

249
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Sure, kind of.

250
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,480
You know what would be
a good idea, Alfonso?

251
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,280
- Al.
- It might be helpful...

252
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,520
if you visited your friend now.

253
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,080
It's important that
I make some progress soon.

254
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,160
Ronsky? Send Renaldi in here.

255
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,600
You'll like Renaldi, Alfonso.
He's Italian too.

256
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,320
What's going on here?

257
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,320
Occupational therapy.
Some genius at Boeing thought it up.

258
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Who better to sort out
the nuts than nuts, right?

259
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
- What do you do here?
- Pretty much everything.

260
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,800
Mostly I help take care
of the patients.

261
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,360
I take them for walks,
read them the funnies...

262
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,680
blow their noses,
change the bedpans...

263
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,280
wheel them into the TV room.
Stuff like that.

264
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,040
How'd you get that shitty job?
They bust you?

265
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm a conscientious objector.

266
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,440
You're kidding.

267
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
An Italian conscientious objector?

268
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,560
That's right.

269
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,200
Hi, Ned. Nice day.

270
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
Ned's elevator doesn't go
up to the top floor.

271
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,880
Combat stress. He's quiet today.

272
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,800
Normally, he's throwing shit
against the walls.

273
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
Here he is.

274
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,640
I'll be back soon, and
I'll take you to your bunk.

275
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,480
They have you in with me.

276
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,640
Take it easy.

277
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,440
Hey, Birdy.

278
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,160
Is this for real, or what?

279
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,280
If this is some act you cooked up to
get out of Nam, it worked.

280
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,200
You can stop now.

281
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,560
Come on, Birdy.

282
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,480
It's me under all these bandages.

283
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
It's Al.

284
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,320
Maybe I'll get into
something crazy myself.

285
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,720
Can't you see it?

286
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,160
" Neighborhood Boy Turned a Lunatic
by the Horrors of War."

287
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
All I'd have to do
for a pension is growl...

288
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,920
or go beat somebody up
on Market Street.

289
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,800
So much for that.

290
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,600
God, this place gives me the creeps.

291
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,400
It's awful quiet for a loony bin.

292
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,280
You know, they keep saying
I'll be fine.

293
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,880
I keep hearing them.

294
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,040
"Quit worrying how you look,
Columbato."

295
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,280
But I saw a guy at Dix
who they also said would be fine.

296
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,040
And he had a face like
a medium-rare cheeseburger.

297
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm scared I won't recognize
who I'm shaving in the morning.

298
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,600
Jesus, Birdy, what happened to you?

299
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,360
That fat-gut shrink,
he wants me to jog up your brain...

300
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,760
by getting you to remember
the things we did together.

301
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,840
Did we jack one another off?
Stuff like that.

302
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
I don't trust that guy.

303
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,240
Everything's too interesting to him.

304
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,960
So what do you want to talk about?

305
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,440
Maybe we should talk about
one of the 85 million times...

306
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,200
we tried to find where your mother
hid the goddamn baseballs.

307
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay, you don't like that one.

308
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,120
Remember that statue of Billy Penn
on top of City Hall?

309
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,880
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

310
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,360
And how we used to stand there
with the pigeons?

311
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,760
Every time some old lady would walk by,
we'd point at Billy Penn.

312
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,280
They'd look up, and they'd see
Billy with his dong sticking up.

313
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Shit!

314
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,840
Do you need a hand?

315
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
What are you doing here?

316
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm his friend.
The doctor brought me.

317
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Right!

318
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
Now I remember.

319
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,040
- What's your name?
- Columbato, Al.

320
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
You know, I'm not in the Army.

321
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,200
You can tell me your name
frontways if you want to.

322
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,520
I'm Hannah.

323
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,440
He eats that?

324
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,520
Looks horrible, doesn't it?
It's all he'll let me feed him.

325
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,360
You have to feed him?

326
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,240
Can't he feed himself?

327
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't know.

328
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
He doesn't.

329
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
He won't let the orderlies feed him.

330
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
For some reason, he lets me.

331
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,920
Shit, maybe I'll stop talking.

332
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,520
I like your friend.

333
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,080
But I wish he wouldn't do this.

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,560
Listen, I'm going to go.

335
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,440
You can stay if you want.

336
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
That's all right.
I'll go bunk out for a while.

337
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,600
Okay, hang on. I'll unlock you.

338
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,320
Hi there.
Let me take a look at your back.

339
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,960
Tell me where it hurts.

340
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,160
My buddy's broken his leg.

341
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
Maybe his back.

342
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,680
I hope not his back,
because that can make you crazy.

343
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
He's a little crazy.
He thinks he can fly.

344
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,240
He thinks he's a bird.

345
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,240
It's all here, the whole thing,
how he fell off the gas tank.

346
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,880
There's a picture showing where he
jumped and an "X" where he landed!

347
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,880
I don't want to hear any more!
Not birds, not nothing!

348
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,720
You can start now...

349
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,600
by cleaning the pigeon shit
off the front porch.

350
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,160
Face it, we're out of
the pigeon business.

351
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,320
- They ain't coming back.
- They'll come back, they were homed.

352
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,240
What kind of home is it when
your witch of a mom chops it up...

353
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,320
and chases the birds away?

354
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,640
It's home to them.

355
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,200
It's not the lumber and nails.
It's the place.

356
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,360
I got to tell you something.

357
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,800
But you have to promise
not to go ape-shit on me.

358
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,840
What?

359
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
Do you promise?

360
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,400
You're right.
Those birds kept coming back.

361
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,000
Your mom puts down poison
and knocks off half of them.

362
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,240
But those blue bars get smart
and still keep coming back.

363
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,240
So she calls Mr. Solari.

364
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,320
Mr. Solari, the poultry guy?

365
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,600
Yeah, the butcher.

366
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,120
That guy would dress his mother
as a chicken...

367
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,040
if he got 69 cents a pound.

368
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
He must've taken them.
They ain't been back since.

369
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,680
No, you don't get it, Al.

370
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,320
Those blue bars saw Solari.

371
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,400
That's why they didn't come back.

372
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,320
You're wrong!
Solari bagged them.

373
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
They're dead!
Plucked and fucked!

374
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
You don't understand birds, Al.

375
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,360
I got an idea for something else
we can go partners on.

376
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,760
You know that old Ford
at the junkyard?

377
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
Yeah, okay.

378
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,520
It's a good thing those blue bars
recognized Solari, huh?

379
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
Pigeons ain't stupid, Al!

380
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,160
Remember that statue
of Billy Penn on top of City Hall?

381
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,800
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

382
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,040
If I'm going to learn,
I'll have to watch them closer.

383
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Be there when they fly.

384
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,480
I want them to be
as free as possible.

385
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,480
Nobody wants to be in a cage.

386
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,800
How are you doing back there?

387
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,440
- You okay?
- Yeah, just great.

388
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,200
That is some piece of shit.

389
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,880
Does it go?

390
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Not yet.

391
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,080
But it will.

392
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,760
- How'd it get here?
- We pushed it.

393
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,400
- It's a piece of shit.
- Thank you.

394
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,120
Don't use any of my tools.

395
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,920
No, sir.

396
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,920
You'll have to register that
before you sell it.

397
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,680
How, Mr. Columbato?

398
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,600
You wait till you're old enough.

399
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,840
- Maybe I'll do it for you.
- That'd be great, Dad.

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,560
Fucking garbageman!

401
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,720
Come on, sister!

402
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
All right.

403
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, now!

404
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Top down!

405
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
There she goes!

406
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,400
We're doing 80 on the expressway.

407
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,280
Look for 76 and the Walt Whitman.
Watch out for cops.

408
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
We need quarters for the toll.

409
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,840
No, I'll drive straight through.

410
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,000
It's not my fault you left
the gate down!

411
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Yeah, you too, motherfucker!

412
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,480
Watch out!

413
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,600
That was a close one.

414
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,120
Tailspin.

415
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,680
We're just driving.

416
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
Where we going?

417
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,120
Where else? The ocean.

418
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,040
I've never been there.

419
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,280
You're kidding.

420
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,720
This is great!
It's like flying in thick air!

421
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,440
Are we going to go see the boardwalk
and pick up some chicks?

422
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,360
Okay, just one more time,
all right? You ready?

423
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,560
On your mark.

424
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,920
Goddamn it!

425
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,400
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

426
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,800
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi...

427
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
five Mississippi....

428
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,400
Ten Mississippi, Birdy!

429
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,760
Thirteen Mississippi.

430
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
It's a 15 Mississippi, Birdy!

431
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,880
Sixteen Mississippi!

432
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,760
I don't know how to swim!

433
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,080
Now don't go do
anything stupid, Birdy.

434
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,240
I know what's in that
goddamned fool mind of yours.

435
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Right down here, on this
same street, they got this ride....

436
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,200
Expectant mothers, the young...

437
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,800
go see the greatest attraction
in the world today.

438
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,280
See Apasha, the Gorilla Girl.

439
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,080
See her change from a woman
to an ape. A gorilla!

440
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,680
It's gross!

441
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,920
- Horrible!
- Was he born like this?

442
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
No way, it's a gyp.
His legs are stuck.

443
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,560
- It's a false bottom.
- Isn't it amazing?

444
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,680
Introducing Zimmy, the human fish.

445
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,120
Folks, let's hear it for Zimmy.

446
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,800
- How does he do it?
- Does what?

447
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,440
Hold his breath so long.
I have to keep coming up for air.

448
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
We've been here four minutes.
He hasn't come up for air.

449
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,320
Think he has a wife?

450
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,520
You okay?

451
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,520
I can hold my breath
for two minutes, 40 seconds now.

452
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
Do you want to try?

453
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,800
You play sports?

454
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,160
Of course not.

455
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
AI and I throw the discus sometimes.

456
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,640
So you play on a team?

457
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,920
We just throw it
to see how far it'll go.

458
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,240
AI used to be on a team.

459
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,480
He used to be a wrestling champ.

460
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,640
Are you guys finished yet?

461
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm leaving!

462
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,120
I ain't hanging around with
that creep no more!

463
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,040
Why do you always do this?

464
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,160
You stuck me with...

465
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,560
Shut up!

466
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,760
What are you going to do now?

467
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,160
Fuck it!

468
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,440
What?

469
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,440
You have got to learn...

470
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,880
to be more sociable!

471
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,040
I don't think she liked me.

472
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,920
You got to make them like you.

473
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,600
Talk like you're interested
in all that crap they go on about.

474
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,360
You just got to talk more.

475
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't care about what,
as long as it's not flying and birds!

476
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,400
What if that's what
I'm really thinking about?

477
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,560
That's the first thing you got to
understand in your dealings with women.

478
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,680
Never let them know
what you're thinking.

479
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm not thinking about them.

480
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,240
Then just lie, for God sakes!

481
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,240
You're the best
goddamn liar I ever met.

482
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,360
Don't you know your chick
had great jugs on her?

483
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,040
I don't understand.
What's the big deal?

484
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,360
- They're just overgrown mammary glands.
- Mammary glands?

485
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,240
Mammary glands?

486
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,160
We're talking tits here!

487
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Big tits!

488
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,040
Round tits.

489
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,120
Fleshy tits.

490
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,880
- Just a lot of dumb development to me.
- Full tits.

491
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,960
Women carry them around
their whole lives.

492
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,080
- Flopping around, getting in the way.
- They don't get in the way.

493
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,160
They're needed.
They're necessary.

494
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,240
I seen a picture in
National Geographic.

495
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,440
Just like on a cow,
but in a more stupid place.

496
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,120
It's not like a cow at all.

497
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm telling you for your own good.

498
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,880
You don't know what you're missing.

499
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
That girl, Shirley...

500
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,520
l didn't even have to ask her.

501
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,800
She just lifted her shirt
and put my hand under it.

502
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,240
And then she undoes her bra for me.

503
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,240
I start feeling the whole tit,
nipple and all.

504
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,920
She's poking her tongue down my throat.

505
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,880
And then, I'm reaching down
with my hand.

506
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,680
I'm working my way down.
She's work...

507
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,640
- That your '53 Ford back there?
- Sure, why?

508
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,840
Could you stop walking around?
You make me nervous.

509
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,320
I cannot stand this much longer.

510
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,080
I hope your old man comes soon.

511
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, I don't.

512
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,520
Hi, Dad.

513
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,440
Hi, Mom.

514
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,280
Ever wonder what our lives down here
must seem like to a bird?

515
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,080
You two shut up!

516
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,080
Fucking fuck!
I'm always fucked!

517
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,840
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

518
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,440
Hi, Al. How are you?

519
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm pretty good, Birdy, thanks.

520
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,040
You know, Al...

521
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,720
I'm glad you came to see me.

522
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,640
We haven't seen each other
in a while...

523
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,160
and there's a lot of water
under the bridge.

524
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,400
But it's good just to sit here
and not talk with you.

525
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,880
Yeah, it's a real blast.
But, you know....

526
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,080
Come on, Birdy!

527
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,480
Talk to me.

528
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,960
Okay, don't talk to me.

529
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,040
You think I don't know
what you're doing...

530
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,280
with this squatting
and sideways staring stuff?

531
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,200
So you're finally a bird.
Big deal!

532
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,800
If Weiss finds out, he'll put
you in a display case...

533
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,800
and write papers on you forever.

534
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,440
Damn cats are driving me crazy!

535
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,800
I'll get a BB gun and pop them off.

536
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,720
They'll give the birds a heart attack,
scaring them all day.

537
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
Let's get this door closed
so they don't get out here.

538
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,520
That's it.

539
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,400
You know my mother.

540
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,440
And that's Mr. Tate.

541
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,520
He's deaf.
He doesn't hear anything.

542
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,840
He loves the birds singing,
like Beethoven.

543
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,280
I said you're like Beethoven.

544
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,080
You like that one, huh?

545
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,320
She's a good-looker, all right.

546
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,640
But don't go for flyers when
you're looking for a good breeder.

547
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,080
Come on, honey.

548
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,000
Come here.

549
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,240
Don't you want to eat?

550
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,760
She's a pretty one,
but won't notice any of the daddies.

551
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,120
She's a heartbreaker.
So particular!

552
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,640
Rhett and Ashley can't get near her.

553
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,920
It sure ain't like in the movie.

554
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,080
I don't let them mate
more than one at a time.

555
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,800
No brothers and sisters.

556
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,320
It ain't right.
Says so in the Bible.

557
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,440
Mr. Tate...

558
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
lets them all in together,
like a Roman orgy.

559
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,600
Ain't natural.

560
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,920
Here's Melanie.

561
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,840
Come here, Melanie.

562
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,400
The first day I saw Perta...

563
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
l knew she was special.

564
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,240
The way she took to the air...

565
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,160
 Iike it was hers.

566
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,040
She likes you.

567
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,320
Don't get taken in
'cause she's a flyer.

568
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,360
Melanie here, she's a darling bird.
Every bit as pretty.

569
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,440
No, I'll take this one.

570
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,400
You can't do anything about it.

571
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,680
He sold it before he ever
told me about it.

572
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,120
At least we got
what we paid for the car.

573
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,360
I'll give you my share.
We can use it for your ornithopter.

574
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,000
I don't care about the money.

575
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,400
It's the principle of the thing.

576
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,640
The only principle is my old man
does whatever he wants.

577
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,600
Do you want me to pin him?
I wish I could, but I can't!

578
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
We're going to get it back.

579
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,800
Are you crazy? Suicidal?
He doesn't even like you.

580
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,200
He'll break your neck.

581
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,320
I don't care.

582
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,520
It's our car.

583
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,760
You can't do this.
You know what he's like.

584
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,200
I tell you, he'll kill you!

585
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,640
Jesus, sometimes you're
so full of shit!

586
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,840
All right, but you're on your own.

587
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,520
I'm not going with you.

588
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,360
I don't want blood
splattered all over me.

589
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,960
Shit!

590
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,920
- I want the car back.
- What do you mean?

591
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,840
- You got your money!
- You had no right to sell it!

592
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,600
It's worth more than the money!

593
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,760
It belongs to us.
We didn't want to...!

594
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,080
That car was in my name.
I'll sell it to whoever.

595
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Would you get out of here?
I'm trying to read my paper.

596
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,440
Tell me the man's name
who thinks he bought it...!

597
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,320
Get out of here. I'll call the cops!

598
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,120
I was about to do that myself!
I'd like to report a stolen car!

599
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,960
Are you calling me
a crook in my own house?!

600
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,680
Are you crazy?!

601
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,240
Are you trying to say
I stole that junk heap?!

602
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,920
Don't embarrass me
in front of my family!

603
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,160
You sold something that wasn't yours!

604
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,760
Give me the man's name
who thinks he bought it!

605
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
I'll tell him you made a mistake!

606
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,200
I sold the car to a friend
of my brother-in-law!

607
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,040
This guy is not
giving you the car back!

608
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,760
You mess around with him and you'll
wind up in a concrete shirt...

609
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,280
at the bottom of the river!

610
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,280
I don't want to go to the police...

611
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,240
but I got a receipt of purchase
from Mr. Russo...

612
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,440
at the junkyard!

613
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,280
You think it's yours
because you registered it for us.

614
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,760
It's legally ours because
you don't got no proof-of-purchase!

615
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,000
Why do you want to be a hard-nose for?

616
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,000
I can't get you the car back...

617
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,840
even if I wanted to!
- So tell me his name!

618
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,960
Shut up, you skinny bucket of piss!

619
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,360
You're not worth going
to jail for, for murder.

620
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,440
Here's what I'll do.

621
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,440
- Here's the money.
- I don't want it.

622
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,640
- That's all I got...
- It wasn't yours to sell!

623
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,000
Shut the fuck up!

624
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,080
He's going to take it.

625
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,400
Read your paper, honey. Please.
He'll take the money.

626
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,920
You'll take the money.

627
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,520
I'll get you more from
my brother if you want.

628
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,120
Don't make no trouble.
Please!

629
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,400
Here.
I don't want it.

630
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,800
Half of it's yours.
You deserve it.

631
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,440
It was our car, Al.

632
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,640
I could never stand up
to my old man like that.

633
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,400
Maybe life is shitty.

634
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,880
It is shitty.

635
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,400
I'll tell you something.

636
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,240
I'm not trying to pin life anymore.

637
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,040
I don't even fucking understand it.

638
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,320
I just want to make it through with
some dignity, like everybody else.

639
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,320
Of course, if there was any real
dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.

640
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
I'm going to go now, all right?

641
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,160
All right?

642
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,600
But I'll be back.

643
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,920
Renaldi!

644
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,760
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!

645
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,720
You okay, Al?

646
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,200
You were moaning as if in pain.
Is your face bothering you?

647
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,840
- You won't tell anyone about this?
- No, of course not.

648
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,600
No, sir, not yet.

649
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,600
Yeah, he's here right now.

650
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,440
His file came in this morning.

651
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,160
Would you come over here, please?

652
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,920
Is your serial number
10107003 or 10107008?

653
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,080
It's 003. Why?

654
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,440
I want to get it right.

655
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,080
It's C-O-L-U-M-B-A-T-O,
Sergeant Alfonso?

656
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,080
What is this?
Am I being taken prisoner?

657
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,760
The major wants some more
information on you.

658
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,800
What do you got, my file?

659
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,440
Everything about you.

660
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,720
There we go.

661
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,280
Is there any history of insanity
in your family?

662
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,800
No.

663
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Why are you asking me?

664
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,600
Suicides?

665
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,640
What?

666
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,800
Any suicides?

667
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,360
Not yet.

668
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,080
Finish that later.
Bring me what you've got.

669
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,600
Come on in.

670
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,280
Excuse me, Major.

671
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,440
Is something wrong
with your secretary?

672
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,800
Oh, you mean the spitting.

673
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,160
Ever since combat,
he's had a bad taste in his mouth.

674
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,680
Don't worry. We're working on him.
Have a seat.

675
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,240
Why was he asking me
all those questions?

676
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,840
I'm not a patient here.

677
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,280
I like to know who I'm dealing with.

678
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,240
How do you think
the Army's treated you?

679
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,440
Not bad. Okay, I guess.

680
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,800
It says you attacked
a superior officer...

681
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,800
just after you arrived in Saigon.

682
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,000
We were in a bar.

683
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,080
I just hit him.

684
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,320
You knocked out four teeth
and broke his nose.

685
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,480
I hit him hard.
He was dogging me.

686
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,360
- You think you might have overreacted?
- Maybe.

687
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,720
Sir, we all make mistakes.

688
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,640
But it's important to learn
from our mistakes. Don't you think?

689
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,880
Shouldn't we be talking
about the patient here?

690
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,760
Whose idea was it to steal that car?
Yours or his?

691
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,240
Steal a car?

692
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,480
I believe it was in Atlantic City.

693
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Oh, that!

694
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,680
That was a misunderstanding.

695
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,120
My father had it registered
in his name.

696
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,520
We were having a good time, you know.

697
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,440
Is that how your father saw it?

698
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,440
No, not exactly.

699
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,040
What did he do?

700
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,440
He took away my allowance.

701
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,800
Listen, you wise guy.

702
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,720
I've got better things to do
than play games with you!

703
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,640
I should probably
send you back.

704
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,280
You don't have to do that, sir.

705
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,360
Maybe you haven't noticed...

706
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,040
what happens to men like your friend,
without special attention.

707
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,760
What do you mean?

708
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,760
They stay here for
the rest of their lives.

709
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,920
They rot.
Sometimes they just die.

710
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,320
I'm sure I can get through to him.
I just need some more time.

711
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,440
All right, sergeant.

712
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,640
This is not an
indefinite stay for you.

713
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,160
You can go.

714
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,880
One more thing.

715
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,920
Did you or your friend
resent your father...

716
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,320
for that misunderstanding
about the car?

717
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,200
No, sir.

718
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,680
We both really liked my father.

719
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,680
He was a heck of a guy.

720
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,920
Not so bad, right?

721
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,480
Oh, shit! I should be done
with him by now.

722
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,840
Would you feed him
while I go finish up?

723
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,040
- Sure.
- Thanks.

724
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,240
Take this.

725
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,840
I'll be right back.

726
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,840
I saw that cockeyed look of yours.

727
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,080
That look always means something.

728
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,560
You think I was hitting on her,
don't you?

729
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,640
You think maybe she likes me?

730
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,360
You really got to quit it
with this crap.

731
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,720
I got to get out of here.

732
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,080
That shrink gives me the eye
like I'm crazy.

733
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,520
It's not a great feeling.

734
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,960
Not that it ever
seemed to bother you.

735
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,800
Come on, Birdy, eat it.

736
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,160
If you could see yourself
squatting here...

737
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,800
and me shovelling
this crap down your throat...

738
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080
you'd probably laugh
yourself to death.

739
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,320
What?

740
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,200
I won't have another
talking-to-the-wall conversation.

741
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,160
Decide if you're listening or not.

742
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,480
We'll do it your way.

743
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,120
We'll sit here and commune
like goddamn birds.

744
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,120
Hey, pretty.

745
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,640
Come here.

746
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,120
How do you do that?

747
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,360
Your mother said enough for tonight.
It's almost 3 o'clock.

748
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,200
I'm working on my ornithop...

749
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,840
Come on, enough's enough!
We're supposed to be asleep!

750
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,920
Tell him.
You're his father.

751
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,320
Come on, son.

752
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,160
Leave the bird alone.

753
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,680
Then the bird's feather.

754
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,520
It has a hollow shaft, with
feeders for blood circulation.

755
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,360
On either side are branches, barbs...

756
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,600
which branch into barbules...

757
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,640
which have little barbicels
with hooks on the end of them.

758
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,800
It can all be pulled apart,
like a zipper.

759
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,000
And then re-zipped.

760
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,400
A bird runs its beak
through its feather...

761
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,920
re-zipping feathers
that have come apart.

762
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,440
Flying is much more than flapping wings.

763
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,000
A bird can flap its wings
and not move an inch.

764
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,600
When it wants to fly...

765
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,840
the slightest flicker
sends it up to the sky.

766
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,240
You must feel that air has substance
and can hold you up.

767
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,560
It's mostly a matter of confidence.

768
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,880
Fuck them.
What do they know, anyway?

769
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,120
Did you notice Doris Robinson
giving you the eye?

770
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,800
She must be hot for
mad-scientist types.

771
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,320
- You ought to ask her out.
- I don't think so.

772
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,320
I can't afford to take her out.

773
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,280
It doesn't cost anything.

774
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,920
You think Cheryl's charging me for it?

775
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,360
I'll go to the cafeteria.
You want to come?

776
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,200
I want to go down and talk to my dad.

777
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,760
Dad?

778
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,720
Dad!

779
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm in here.

780
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,760
Come on in.

781
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,240
You had lunch yet?

782
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,520
- I'm not hungry.
- You got to eat.

783
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,760
Grab a sandwich and sit down.

784
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,520
Dad...

785
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,280
l want to ask you a question.

786
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,040
Shoot.

787
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,880
I want another canary,
a male for mating.

788
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,720
Maybe you can talk to Mom.

789
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,320
I don't know.
We don't want to antagonize her.

790
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,040
I had a heck of a time getting her
to let you build the aviary.

791
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,800
She's worried...

792
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,960
about what it's costing
for the feed...

793
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,560
the lumber and whatnot.

794
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,360
The birdseed's cheap.

795
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,600
- AI and I swipe the lumber.
- I sure won't tell her that.

796
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,000
She's convinced
your friend is AI Capone.

797
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,200
I know.

798
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,440
Don't think your mom
doesn't want what's best.

799
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,200
She's concerned that you develop
interests and friends...

800
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,400
that'll help you fit in.

801
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,040
Fit into what?

802
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,200
Whatever. You know, life.

803
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,960
She thinks I won't fit
in with AI and a canary?

804
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,080
It's not that.
It's just, well....

805
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,520
Take me.

806
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,280
I've always had an interest in wicker.

807
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,880
When I met your mom,
I could make a better wicker chair...

808
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,120
than any man in Philadelphia.

809
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,800
I still could, if anybody wanted one.

810
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,560
But nobody cares about wicker anymore.

811
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,120
So I don't fit into
the scheme of things.

812
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,800
You see what I'm saying?

813
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,800
Your mother just wants you
to wind up better than me.

814
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,280
Every parent wants that.

815
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,440
I'm just saying you should be
interested in something practical too.

816
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,440
It's hard to be good
at something nobody wants, huh?

817
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,680
You really want this, don't you?

818
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,800
I'll talk with your mom.

819
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,040
Don't worry, I won't let him out
till you're sure of him.

820
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,520
I think he's mostly bluff.

821
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,160
How you doing?

822
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,320
You got another one!

823
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,800
- His name's Alfonso.
- What?

824
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,600
He likes to fight and show off a lot.

825
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,720
You named him after me.
Thanks a lot.

826
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,120
- It's not really his real name.
- What's his real name?

827
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,040
I don't know.
I don't speak canary yet.

828
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,760
Fuck!

829
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,000
This is getting weird.

830
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,080
Didn't I tell you to stop that?

831
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,200
I told you, Mom.
It's for gym.

832
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,200
I don't know.
It looks crazy.

833
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,200
She's calling you crazy.

834
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,400
Ask her what she's been doing
with our baseballs all these years!

835
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,360
I think she buries them.
We just have to find out where.

836
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,840
I think she burns them.
We'll never find them.

837
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,720
Yeah, probably.

838
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,080
How long?

839
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,160
Same.

840
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,360
An hour.

841
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,040
I'm up to 10 pounds.

842
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,680
With that and all the weight you lost,
you could really clean up in wrestling.

843
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,280
Do you realize that's 40 pounds
of flapping power?

844
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,720
You won't fly any more than I could.

845
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,120
You couldn't fly because
you don't believe you could fly.

846
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,280
It's a snake!

847
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,920
Damn snake!

848
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,200
Got its whole foot in its mouth.

849
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,960
It must have been two feet long.

850
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,440
- I think it was a rat snake.
- I don't believe you.

851
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,960
- It was that long!
- Yeah, right.

852
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,880
Are we getting started or what?

853
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,280
Patience, Al.
You just got to have patience.

854
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,320
This place is a garbage dump.

855
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,000
Four, five, six....

856
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,240
It smells.

857
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,000
Nine, ten, eleven....

858
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,080
You sure this is going to work?

859
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
Sixteen.

860
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,000
Stop at the edge. I don't want you
or my bike in the water.

861
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,800
How about you?

862
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,640
I've been practising off my roof.

863
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,040
I can fall 20 feet
without hurting myself.

864
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,040
That's got to be
a 40-foot drop out there.

865
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,960
It's all a matter of weight
versus density.

866
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,760
At my weight,
travelling at 32 feet a second...

867
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,120
my downward velocity
won't increase after I fall 20 feet.

868
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,800
What does that mean?

869
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,320
The worst thing that can happen
is I get the wind knocked out of me.

870
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,920
It won't happen.
I'm going to fly.

871
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:57,960
How do I look?

872
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Dumb.

873
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,160
Ready.

874
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,000
Faster!

875
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,400
Faster!

876
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,160
Birdy!

877
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,360
I'm coming!

878
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,000
Just hold on!

879
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,600
Are you okay?

880
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah.

881
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,040
Are you?

882
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,200
Sure.

883
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,440
I don't know what happened.
I was going really good and just...

884
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,680
fell out of the sky.

885
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,320
Gesundheit.

886
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,400
How come every time
I tried to save your ass...

887
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,560
l ended up getting sick?

888
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,560
You thought that was funny, huh?

889
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,560
Who are you supposed to be,
the Mona Lisa or what?

890
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,160
That is a smile, isn't it?

891
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,760
" Dissociative behaviour"?

892
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,120
- A smile's a smile.
- Not necessarily.

893
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,200
It might be an involuntary manifestation
of some unconnected emotion.

894
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,400
To be significant,
it must be reactionary.

895
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,720
He was reacting.

896
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
To what?

897
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,400
- The joke.
- What joke?

898
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,680
I always got sick when he was hurt.

899
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,360
Do you think he smiled at that?

900
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,080
It's a private joke.

901
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,120
Why don't you explain it to me?

902
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,240
I don't know if I can.
It's complicated.

903
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,640
I wish this gave me hope,
but there's no concrete progress.

904
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,680
He's more responsive to drug therapy...

905
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,720
Yeah, right!

906
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,040
You pump him up so full of shit,
he doesn't know who he is!

907
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,880
Who do you think you are?

908
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,560
I'm his doctor
and your superior officer!

909
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,200
I am familiar with your
anti-authoritarian tendencies!

910
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,880
And I don't care to see them here!

911
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,440
Why do you think it's difficult for you
to control your violent impulses?

912
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,640
It's not.

913
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,840
Then why do they keep recurring?

914
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,880
Look...

915
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,040
l'm sorry.

916
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,800
I'm frustrated.

917
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,440
I just want to help my friend.

918
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,080
I don't think you can anymore.

919
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,520
I can. I know it.

920
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,840
Sorry, I don't see any point to this.

921
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,360
It's time you return to Fort Dix.

922
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,280
It's time for your bandages to come off.

923
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Excuse me.

924
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,040
Ronsky, see Sergeant Columbato out,
would you?

925
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,120
You wanted me to remember something
about his past that might help.

926
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,040
Well, there is one thing.

927
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,120
It sounds a little crazy, but...

928
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,520
He lived just over the field fence
of our baseball park.

929
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,680
When anyone hit a homer,
his mother hid the balls.

930
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,760
She wouldn't give them up.
It's weird.

931
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,920
It's almost like
he felt guilty about it.

932
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,120
He was always apologizing to somebody,
swearing he'd get their balls back.

933
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,160
It was an obsession.
He spent hours looking for them.

934
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,280
We figured maybe she buried them.

935
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,960
He never found them.
I was wondering...

936
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,960
if she sends them here,
that might do something.

937
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,800
How long ago was this?

938
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,720
All through high school, sir.

939
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,880
There must be a lot of baseballs
in that collection.

940
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,760
I'll extend your visit till
I find out about these baseballs.

941
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,240
- I hope this works.
- Me too.

942
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,840
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

943
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,400
- Just shooting some hoops.
- Fucking A!

944
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,560
Funny, any other war,
we would've been heroes.

945
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,560
Oh, man!

946
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,880
We didn't know what we were getting
into with this John Wayne shit.

947
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,480
Boy, were we dumb!

948
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,920
We were always dumb.

949
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,800
Before the government, it was
some asshole on a street corner.

950
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,840
Remember with Sagessa and the dogs?

951
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,760
Somebody buys a cute puppy
for Christmas.

952
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,200
Once they find out how much it eats
and shits, they dump it cross-town.

953
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,920
Soon you got packs of wild dogs,
big, hungry and not so cute.

954
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,080
- People want to shoot them.
- How do you find homes for the dogs?

955
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,640
If I tell you that, you don't need me.

956
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,520
You forget my dollar-a-dog proposition.
You go into business for yourself.

957
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,200
This ain't like you, Sagessa.

958
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,480
Since when were you out to make
the world better?

959
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,960
You never heard of
enlightened self-interest?

960
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,560
The way I got it figured...

961
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,240
we're doing a good deed
and making a buck besides.

962
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,280
There's one!

963
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,200
These dogs can really bite.

964
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,640
There she is! Watch this.

965
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,640
Go slow.

966
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,960
Okay, watch me now.

967
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,520
Slow and dangerous.

968
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,680
You got to let them know who you are.

969
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,840
Okay now.

970
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,120
Watch me.

971
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,280
Shit!

972
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Dollar a dog.

973
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,560
All right, we got them now.

974
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,000
I'll take this mean one.
He's the leader.

975
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,480
Damn it!

976
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,720
Shit!

977
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,680
Lift him up!

978
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,440
Grab that one.

979
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,760
Where we going?

980
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,080
That's my department. Do you want
to get out of here or what?

981
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,880
I just thought this was some...

982
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,080
You sons of bitches!
You got my dog!

983
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,800
My dog is in the goddamn truck!

984
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:29,960
He's crazy!

985
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,000
You got my dog!

986
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,040
What's your problem?

987
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,280
You got my dog in the back
of your truck, you little shit!

988
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,600
If it's his dog, you should stop
and give it to him.

989
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,760
- Bullshit, we're almost there.
- Where?

990
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,520
Jesus!

991
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,200
What is this place?

992
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,440
I've never seen so many flies.

993
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,360
What's going on here?

994
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,280
They're electrocuting them, morons!
Where's my dog?

995
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,040
Are they electrocuting these dogs?

996
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,800
It's humane, ain't it?
What do you want them to do?

997
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,120
Hit them over the head?

998
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,480
Get off my truck!
Your goddamn dog ain't here!

999
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,400
- What the fuck is going on here?!
- Get the dogs out!

1000
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,520
They're killing them
to make dog food!

1001
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,640
Dogs got to eat too.

1002
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,760
Chico, come here!

1003
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,200
Run, Birdy!

1004
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,320
What is it?

1005
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,760
The cat.

1006
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,440
I'm starting to worry I'll never fly
the way I've been going.

1007
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,840
As scary as a bird's life must be...

1008
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,160
at least they have that.

1009
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,080
They can always fly away.

1010
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,600
Do you know them damn birds
attract mice?

1011
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,960
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers
can give you asthma.

1012
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,200
Time's running out.
I'm not giving up on you.

1013
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,840
I'm going to get you to talk,
even if I have to punch you out.

1014
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,720
I'm not kidding around.
I can't hold Weiss off.

1015
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,440
I almost told him
about the flying yesterday.

1016
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,720
Goddamn it!
Why can't you listen to me?!

1017
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,320
You want to fly?

1018
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,280
He'll send you air freight
to a cage in a nut house!

1019
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,040
He'll probably send me too!

1020
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,560
We'll have perches, cups,
the whole fucking deal!

1021
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,640
Maybe your mom can dig up
your pigeon suit!

1022
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,960
Weiss can sell you to a sideshow!

1023
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,200
You can double bill
with Zimmy the Fish!

1024
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,240
All right, Birdy.

1025
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,720
It's time to start
flapping your wings and peeping.

1026
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,640
I don't believe it, you know.

1027
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,120
If you want to spend your life
as a bird, at least be consistent.

1028
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,680
Look at you.
You don't hop like a bird.

1029
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,760
You don't really sit like one.

1030
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,600
And you sure as hell
can't fly like one.

1031
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,400
If you don't like what I'm saying,
why don't you tell me to shut up?

1032
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,760
You always were hard to hurt, Birdy.

1033
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,400
Real losers never hurt.

1034
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,040
Here you go!
Here comes Hannah to feed you.

1035
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,200
You like that, don't you?

1036
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,120
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to watch you.

1037
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,280
It's fun, watching him be fed.
He's cute when he's fed.

1038
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,680
Stop taunting him.

1039
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,000
He's reacting to me!

1040
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,440
He's giving me that look.
You're pissed!

1041
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,920
Stop it! It isn't working.

1042
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,920
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.

1043
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,000
You fucked it up!
Why did you come in?

1044
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,080
I work here.
He's part of my job.

1045
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,120
Yeah? Well, he's
part of my goddamn life!

1046
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,240
Come on. Look up.

1047
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,920
Look up. Open your eyes.

1048
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,520
Can I talk to you?

1049
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,280
Back there...

1050
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,880
l didn't mean to
make you feel worse.

1051
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,920
I know he means a lot to you.

1052
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,640
It's all right.

1053
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,200
What?

1054
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,880
I'm sorry.

1055
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,920
- I didn't mean to do that to you.
- Don't be.

1056
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,760
I haven't touched
a woman in a long time.

1057
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,040
Al, it's all right.

1058
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,280
Really.

1059
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,200
I got to go.

1060
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,600
Come here.

1061
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,280
What do you want?

1062
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,200
You want to go outside?

1063
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,280
Want to go outside
and play with the other birds?

1064
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,400
You going to give me a kiss?

1065
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,560
In a dream...

1066
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,560
I'm trying to decide what I am.

1067
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,000
When I sleep,
I'm giving myself strength.

1068
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,960
I'm reaching for the force to fly.

1069
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,280
Perta waits...

1070
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,880
 cups herself to receive me.

1071
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,160
I hover...

1072
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,880
 then lower myself into her.

1073
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,920
Perta and I become one.

1074
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,720
I see through her eyes.

1075
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,800
Fly on her wings.

1076
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,480
I am no longer alone.

1077
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,200
It occurs to me...

1078
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,880
 that all I did was
put two birds in the aviary.

1079
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,160
Food and water and nothing else,
and now there are four of them.

1080
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,000
I know this is perfectly natural.

1081
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,320
It's one of the things
life is about.

1082
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,320
But to see it happen
in my bedroom...

1083
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,240
 under my own eyes...

1084
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,080
 is magic.

1085
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,560
All I want to do now
is watch the birds.

1086
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,680
I don't care about the things
that happen in the outside world.

1087
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,360
I feel turned upside down.

1088
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:40,120
Somehow the babies seem to know
their place is in the air.

1089
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,040
It must be the knowing...

1090
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,480
not the flapping of wings.

1091
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,720
Are you sleeping or what?

1092
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,760
Doris is on the phone.
She wants to talk about the prom.

1093
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,600
Don't give me that look.
I swear to you...

1094
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,040
if you don't go to the prom
like other kids...

1095
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,280
I'm getting rid of these birds!

1096
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,960
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

1097
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,360
Kind of a mess in here,
with these boys drinking.

1098
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,360
Can't hold their liquor.

1099
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,160
I was looking for you.

1100
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,720
I didn't want to embarrass you
with your date.

1101
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,160
You wouldn't embarrass me.

1102
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,440
I wanted to give you this,
so you could go someplace afterwards.

1103
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,760
Your girl there is real pretty.

1104
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,800
She's not really my girl.

1105
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,760
Thanks.

1106
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,640
Well, here we are.

1107
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,520
I'd like to keep it as a souvenir.

1108
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,160
I know you didn't want to take me.

1109
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,160
You've been very nice about it...

1110
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,080
and now you can have
what you want.

1111
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,920
I'm sorry.

1112
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,160
What?

1113
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,840
I'm not very good at this.

1114
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,360
It's okay.

1115
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,120
It doesn't matter.

1116
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,240
How do they do it?

1117
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,480
I don't know.

1118
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,240
We should go.

1119
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,720
Will I see you again?

1120
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,200
I'll see you in school on Monday.

1121
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,160
The dream is as real to me now
as my waking life.

1122
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,840
I don't know where one begins...

1123
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,840
and the other ends.

1124
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,520
I wish I could tell Al.

1125
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,920
But I'm afraid to.

1126
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,000
In my dreams...

1127
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,480
nothing holds me down.

1128
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,120
Everything is out and away.

1129
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:15,000
There's nothing in my life
to keep me here anymore.

1130
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,640
I wish I could die
and be born again as a bird.

1131
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,760
Here you go.

1132
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,360
Come on, go ahead.

1133
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,440
I'm sorry about before.

1134
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,960
You got to eat.

1135
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,040
I'll just leave it here for you.

1136
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,800
You got to come back, Birdy.

1137
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,800
Help! Help!

1138
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,240
Medics! Smitty's been hit.

1139
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,080
He's been hit!

1140
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,680
Jesus, Birdy!

1141
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,680
I'm losing it.

1142
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,760
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus

1143
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,240
Right down Santa Claus Lane
How you doing, Al?

1144
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,000
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1145
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,480
- His mother sent it to you.
- You're kidding!

1146
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,080
No, it couldn't be!

1147
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,320
I don't believe this!

1148
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,840
Okay, I got you now.

1149
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,120
Just wait till you see this.

1150
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,640
Direct from their endless
engagement in South Philadelphia.

1151
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,040
You thought you'd never see them,
but here they are!

1152
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,280
It's the baseballs!

1153
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,840
Your mom sent them.
Can you believe it?

1154
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,120
Come on!
This is it!

1155
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,080
This is your last chance!

1156
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,880
You got to give me
some kind of reaction!

1157
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,480
Come on!

1158
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,400
I need you!

1159
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,040
If Weiss gets a look inside my head,
he's going to lock me up too.

1160
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,080
I'm scared, Birdy.

1161
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,360
I'm more scared now
than I was in the war...

1162
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:39,000
and I was more scared there
than anybody I knew.

1163
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,320
Talk to me again.

1164
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,160
Hey, Birdy, where are you?

1165
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,240
Oh, no!

1166
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,680
Well, now!

1167
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,720
What happened to you?

1168
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,720
You get so hot with Doris,
you forgot to put your clothes on?

1169
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,920
If your old lady saw you like this,
she'd have a stroke.

1170
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,920
Okay, lover-boy!

1171
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:16,440
Tell me about Doris,
with plenty of details.

1172
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,520
There's nothing to tell.

1173
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,600
Don't give me this
gentleman-of-honour crap.

1174
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,600
I want to hear about last night.

1175
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,640
I'm not sure I can explain it to you.

1176
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:26,840
I knew it!
I knew she'd do it.

1177
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,000
Tell me what happened.

1178
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,840
Not with her. With me.

1179
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,600
Last night I flew.

1180
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,440
I know what
it feels like to fly.

1181
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,560
Oh, you flew?
How you flew?

1182
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,160
I'm not sure.

1183
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,240
It's not something you can
really take apart.

1184
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,600
When I fly, it's like in a dream.

1185
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,960
Only it's not a dream.

1186
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,840
You can't put it into words.
You kind of have to feel it.

1187
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,560
You can fly like a bird?

1188
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,440
When I fly...

1189
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,520
l am a bird.

1190
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,120
This is getting too weird.
You got to stop it.

1191
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,320
I thought you would understand.

1192
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,160
Well, I don't.

1193
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,480
- I don't want to hear about it.
- Why?

1194
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,240
Because I'm tired of it!

1195
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,960
We used to have fun together.

1196
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,840
Now you're always off by yourself...

1197
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,680
flying around inside
your goddamn head!

1198
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:28,400
I hope this dream,
or whatever it is, goes away.

1199
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,040
I think it's bullshit.

1200
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,640
I shouldn't have said that.

1201
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,800
I shouldn't have left you then.

1202
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,400
It's working.
He just needs a little more time.

1203
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,440
I'm not blind.

1204
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,560
I'm sorry the baseballs didn't work.

1205
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,720
There's no sense
in going on with this.

1206
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,680
His condition is deteriorating.

1207
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,800
He hardly moves anymore.
He's stopped eating.

1208
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,800
We'll have to put him on an IV.

1209
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,840
- I could stay and...
- You should be back at Fort Dix.

1210
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,400
There's nothing to keep you
here any longer.

1211
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,080
I just want to say goodbye.

1212
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,040
Go ahead.

1213
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,480
Alone.

1214
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,880
I'll see you in my office afterwards.

1215
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,880
Perta! Come back!

1216
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,920
Don't worry.

1217
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,280
I'm not leaving you again.

1218
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,760
You all right?

1219
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,080
Doctor Weiss asked me
to come and get you.

1220
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,760
I'm not leaving him.

1221
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:28,040
- They're not going to let you stay.
- Why not?

1222
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,440
Don't you have to go back
to the hospital?

1223
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,240
I'm not going back.

1224
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,040
Come outside and we can talk.

1225
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,840
I don't want to talk.

1226
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,080
That's all I've done
since I've been here.

1227
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,800
Besides, nobody listens to anybody
anyway, even if they aren't crazy.

1228
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,720
You go tell Weiss
I'm staying with my friend.

1229
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,000
Tell him!

1230
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,520
Don't worry, they can't
make me leave you.

1231
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,760
I can't go out there.

1232
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,520
I couldn't make it.

1233
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,920
They got the best of us, Birdy.

1234
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,040
We're both totally screwed up.

1235
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,960
We haven't had anything to do
with making our own lives. Fuck!

1236
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,520
I was always so damned sure...

1237
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,640
about being myself...

1238
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:37,840
and how nobody was going to
make me do anything I didn't want.

1239
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,400
And now, here I am.

1240
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,120
They finish you off with a discharge
or put you on a casualty list.

1241
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,480
It doesn't matter
how special you are or were.

1242
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,800
I feel like one of those dogs
nobody wanted, remember?

1243
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:00,120
You know, when that shell
went off in my face...

1244
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,800
l could smell burning flesh.

1245
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,600
And it was crazy...

1246
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,920
because the smell was so sweet...

1247
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,800
so familiar.

1248
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,800
Then I realized that it was
my own skin that was frying.

1249
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,720
And I couldn't even touch the pain.

1250
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,640
I don't even know
what I look like anymore.

1251
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,680
I don't know if it's me
under these bandages...

1252
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,760
or what some Army meat-cutter
thinks is me.

1253
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:42,080
I don't want a patched-up,
instant-pity excuse for a face.

1254
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:47,000
I just want it to be AI under here.

1255
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:50,360
Not some sewn-together freak mask.

1256
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,040
Shit!

1257
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,320
What's so great about
their fucking world anyway?

1258
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,000
We'll just stay here
and keep the hell out of it.

1259
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,120
I don't have to go get
these bandages off.

1260
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,720
I figured out what you're doing.

1261
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:11,920
You're right.

1262
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,520
We should just hide out
and not talk with anybody.

1263
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,440
And every so often...

1264
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,720
go crazy...

1265
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,200
and run up the wall...

1266
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,720
and spit!

1267
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,520
And throw shit at them,
like the loony across the hall!

1268
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,280
That's what we can do.

1269
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,600
That's what we can do.

1270
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,480
Sometimes you're so full of shit.

1271
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:44,560
Was that you?

1272
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,760
It was!

1273
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,240
You talked!
It's really you!

1274
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,760
I can't believe it.
Say something else.

1275
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:00,040
I can't believe it.
It's really you!

1276
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,760
How come you decided to talk?

1277
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,360
I didn't decide.

1278
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,360
It just happened.
I don't know.

1279
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,080
You needed me, didn't you?

1280
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,920
They think we're both crazy.

1281
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:10,960
What's going on?

1282
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,560
He talked!
Come on, say something.

1283
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,080
Goddamn it, talk!

1284
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,240
- He talked before.
- This won't work.

1285
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,200
I'm telling the truth!
What are you doing, dumbshit?

1286
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:24,080
Don't you know
they'll keep you forever?!

1287
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,000
Goddamn it, talk!

1288
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,560
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Birdy, talk!

1289
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,040
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Goddamn it!

1290
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,200
I'm staying here with him!

1291
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,840
This isn't a game anymore.
Why wouldn't you talk?

1292
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,160
I didn't have anything to say to him.

1293
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,320
What are you, crazy?

1294
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,440
We have to get out of here.

1295
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:56,160
Come on!

1296
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,120
Birdy, don't!

1297
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:02,320
What?
