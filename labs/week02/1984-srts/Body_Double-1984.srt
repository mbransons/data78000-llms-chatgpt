8
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,275
What are you doing?

9
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,471
There's a woman being killed up here.

10
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,079
Come on.

Please don't.

18
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,114
Get him off of me. He's killing me!

19
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,109
Stop!

20

l'm in charge of this investigation.

22
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,151
l see you're an actor.

23
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,952
Ever been in anything?

24
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,635
<i>Emerald Point</i> and a <i>Hart to Hart</i>
that was pretty good.

25
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,229
Very interesting.

26
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,158
You make a living?

27
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,391
Good-looking boy.

28
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,193
Talented.

29
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,952
Scully, l got a real problem with you.

30
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,394
What do you mean?

31
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,797
l mean, you're my only witness
to this murder.

32
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,036
And you're a peeper.

33
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,357
ln my book that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

34
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,989
-What do you mean, ''a sex offender''?
-Save it.

35
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,077
l ask the questions.

36
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,353
What about this lndian? He snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back for her?

37
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,153
That's right.

38
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,078
Was anything missing?

39
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,158
Well, l saw him take a credit card.

40
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,432
Not a credit card. A card key, Scully.

41
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,837
He used it to get into her house.

42
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,759
Did Gloria know it was missing?

43
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,594
l don't know.
She didn't say anything to me.

44
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,077
You talked to her?

45
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,278
Come on, Scully,
you must have said something.

46
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,954
-lt was just small talk, you know.
-No, l don't know.

47
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,749
Did you come on to her?
Trying to do a number on her head?

48
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,793
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her life.

49
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,998
Then why were you following
Gloria Revelle?

50
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,795
Because l got concerned
when l saw that guy following her.

51
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,358
-You kept on her after he disappeared.
-l know, l know, because....

52
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,391
l guess, l wanted to....

53
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,159
You wanted to what?

54
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,268
Nothing.

55
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,508
What's this?

56
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,716
Pants. Some underpants.

57
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,234
Yours?

58
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,873
Where'd you get them?

59
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,835
-She dropped them in the trash.
-Who?

60
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,189
Gloria.

61
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,436
And you just picked them up.

62
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,910
Why?

63
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,158
Come on, Scully, tell the truth.

64
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

65
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,637
No, you didn't fuck her? Or no,
you didn't keep them as a souvenir?

66
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,356
-You're just a harmless panty sniffer?
-You got a dirty mind.

67
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,476
That's a laugh.

68
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,389
You peep on her, follow her,
fuck her, keep her panties...

69
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,195
-...then watch her being slaughtered.
-You're twisting everything around!

70
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,914
l tried to save her!

71
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,678
Some save, Scully.

72
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,479
Some save.

73
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,270
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

74
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,392
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

75
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,469
What?

76
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,434
Alexander Revelle.
You know, Gloria's husband.

77
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,313
Friend of yours?

78
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,518
No, l never met him.

79
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,914
-You sure?
-Yeah, l'm sure.

80
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,633
Was he around when Gloria got nailed?

81
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,753
You think he had something
to do with it?

82
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,194
Gloria Revelle was a rich lady.

83
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,038
Very rich.

84
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,396
When rich wives get dead...

85
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,069
...l usually go after the husband.

86
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,753
The only problem is, you saw a thief.

87
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,275
An lndian killed Gloria Revelle.

88
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,590
l'm not gonna hold you, Scully.

89
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,438
You got witnesses
to back up your story.

90
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,232
But l want you to think real hard
about this.

91
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,991
As far as l'm concerned, you're
the reason she got murdered.

92
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,870
lf you hadn't been so busy
getting off by peeping on her...

93
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,755
...if you'd called the police about
your blood brother, the lndian...

94
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,673
...Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

95
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,150

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,708
Go ahead.

158
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,198
l like to watch.

159
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,916
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

160
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,551
Makes me hot too. Real hot.

161
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,435
Come over here,
l'll show you how hot.

162
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,948
All right.

163
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,879
Take off your clothes.
l want to take some pictures.

164
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,870
What is it that we're watching?

165
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,115
l don't know.

166
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,153
What are you,
some kind of method actor?

167
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,909
<i>Give it to me one time now</i>

168
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,109
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna go to it</i>

169
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,154
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna come</i>

170
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,154
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna suck it to it</i>

171
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,829
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>

172
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,959
<i>When you wanna come</i>

173
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,716
<i>When you wanna come</i>

174
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,069
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna go to it</i>

175
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,069
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna come</i>

176
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,069
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>
<i>When you wanna suck it to it</i>

177
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,952
<i>Relax, don't do it</i>

178
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,152
<i>When you wanna come</i>

179
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,430
l like to watch.

180
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,275
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

181
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,516
Makes me hot too.

182
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,110
Why don't you come over here,
and l'll show you how hot.

183
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,352
Where's the come shot?

184
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,118
l thought we were doing
<i>Body Talk,</i> not <i>Last Tango.</i>

185
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,389
You were great out there.
Come on, l'll buy you a drink.

186
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,748
A drink? l don't even know you.

187
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,554
Hey, l'm talking business.

188
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,829
Come on.

189
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,997
You know the mirror out there?

190
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,950
That was my idea.

191
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,557
So you're a genius.

192
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,756
But l can make a better film
than Corso with my eyes closed.

193
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,156
Films cost money, you know.

194
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,953
l got money.

195
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,555
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

196
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,313
l wanted to meet you.

197
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,715
Why?

198
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,354
Because l think you're sensational.
You're the best in the business.

199
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,955
l'll pay you top dollar.
l'll give you points.

200
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,152
Whatever it takes.

201
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,349
Really?

202
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,788
l want you in my picture.

203
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,870
-You're really serious?
-Of course l am.

204
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,354
Okay, good.

205
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,593
There are some things l like
to get straight up front...

206
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,552
...so there are no misunderstandings.

207
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,755
l don't blame you.

208
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,473
l do not do animal acts.

209
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,594
l don't do S & M or any variations
of that particular bent.

210
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,233
No watersports, either.

211
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,750
l will not shave my pussy,
no fist-fucking...

212
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,315
...and absolutely
no coming in my face.

213
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,959
l get $2,000 a day,
and l don't work without a contract.

214
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,148
Fine. l mean, that's no problem.

215
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,752
l think we got a deal.

216
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,350
You ever do any special work?

217
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,630
What kind are you looking for?

218
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,354
A woman alone.

219
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,392
Getting herself off.

220
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,073
lt's gotta be really hot.

221
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,830
ls that all?

222
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,870
l have a routine that is
a sure 1 0 on the peter-metre.

223
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,751
l know. l've seen it.

224
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,393
A few times.

225
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,749
l'm known far and wide
for that little bit of business.

226
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,077
l want you to know
l saw <i>Holly Does Hollywood...</i>

227
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,398
...and your acting was top-drawer.

228
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,590
My acting?

229
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,398
You're fantastic.

230
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,591
Really sensational.

231
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,757
And l'll tell you something else.

232
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,909
-You've got a terrific--
-Body.

233
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,795
Smile.

234
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,879
Smile?

235
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,159
Jake?

236
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,278
Jake Scully! Look at you.

237
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,353
-Kimberly, how are you?
-l'm fine. Just lovely.

238
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,389
Aren't you going to
introduce me to your friend?

239
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,433
-Holly Body.
-Kimberly Hess.

240
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,431
So, Jake, you working?

241
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,955
Here and there.
We gotta run.

242
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,394
Great to see you.

243
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,036
Jake and l worked together
a few times in the past.

244
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,517
l thought l knew everybody
in this business.

245
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,228
Really?

246
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,988
l don't see how someone
could know everyone.

247
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,913
Well, it's a funny business.

248
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,839
l wanted to ask you...

249
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,749
...have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...?

250
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,150
l have. l have a tip for you.

251
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,675
Simon La Farge is just casting
his picture. You know him, right?

252
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,560
Where you from, outer space?

253
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,837
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

254
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,999
You might want to firm up a little bit
before you go and see him.

255
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,876
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

256
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,999
Well, no. l mean,
acting is acting, right?

257
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,471
That's right.
l think that's really admirable.

258
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,479
l mean, me myself,
l can't get into it. But....

259
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,876
Good luck and say hello
to Simon for me.

260
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,038
-Good seeing you.
-Sure. Thanks.

261
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,116
By the way...

262
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,839
...what's the film about?

263
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,589
That's good.

264
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,316
We need more comedians
in our business. Good luck.

265
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,713
Very nice.

266
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,554
What can l get you?
Jack Daniel's?

267
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,954
How about Jake Scully...

268
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,958
...straight up?

269
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,912
Very funny.

270
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,154
Listen, Holly....

271
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,158
l don't want to talk
anymore business.

272
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,954
Yeah, well, listen....

273
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,832
Lie down.

274
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,712
We had one of these in <i>Star Whores.</i>

275
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,356
There's something l gotta tell you.

276
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,359
You're married.

277
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,034
l'm not a producer.

278
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,157
You're not a producer.

279
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,639
Just a second.

280
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,357
l'm not interested
in making a film with you.

281
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,358
-What are you interested in then?
-You.

282
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,757
l saw you in the house
those other nights.

283
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,953
What house?

284
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,799
You know, that little show
you put on...

285
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,756
...with the masturbation routine and
the diamonds. l watched you from here.

286
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,233
You were the girl
in the window, right?

287
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,753
That wasn't Gloria, that was you.

288
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,394
What's it to you?

289
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,196
Just tell me if l'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

290
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,869
Right?

291
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,398
l'm not saying it was me,
and l'm not saying it wasn't me.

292
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,638
l'm saying, why are you
interested in knowing?

293
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,159
l think that...

294
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,990
...one of my crazy friends
played a practical joke on me.

295
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,396
You know how it is with the idle rich.

296
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,155
Tell me, okay? Tell me...

297
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,476
...were you the girl in the house?

298
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,349
-Yeah, it was me.
-l knew it. How did this get set up?

299
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,279
Tell me, just to satisfy my curiosity,
because one of my....

300
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,552
One of my crazy friends set this up,
and l don't know who.

301
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,037
-Who hired you?
-You were the one l was playing to?

302
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,350
And there's no part for me?

303
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,430
-l'm sorry.
-So this whole thing was a joke.

304
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,750
lt was a practical joke on me.

305
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,516
Did Sam Bouchard set this thing up?
Did he hire you to do your routine?

306
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,955
He didn't tell me his name.

307
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,432
Well, whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

308
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,235
This guy called me up and said
he'd seen my self-help routine...

309
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,839
...in <i>Holly Does Hollywood...</i>

310
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,156
...and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

311
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,190
He said he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

312
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,189
-He didn't tell you who he was?
-No, he didn't tell me his name.

313
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,598
He just sent a messenger
over with money...

314
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,553
...and with a card key...

315
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,636
...and a wig.

316
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,151
Please don't leave, okay?
Stay here for a second.

317
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,156
Can you hold on?

318
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,715
<i>-Jake, it's Sam. How's it going?</i>
-How are you doing? Can you hold on?

319
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,398
Listen to this guy's voice...

320
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
...and tell me if he's the one
that hired you.

321
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,190
Please?

322
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,034
Sorry, you got me in the shower.
How you doing?

323
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,198
<i>I'm afraid I've got</i>
<i>some bad news for you, pal.</i>

324
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,230
What's that?

325
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,354
<i>Seattle Rep and I had some differences.</i>
<i>I'm heading back to L.A.</i>

326
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,149
<i>I guess you'll have to</i>
<i>find another place to crash.</i>

327
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,355
That's him.

328
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,669
<i>You got company?</i>

329
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,394
l do. lt's kind of
a bad time to talk.

330
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,353
You want to call me back
in about 1 5 minutes?

331
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,558
That was the guy who hired you?

332
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,149
-Are you sure?
-l'm sure that was him.

333
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,992
-Listen.
-You're really sick!

334
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,555
-Listen to me.
-lf this is your idea of fun--

335
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,598
l am not a film producer
and l am not a rich kid.

336
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,552
No, you're a jerk.

337
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,189
Please just listen
to me for a second.

338
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,033
You were hired to come in
and do two nights' work.

339
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,278
You were hired to do your routine
and leave. ls that true?

340
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,755
-Do you know why?
-You just told me why.

341
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,673
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

342
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,393
He wasn't playing a joke on you.

343
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,989
Do you now want
to tell me what it was?

344
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,676
The truth, Holly.

345
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,349
The truth is a woman was murdered.

346
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,519
lt's not funny! A woman was murdered.
We were set up by a murderer!

347
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,475
He wanted to be sure l witnessed
the murder. That's why he hired you.

348
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,830
He arranged it
so that l'd be watching.

349
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,272
He wanted me to think Gloria Revelle
was the one who was getting off.

350
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,950
Meanwhile, he thought
l'd watch and keep watching.

351
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,757
Are you listening to me?

352
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,476
l don't understand what you've said--

353
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,228
Listen, the man who hired you
is a murderer!

354
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,475
Here, come here.

355
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,309
Please come here.

356
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,950
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

357
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,755
See that house down there?
That's where you were, right?

358
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,030
-Now do you understand?
-Yes, l understand.

359
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,709
l understand you're sick.
And you're a liar.

360
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,468
You need help.
And l don't like being yelled at.

361
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,194
l should've known when
you said l had a nice smile.

362
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,192
No real producer would say that!

363
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,152
Now get out of my way.

364
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,992
-What?
-Come with me to the police.

365
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,078
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen, you weirdo.

366
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,672
l'm leaving and don't follow me.
l have friends who'll break your legs!

367
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,075
Let go of me! Christ!

368
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,471
Weirdo! l should know better.
lt's Hollywood!

369
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,275
Could l have the Hollywood police?

370
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,950
Fucking freaky actors!
That's what there is here.

371
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,549
Masochistic directors.

372
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,718
l should've known when he didn't
know what a come shot was.

373
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,478
Detective McLean, please.

374
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,309
Excuse me. Stop, please?

375
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,550
Thank you very much, lady!

376
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,630
l was set up.

377
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,637
Hollywood's busiest sex offender.

378
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,953
Listen to me for a minute.
l got something important to tell you.

379
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,398
l know who killed Gloria Revelle.

380
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,075
ls this a confession?

381
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,392
Just pay attention, all right?

382
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,035
A few days ago, l was
looking for an apartment.

383
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,158
Do you know any sublets
available right away?

384
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,919
No. l'll check around.

385
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,559
<i>Then I noticed this guy.</i>

386
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,152
<i>Sam Bouchard. He was looking for</i>
<i>somebody who needed a place to stay.</i>

387
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,995
<i>I thought it was a coincidence</i>
<i>we kept running into each other.</i>

388
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,996
Hi, again.

389
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,199
<i>Anyway, now I realize...</i>

390
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,718
<i>...he was throwing out a net,</i>
<i>sizing me up for a part he was casting.</i>

391
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,150
l want you to cry out for help!

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,230
l can't.

393
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,357
<i>And I fit the bill perfectly.</i>

394
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,949
<i>Lovesick sucker, out on his ass.</i>

395
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,316
Shit, what a fool l am.

396
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,189
You know what the part was?

397
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,750
l'm listening.

398
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,158
The part of the witness.

399
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,189
<i>He said there was a neighbour that</i>
<i>did a number on herself every night.</i>

400
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,079
<i>He knew I'd look.</i>

401
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,270
Nice, huh?

402
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,555
<i>He knew I'd keep looking.</i>

403
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,229
<i>It wasn't Gloria, it was Holly.</i>
<i>That's why I never saw her face.</i>

404
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,878
You sound like one of those
conspiracy nuts, plots all around you.

405
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,634
Please just listen to me for a second.

406
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,757
Sam Bouchard is Alexander Revelle.

407
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,916
<i>He hired the Indian</i>
<i>to follow Gloria...</i>

408
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,873
<i>...snatch her purse and</i>
<i>steal the key to her house...</i>

409
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,071
<i>...and then sneak inside.</i>

410
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,875
<i>When she got home, the Indian opened</i>
<i>the blinds so I'd see him kill her.</i>

411
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,637
Alexander Revelle set me up
in this house to witness the murder.

412
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,029
<i>And he hired a porno actress</i>
<i>to be the bait.</i>

413
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,710
Can l have a ride, please?

414
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,110
Thanks a lot, you jerks! God!

415
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,955
Oh, my God!

416
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,556
l've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along.

417
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,076
The reason it hasn't panned out
is because of your testimony...

418
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,351
...that Gloria was killed by an lndian.

419
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,069
That's it, don't you see?
That's what he wanted.

420
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,353
lt looks like a burglary but
it's a murder with me as the witness.

421
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,239
l'm Sam's--
l mean, Alexander Revelle's alibi.

422
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,511
Listen. Stop, all right?

423
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,869
Stop right there!

424
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,678
There has been an accident up there.

425
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,599
-People are probably hurt.
-Slow down, lady.

426
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,950
-And nobody's bothered to stop.
-Get in.

427
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,873
lt sounds crazy to me.

428
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,154
l know.

429
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,789
But it's the truth.

430
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,109
Maybe you'd better come down here.

431
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,036
Pull it up. Pull your car
right up here, nice and slow.

432
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,751
All right, stay in your car, please.

433
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,958
We'll have it cleaned up in a minute.

434
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,275
Nothing to look at.

435
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,913
Get back in your car, please.

436
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,794
There's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco.

437
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,949
He hit her on the head with something.

438
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,673
We gotta help her!

439
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,474
Get back in your car.

440
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,472
He hit her in the back--

441
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,317
l don't have time to run you in.

442
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,632
Please, he's getting away.
Call somebody on the radio.

443
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,510
Don't you understand?
l saw him killing her.

444
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,872
-You fucking idiot!
-That's it. You're coming with me.

445
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,112
Call Detective McLean.
He knows all about this.

446
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,198
Come here, you son of a bitch!

447
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,872
Holly, are you okay?

448
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,277
Look what you did.

449
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,596
You ruined my surprise ending!

450
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,469
l gave you your part.

451
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,273
The witness.

452
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,272
You were perfect.

453
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,112
You played it to a tee.

454
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,873
But that was it. End of part.

455
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,112
Wrap Jake Scully.

456
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,512
You had to play the hero...

457
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,272
...improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

458
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,596
...unmasking the lndian.

459
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,589
But you didn't think it through,
did you, Jake?

460
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,113
Sometimes heroes come to tragic ends.

461
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,676
What's the matter, Jake?

462
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,672
A little short of breath?

463
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,552
What a terrible way to die.

464
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,872
Especially when
you're so claustrophobic.

465
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,270
Wait a minute.

466
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,349
l'm gonna give you another take, Jake.

467
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,273
The only problem is
you've got to act.

468
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,074
Come on, Jake.

469
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,359
Action.

470
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,794
Action.

471
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,279
And action.

472
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,239
Jake, action.

473
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,718
Cut! Get him out.
Move the camera.

474
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,069
Joe, give me a hand.

475
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,715
Just take it easy.
Something's going on.

476
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,230
Take it easy.
We're getting you out.

477
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,676
We got you.
Don't worry about it.

478
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,912
-That's all right.
-We're here.

479
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,636
Give him some air.
Talk to me, talk to me.

480
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,871
Walk it off.
Just go for a walk.

481
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,873
Just relax, just breathe in.
Give him some air.

482
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,832
All right, that's good.

483
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,311
What's the matter, babe?
You had us scared.

484
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,079
What's the problem?

485
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,431
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

486
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,510
Get away from me.

487
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,268
Just relax.
We're trying to help you.

488
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,358
l know.
l can help myself.

489
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,874
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

490
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,272
Go on home and we'll shoot this
another time, all right?

491
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,276
Don't lie to me. lf l don't get
this shot, you're going to fire me.

492
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,678
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would l do a thing like that?

493
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,991
Save the speech. l know about your
personal commitment to the actors.

494
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,636
So l'm a little claustrophobic.
You'll work around it, right?

495
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,279
Yeah, that's right.

496
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,471
l don't think l like your attitude.

497
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,070
lf l get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

498
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,679
Let's do it!

499
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,275
And Jake, you'd better
get it right this time.

500
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,472
You're one pain in the ass
l don't need.

501
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,793
Roll sound. Quiet.

502
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,668
<i>And action!</i>

503
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,999
You bastard!

504
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,639
Don't be so melodramatic.

505
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,956
Kill! Kill!

506
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,472
What are you doing?

507
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,434
-What am l doing? l'm saving you.
-From who?

508
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,276
Listen.
The lndian was Sam Bouchard.

509
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,712
Am l missing something?
ls somebody here l don't see?

510
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,520
Yes, the dog knocked him in.

511
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,915
Come here, Holly.

512
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,230
Look, he must have knocked him in.

513
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,072
l thought it belonged to Gloria but
it must have belonged to the husband.

514
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,278
That's why he never barked
at the lndian in the house.

515
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,028
You're right.
We should go to the police.

516
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,514
Really? You believe me?

517
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,912
l believe you're a number one sicko
and should be put away for life.

518
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,751
l know all about you guys.
l've seen about you on television.

519
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,468
You're one of those necrophiliacs.
A corpse fucker!

520
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,670
l am not.

521
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,912
l turn you on all right.
The problem is l'm still moving.

522
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,628
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better.

523
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,072
Holly, are you all right?

524
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,550
Take my hand.

525
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,592
Do not touch me!
l'm not dead yet.

526
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,352
This all seems crazy,
but you've gotta believe me.

527
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,278
l'm trying to help you.

528
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,478
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

529
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,236
Freeze. Don't move your hand.
How's it look, Doug?

530
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,799
Good. Hold that move.

531
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,311
All right, let's 86 the bat.
lt's a wrap on the bat.

532
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,709
Get the bat out.

533
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,150
l gotta hold the hand really still.

534
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,510
Help him out.
Turn the water off.

535
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,392
Can l slip out?

536
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,672
Wait till we get the bar in there.

537
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,670
Between the bottom two fingers.

538
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,394
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

539
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,716
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

540
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,752
Makeup.
Touchup for Jake.

541
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,912
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

542
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,753
Don't move the bar!

543
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,274
-l'm sorry.
-That's okay.

544
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,195
You look great.

545
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,677
-Did l flash the teeth enough?
-Best teeth flashing l've seen.

546
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,075
Beautiful, babe.

547
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,875
l'm glad l fired that other asshole.
This part was made for you.

548
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,189
You look sensational.

549
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,074
The bar's falling.
l can't believe l'm holding it.

550
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,514
You getting tired?

551
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,153
Just a little longer.

552
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,670
Bring in the body double.

553
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,593
The hair looks good.

554
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,677

Let's take the bar out.
