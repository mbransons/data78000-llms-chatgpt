1
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,892
If they only were Rudy,
I wouldn't take another step.

2
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:34,328
But there's only one Rudy.

3
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:35,956
She's a bit of all right.

4
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,627
She's driving me completely mad,
that's for sure.

5
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,999
Just one Rudy...

6
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,669
...and so many millions
and millions of us.

7
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,049
Let's get out of here!

8
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,175
Hurry up, Mac! They're coming!

9
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:58,215
Here they come!

10
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:00,747
Hurry!

11
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:03,623
Be my sheba and ride with me...

12
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,184
- Yes, yes, yes!
...over the sand dunes.

13
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:07,958
Kiss me, Rudy!
Kiss me quickly!

14
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:18,298
God, I could've loved her.

15
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,569
I could've, too.

16
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:24,206
Do you realize that tomorrow
we are finally free?

17
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:27,375
We can actually ride
across the sand dunes and be loved.

18
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,079
Actually lie down and be loved.

19
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:33,385
We're so overdue,
as we both know too well.

20
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:34,981
Everything in its time, Mac.

21
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:39,189
We are now possibly the most
overeducated young women in the country.

22
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:42,255
But in the ways of love,
we're kindergarten toddlers!

23
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:44,527
Cat, fantastic idea...

24
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,399
let's not start
our graduation trip in Paris.

25
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,631
- God.
- No.

26
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:51,538
Let's start... I love this...

27
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:55,874
let's start by galloping across
the burning sand dunes of Morocco

28
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,471
in the arms of a real sheik!

29
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,415
Yes. We can spend our nights
learning of ecstasy.

30
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,981
What a beautiful word... ecstasy.

31
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:09,492
- E-X-T...
- No, no, no.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,290
- E-C-S-T...
- Let's go wallow in it!

33
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,091
Mac, I don't know.

34
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,927
No... you're serious?

35
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,591
Do the backstroke in it!

36
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:19,795
- You are serious.
- Then you'll go?

37
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,201
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

38
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,205
Good! I don't like choices.

39
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,833
Congratulations to you, Miss Pipps.

40
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:30,240
Tomorrow the Sahara.

41
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:32,248
Blood on the sand.

42
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,850
Well done, Miss McGillvary.

43
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,791
Cotton, stop the car.
Stop the car!

44
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,397
I just have to do something
that I've been dreaming about for years.

46
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,567
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,984
Who's that?

48
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:19,614
I believe that's the attorney.

49
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,920
What's he so happy about?

50
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:24,483
He probably liked the entertainment.

51
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:28,697
Cotton, I'm so sorry.

52
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,733
I've embarrassed you.

53
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,106
How awful for you.

54
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,367
But, you see, I just had to do this.

55
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:43,675
I had so many years
of being so very, very proper,

56
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,977
I got claustrophobia!

57
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,078
You're terribly embarrassed.

58
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,313
Can you ever forgive me?

59
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:53,219
That's not my position.

60
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,190
Not your position?

61
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,783
No, miss.

62
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,927
You mean because you drive
that great big car

63
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:03,899
you cannot not forgive a person
for something?

64
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,731
That more or less covers it.

65
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,703
Because you drive the car?

66
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,501
Yes.

67
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,041
Then I'll drive the car.

68
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:15,601
Now, you can or cannot forgive me?

69
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,847
You'll drive the car?

70
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:20,212
Does that mean that I'm fired?

71
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:23,746
If that's what it takes
to allow you to answer.

72
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:28,685
I haven't been without a job
since I was 13 years old.

73
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,592
Okay, okay.
What was the question?

74
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:37,031
Oh, yes. Do I forgive you
for having embarrassed me?

75
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,761
That was the question.

76
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,769
At first, I was puzzled.

77
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:43,135
Then, well, then...

78
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,538
- You were embarrassed.
- No.

79
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm glad.

80
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,071
No, I was amazed
at how much you'd changed

81
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,707
since the last time I saw you
without any clothes.

82
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:57,446
- Without any cl...
- I think you were three or four.

83
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,818
You've grown well.

84
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,187
I think that was nicely said.

85
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,761
Now, would you like your old job back?

86
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,921
Is it still available?

87
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:10,296
It is if you'll be my friend
and talk to me.

88
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,426
I haven't much to say.

89
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,833
But you'll say it?

90
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:18,607
Let's get the hell out of here.

91
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,943
He's a pretty spiffy-looking attorney.

92
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:32,045
I believe today's the day
I become an excessively rich little bitch.

93
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,987
You'll still be my friend, Cotton.

94
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,048
If that's the only way
I can keep my job.

95
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,650
That's the only way.

96
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,689
A pretty tough way to keep a job.

97
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:43,528
Well, I'm told life is not easy.

98
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,094
Hi.

99
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:51,065
Miss Ayre McGillvary,
I am Robert Stewart,

100
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,803
one of your late father's army
of solicitors.

101
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,107
I mean you no disrespect...

102
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,044
not at all, to the contrary...

103
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,980
but I wish when I had graduated,

104
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,245
I'd been cheeky enough to do
what you did.

105
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,786
Bloody marvelous.

106
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:07,521
I give you my diploma,
and you give me what?

107
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,424
Gee whiz, it's Cotton.

108
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,263
I think I own the whole world.

109
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,530
Well, at least all the good parts of it.

110
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:25,567
Now we must watch our steps,
in every sense of the word,

111
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:28,167
as we wind our way to the casbah.

112
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,269
Come.

113
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,541
We should have a policeman with us.

114
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,416
Don't you think we should have
a policeman with us?

115
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,974
They wouldn't be welcome here.

116
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:38,816
Actually, it is more dangerous
for them than for you.

117
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,016
Life is not without its risks,

118
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:44,185
compounded, of course, a bit more
here in the casbah.

119
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:46,923
Hey, Mohammed!
Look, look, look, look!

120
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,494
I am still eh-scared.

121
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,128
Oh, Cat! I'll protect you
with my life if necessary.

122
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,001
Protect me?
You're half naked.

123
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,767
They will get you first.

124
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,741
No. No... They'll what?

125
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,744
Make you no more a virgin.

126
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,973
Well, isn't that what we're here for?

127
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:11,114
This door... it may this very night
hold in its bosom your sheik.

128
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,617
Shall we see?

129
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:18,191
We can ask Allah
for one authentic sheik.

130
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:20,161
Two, if he would be so kind.

131
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,076
I like that.

132
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,789
Don't you like that, Cat?

133
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,887
I like that.

134
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,553
Yeah, I like it.

135
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,653
Come.

136
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,240
So sweet.

137
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,118
Sweet!

138
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,585
He's beautiful.

139
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:27,921
Catalina, look.

140
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:29,932
- Mac, look at that!
- Look!

141
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:35,502
What do the camels do?

142
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,566
They are for sale.

143
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,736
Cotton, wouldn't you just love one?

144
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,540
"Love" may be too strong a word.

145
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,072
Allah is kind.

146
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,878
Miss, your sheik.

147
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,213
Miss, your sheik!

148
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:50,344
A sheik?

149
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,183
Yes. He is a young one.

150
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,155
A pup, you might say.

151
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,991
He comes from the south,

152
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,791
across uncountable miles of sand.

153
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:04,823
His father... his father's a great pasha.

154
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:08,200
- Catalina, do you see him?
- No.

155
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,568
Well, look!

156
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:13,941
He could be your sister.

157
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:21,178
Miss, would you like
to meet the sheik now?

158
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,751
I'll wait here, thank you.

159
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,220
If you'll stay with me, Cotton.

160
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,916
We'll stay here.

161
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,856
You're not gonna pass on a real sheik!

162
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,120
There is only one.

163
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:35,290
Being beginners, that's probably
enough for both of us right now.

164
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:38,994
But if you're too "eh-scared,"
I'll brave this one myself.

165
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,434
Okay.

166
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:41,868
We wait?

167
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,497
Go.

168
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:09,498
Honorable Sheik, allow me
to introduce this American lady to you.

169
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,161
She has come all the way
from her country just to meet you.

170
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,432
How do you do?

171
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,109
Well, thank you.
And you?

172
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,509
You are a vision.

173
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,710
Thank you.

174
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:28,273
You may go now.

175
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,080
Miss McGillvary?

176
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:31,643
Thank you. I'll be fine.

177
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:34,246
Please tell my friends
I'll rejoin them in a minute.

178
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,689
As you wish.

179
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,832
Sit here, if you like.

180
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,527
Please.

181
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,903
I never dreamed
that there was anyone...

182
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:58,812
anyone on this Earth like you,

183
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:03,444
and if there was,
I should ever look upon her.

184
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,321
And now I am.

185
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,017
Allah is being too kind.

186
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,560
No, it is you that is too kind.

187
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:13,858
What did that man say?

188
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:17,229
You've come to meet me?

189
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:18,958
Yes.

190
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:23,170
Why? May I know why?

191
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,772
Well, it's a long story.

192
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:29,903
Does it have a short answer?

193
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:32,307
Yes, it does.

194
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:35,317
Is it possible that I may hear it?

195
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,316
Well, it's going to sound
so stupid now.

196
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,857
I have come all this way

197
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:45,224
to give you something
you may not even want.

198
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,425
My virginity.

199
00:13:56,172 --> 00:14:00,040
I've never been given this gift before.

200
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,407
Is it true?

201
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,076
Will you take the gift?

202
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:10,016
This very night.

203
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:14,548
You will come with me to my palace,

204
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,856
and I will take your gift
with great happiness.

205
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:23,262
I had dreamed of a beautiful tent
and desert.

206
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:27,903
I can give you the whole golden Sahara
and a thousand tents.

207
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,372
We leave tonight.

208
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,702
It's not too far?

209
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:33,841
I have an aeroplane.

210
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,400
You have an aeroplane?

211
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,578
How else could I fly you?

212
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,440
Of course.

213
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,445
Is it possible we could go tomorrow?

214
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:50,249
I'll be carrying the same gift with me?

215
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:53,062
Only a day older.

216
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,793
- Do you think I'm mad, Cotton?
- No, not mad.

217
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,528
Or maybe bad?

218
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,695
- The truth?
- Can I take it?

219
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:04,501
- I envy your spirit.
- Thank you.

220
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:06,940
- Now, this is a parachute.
- Okay.

221
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,535
- I'm gonna buckle it right here.
- All right.

222
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,477
- I don't want you to use it.
- No.

223
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:14,312
But if you have to,
you pull this little ring right there.

224
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:16,249
Okay, okay.

225
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,583
I'll save the biggest piece
of the cake for you.

226
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,284
That's because I love you

227
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,087
and because this airplane
scares me too much.

228
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,390
I'd rather you were going on a camel.

229
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,155
This is a magnificent aircraft.

230
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:34,264
It is at least five years ahead
of its time.

231
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,471
An experimental design.

232
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,965
It's magnificent!

233
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:51,248
Everything's all right.

234
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,017
Hold on tight!

235
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,918
The sun's completely gone.

236
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,780
Her fat's in the fire now.

237
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,014
I don't know about that.

238
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:32,391
I don't think she'd have any trouble
handling that boy.

239
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,068
May I have the pleasure?

240
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,135
No, thank you.
I don't want to leave my husband alone.

241
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,733
But thank you for asking.

242
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,837
Dance with the gentleman.

243
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,314
You don't mind?

244
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:57,342
You know how much I like
to see my wife have a good time.

245
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,487
Go on. Hurry!

246
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:09,820
Tell me!

247
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,628
Cat! All right!

248
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:15,899
Well, we flew
over a billion miles of sand.

249
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,468
Remember, Cat,
how in the moving pictures

250
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,776
Valentino rode down the sand dunes
and swept the heroine off her feet?

251
00:17:58,848 --> 00:17:59,837
Yeah.

252
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,850
I asked my sheik
to do that to me.

253
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:05,785
Cat, you should've seen him.
It was so sad.

254
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:09,222
Every time he would try to be Valentino
and sweep me off my feet,

255
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,590
his horse would go the other way.

256
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,891
What happened?

257
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:18,100
- What's the matter?
- I hate horses.

258
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,795
But you can't hate horses.
You're a sheik!

259
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:24,033
I know I'm a sheik.

260
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,872
I had an English nanny.

261
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,912
He had an English nanny?

262
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,571
The nanny was all right.

263
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:33,877
I go to school at Oxford.

264
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,783
I've been here three times
my whole life.

265
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:39,821
I'm a poet.

266
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:43,115
Well, you're still a sheik.

267
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:47,959
The rest of my life is going to have
a very, very hard time keeping up with this.

268
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,529
Do you realize that no man on this earth

269
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:57,335
will ever again know the joy that you...

270
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,002
you will bring to me this night.

271
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,604
You are like the most precious flower.

272
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:09,716
And your blooming
can only be enjoyed once.

273
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:12,345
Just once.

274
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:13,684
His tent was a dream.

275
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:19,558
It was gigantic, filled with servants
and dancing girls.

276
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:20,960
And belly dancers.

277
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,295
They do incredible things
with their stomachs, Cat.

278
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,392
What? What do they do?

279
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:10,941
Fantastic!

280
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,605
What happened then?

281
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:15,651
Well, then he kissed me.

282
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:16,810
Why?

283
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:20,686
Cat, he lay me down so gently,
but positively.

284
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,724
I would have died.

285
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:33,496
And then...

286
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,435
...he undressed me.

287
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,530
What?

288
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:38,904
Everything?

289
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,341
I mean, everything?

290
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,672
Everything.

291
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:46,010
- Was everyone still there?
- No, no, no.

292
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,879
- No?
- He had them sent away.

293
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:19,674
Every time he went for the honey,

294
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:25,339
my stomach would sort of rise
to meet his lips.

295
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:42,096
Why would your stomach rise?

296
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:44,064
I guess it was inviting him.

297
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,395
To where, Mac?
To where?

298
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:48,266
- Catalina!
- Oh, there, of course.

299
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:49,463
Of course.

300
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:00,610
What?

301
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,047
- What?
- I've been lying.

302
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:07,453
Lying?!

303
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:09,982
Well...

304
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:14,557
I don't know, when we were, well...

305
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,464
When it should've happened...

306
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:41,551
No, Mac!

307
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:43,091
He went to sleep?

308
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,217
It's all right.

309
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:49,731
My ego tells me the sleep was
from the magic smoke, not me.

310
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,892
Oh, Rudy, Rudy.

311
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:55,270
Why are they all counterfeits?

312
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:57,436
Look at me.

313
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:01,139
I'm all dressed up
with no place to go.

314
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:08,113
Now, what do we do?

315
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:11,448
Well, we try again.

316
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,284
Mac, this place scares me.

317
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,450
Really, couldn't we go someplace
like Switzerland or Sweden?

318
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:21,325
Maybe Holland!
It's a nice place.

319
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:22,989
Holland? Cat!

320
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:27,161
It has to be warm and sultry and dark-eyed
when you give your virginity away.

321
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,999
Like Italy or Spain.

322
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,799
Italians scare me too much.

323
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:35,867
And Mac, I can't give my virginity
away in Spain.

324
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:38,175
I am eh-Spanish!

325
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,147
I know you are "eh-Spanish."

326
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:42,309
And you can't go to Barcelona.

327
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:45,983
So we won't even go near Barcelona.

328
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:53,286
Hey, toro!

329
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:54,659
¡Toro!

330
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,123
Hey, toro!

331
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:43,976
Matador!

332
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,343
You're a matador?

333
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,439
Too many seasons ago.

334
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,246
- It must've been magnificent.
- I had some afternoons.

335
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:24,218
Oh, my God!
What's he doing?

336
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:25,617
The horse could be killed!

337
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,246
This is a kind of festival.

338
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:29,757
You see the bull's horns?
They're capped.

339
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:32,885
But even in the big bull ring,
you never kill bulls.

340
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:37,365
Did you go Vigo? Used to fight
without the blood... nothing.

341
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,901
He is not so popular with the people.

342
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:41,903
I like a little bit of the blood.

343
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,531
Cotton, did you understand
what he said?

344
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,337
Yeah. He never the bull kills,
he never the blood sheds.

345
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,434
Therefore, he's not very popular
with the people.

346
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:50,740
Frankly, I think I'm going to enjoy it.

347
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:51,905
Look at that!

348
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:55,246
Cotton, does all this
make the ends of your boots curl up?

349
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:56,978
Tight as a drum!

350
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,214
¡Toro!

351
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:12,757
Hey, toro!

352
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,420
¡Toro!

353
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,490
¡Toro, toro!

354
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,753
Who's that?

355
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:47,157
She is his gypsy shadow.

356
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:51,029
- Cotton, did you...
- She's his gypsy shadow.

357
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:28,301
What's wrong?

358
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,804
I'm going to go see the duke
who is half-man half-horse.

359
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:32,602
- Where do I find him?
- In the chapel.

360
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:33,664
Okay.

361
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:35,642
See you later, everybody.

362
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,733
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

363
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:08,102
I just wanted to say
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

364
00:30:09,178 --> 00:30:10,202
Nor have I.

365
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:17,385
Do you think it's possible...
could I see your horses?

366
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,619
With pleasure.

367
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:30,724
You know horses.

368
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:34,197
I love them.
I was raised with them at school.

369
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:37,132
But ours were never like these.

370
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:40,334
Ours would run and jump
and chase a ball around the field,

371
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:42,104
but yours are magical.

372
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,474
They're like Pegasus.

373
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,103
Aren't you like Pegasus?

374
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,741
I would consider it an honor
if you would join me at dinner tonight.

375
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,078
Thank you.

376
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,817
But I have two friends.

377
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:58,723
Bring them.

378
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:01,353
Thank you.

379
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,961
You didn't have to invite them tonight.

380
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:11,062
These are private moments
for the family only.

381
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:15,566
It's bad enough that that gypsy child
is always with you.

382
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:18,135
We never have any time alone.

383
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:20,374
With you living in the country.

384
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,309
You never come to the city.

385
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:25,353
You hardly put a bite of food
in your mouth.

386
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,411
I didn't come here to eat.

387
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,683
That's too bad.

388
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:30,418
That was very fine chow.

389
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:37,493
He hasn't spoken to us all night.

390
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,796
Hardly even a look.

391
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:03,623
Did you enjoy the fight, Cotton?

392
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:07,528
He's sending you messages?

393
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:09,291
You noticed.

394
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,171
That's a pretty big message.

395
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,607
It feels like it.

396
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:32,148
It's nice, huh, Cat?

397
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,918
If that's what you want.

398
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:37,788
Come on, Cat.

399
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,555
Have some fun!

400
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,186
Send someone a message.

401
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:44,758
Who else is there?

402
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:46,990
Him.

403
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:52,700
Angel, Angel!
She looked at me.

404
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,376
Just practice on him.

405
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,438
Yeah! You're bad!

406
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:05,878
I could be if someone would
just give me the chance.

407
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,787
She knows a real man
when she sees one.

408
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:10,986
Now it's your table.

409
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,651
Take care of the women.

410
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,458
See Mama home.

411
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,589
You must come to see me more often.

412
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:19,861
I will, Mama.

413
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:46,718
Good night.

414
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:03,310
Mama.

415
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:14,988
Where is he go...
Where is he going?

416
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,888
I know where he goes.

417
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,392
I know you know.

418
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,020
That's why I'm asking.
Where?

419
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:23,223
Why you care where he goes?

420
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,232
I want to see him.

421
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,466
I don't think he wants.

422
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:31,631
What's your name?

423
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:33,732
Paloma.

424
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:38,004
Well, Paloma, do you think
we can do business with this?

425
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,044
The mirror is for me?

426
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:44,449
It is if you take me to him.

427
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,077
Do you accept?

428
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,854
It's too much.

429
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:50,721
For you, it's nothing.

430
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,294
No. For me, it is very beautiful
and very valuable.

431
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:57,896
For me, too.

432
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:00,230
- Good. Then it's done?
- Sure.

433
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:01,428
Okay.

434
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:04,097
Now, are we going to be welcome?

435
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:06,197
You are not welcome.

436
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:10,370
Because for a gypsy,
no stranger is welcome.

437
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:16,210
But you are with me,
so we'll be all right.

438
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:17,512
Okay.

439
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:18,575
Sorry.

440
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:20,587
I think.

441
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:41,970
I have the rich lady.

442
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:44,271
I have the rich lady.

443
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:46,439
Why do you bring her here?

444
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:48,483
She gave me this.

445
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,780
- What lady?
- The blond lady.

446
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:57,382
Angel and Raymond say she is
the most beautiful woman in all the world.

447
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:16,511
You want to go to the bed
with my man?

448
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:20,476
I don't think any of us wanna go
to bed with your man.

449
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,982
It's true?

450
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,413
Do I look so dishonest?

451
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:27,581
It's true?

452
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:30,816
I think your man is very beautiful.

453
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,758
You see good.

454
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:35,228
And do you want to take him
to your bed?

455
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,993
- I think...
- I think no.

456
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm the woman for his bed

457
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,899
and there will be no other.

458
00:36:42,437 --> 00:36:44,234
No other.

459
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,873
She is too mean.

460
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:52,709
Hey, how long has he been with her?

461
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:55,408
Since her 14 years birthday.

462
00:36:56,418 --> 00:36:57,783
It's me next.

463
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:01,881
Soon, he's going to take me.

464
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,357
He'll do what?

465
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:06,726
Take me.

466
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:08,592
I'll be his woman.

467
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,096
You'll be his what?

468
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:20,735
Woman.

469
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,700
Oh, damn.

470
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,041
Well, it looks like you're all out of luck.

471
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:30,141
The little firebrand is
taking her man to bed.

472
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:36,918
You know something?
I think it's time we all went beddy-bye.

473
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:39,423
Why he do that?

474
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:42,722
He do not even like her anymore.

475
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,166
Thank you, Paloma.

476
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:49,800
It's been a very interesting experience.

477
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,066
I hope your 14th birthday comes soon.

478
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,631
You do not want me to go
to the town with you?

479
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,974
Like Cotton said,
we are all going to bed.

480
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,877
And where are you gonna sleep?

481
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,885
Wherever they sleep,
I sleep on the floor.

482
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:06,215
You've got a deal.

483
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:07,880
Paloma! Let's get out of the tub.

484
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:13,290
No! I go stay in here forever!

485
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:16,826
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

486
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,763
What a mess!

487
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:22,331
Look at you.

488
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:24,429
What are we going to do today?

489
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:27,100
- Am I going to help you?
- Absolutely.

490
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:28,267
Here we go. Up.

491
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:29,674
No!

492
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:30,802
Stand up.

493
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:34,610
- What you going to do?
- I'm going to rinse you off.

494
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,708
- But why?
- So you don't itch.

495
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:39,219
- But...
- Look at you.

496
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:42,256
I am woman ready.

497
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:43,985
Juicy, too.

498
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:52,097
We are not up here
freezing our tiny titties off

499
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,136
because you just want
to buy a horse today!

500
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:56,397
We're not?

501
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,531
No, Miss McGillvary,
we are not!

502
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:05,069
You want this beautiful young duke
to quickly take your sweet virginity.

503
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:10,083
That's why we're freezing up here
in a dumb car that won't run!

504
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:13,245
I might kill two birds with one stone.

505
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:17,024
Don't you have to be
in love with him to do that?

506
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:19,492
I don't know.
I've never done it before.

507
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:28,134
Oh, my God.

508
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:39,336
All right. Very slowly,
everybody back to the car.

509
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:40,906
Okay.

510
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,882
He could break this car.

511
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:47,215
I'll... hit him between the eyes.

512
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:50,417
Cotton, that's a bull.

513
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:51,752
It's not a bull.

514
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:11,905
What are you doing way up here?

515
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,505
Paloma said you may be
in the mountains for a whole week.

516
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:15,571
I couldn't wait.

517
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,845
And you came all this way to see me?

518
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:21,355
She said some of your bulls had
run up into the mountains after cows,

519
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,721
and you had to get them
before they froze.

520
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,623
Was that one of the naughty boys?

521
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:29,255
He was.

522
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:31,288
Why did you want to see me?

523
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:33,527
I want to buy some of your horses.

524
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,592
I don't sell horses.

525
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:40,036
Not even young ones?

526
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:42,406
I sell wine and bulls.

527
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:44,808
I don't sell horses.
I'm sorry.

528
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,913
That seems so final.

529
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,107
I'm sorry.

530
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,014
I feel so badly.

531
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:54,288
I would like to offer you
the hospitality of my home,

532
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,950
but it's so far away
from this mountaintop.

533
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:00,893
Well, if you found
all of your wayward bulls,

534
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:03,624
maybe you could
ride back in the car with us.

535
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:05,757
That would be very nice of you.

536
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,030
It's our pleasure.

537
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:14,541
Rafael. Rafael.

538
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,407
What possible use can you have
for one of these horses?

539
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:20,877
Assuming you owned
one of my horses right now,

540
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,439
what would you do with it?

541
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:25,281
If I owned
one of your horses right now,

542
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:27,913
I'd tell him, "I am not your owner."

543
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:30,816
"I am your friend."

544
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:38,926
Gracias, Rafael.

545
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:46,002
These horses are nothing
without the bulls.

546
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:48,474
Can you really see yourself doing this?

547
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:49,976
Oh, I can.

548
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:52,638
But then some people think I'm crazy.

549
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:57,480
You're sure there's no amount of money
that can buy that horse?

550
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,110
No amount.

551
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:03,489
But isn't it said
that everything has its price?

552
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:06,391
My wine does, my horses don't.

553
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:10,191
Mac, that's a beautiful horse.

554
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:12,324
I know.
I want him.

555
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,867
Sure you do.

556
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:21,739
May I invite you to dinner tonight
and try and change your mind?

557
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,539
I would enjoy such a dinner,

558
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:27,206
but unfortunately,
I have plans that I cannot cancel.

559
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:29,515
What a shame.

560
00:42:29,584 --> 00:42:31,381
You're sure?

561
00:42:31,453 --> 00:42:33,444
Sadly, it's true.

562
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:37,483
What if I were to not talk
about horses, but wine?

563
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,556
Even more sadly.

564
00:42:42,197 --> 00:42:43,824
I surrender.

565
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:45,798
I've run out of what-ifs.

566
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:50,101
Well, if we ever get back to the hotel,

567
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:53,470
it looks like dinner
with the old gang tonight.

568
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:58,274
Cotton, I think I'm just going to
go to bed and lick my wounds.

569
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:00,177
McGillvary, you just lost the battle.

570
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:02,011
You didn't lose the war.

571
00:43:04,452 --> 00:43:08,013
Do you think Cotton believed
your little-wounded-lady story?

572
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:10,046
I think so.

573
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:12,183
It was partly true.

574
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:14,520
Why I can't come with you?

575
00:43:15,563 --> 00:43:18,999
Because an opium den
is not a place for little girls.

576
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:24,266
You can stay there and bath...
I mean, and swim in the tub.

577
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:26,705
I'm no little girl.

578
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:30,868
Mac, do you know
anything about opium?

579
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,845
Next to nothing.

580
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:35,678
Except that it sounds romantic.

581
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,380
Well, the textbook say
that opium has two faces.

582
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:43,015
First face, killer... in large amounts.

583
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:47,619
Second face, love potion...
in small amounts.

584
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:51,598
Well, then it seems
as long as we're going to use it,

585
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:55,466
it should be exclusively
in the romantic amounts.

586
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:05,007
Are you sure Angel's going to be
in this place tonight?

587
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,908
Sure he going to be.

588
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:10,348
If he not at Lady Woo-hoo's tonight,

589
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:17,722
I give you back... mirror and pearl.

590
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,356
Please?

591
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:20,860
All right.

592
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:23,796
I make exceptions
for you and your friend.

593
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:25,662
Thank you very much.

594
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,667
Do you know the poppy well?

595
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,635
Well, we're acquainted.

596
00:44:29,704 --> 00:44:31,228
May I offer to guide you?

597
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:33,069
If you would be so kind.

598
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:39,377
A love potion,
in small amounts.

599
00:44:40,415 --> 00:44:42,542
Are we really going to do this?

600
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:43,777
I am.

601
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:46,952
Well, I hope we have a good time.

602
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:49,888
Oh, shit. I can't.

603
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:05,200
It's so hot.

604
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:16,145
Can you feel yourself
going or gone?

605
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:18,515
Definitely.

606
00:45:19,687 --> 00:45:21,018
Can you?

607
00:45:23,157 --> 00:45:28,618
It's nice... feeling.

608
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,795
Nice?

609
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:37,601
Cat, it's more than nice.

610
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,401
I know.

611
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:52,076
The lady said, "Move slowly."

612
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:55,920
"Always slowly."

613
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,688
I think it's time we go find Angel.

614
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:32,453
Is something wrong?

615
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:34,993
No.

616
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:41,199
We were expecting Angel Sacristan.

617
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:43,032
I see.

618
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,833
If you wait a minute, please.

619
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:46,339
Of course.

620
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,335
We'll wait.

621
00:47:00,555 --> 00:47:03,046
It looks as though
our little gypsy was right.

622
00:47:05,293 --> 00:47:07,488
It seems he is here.

623
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:14,194
If he is, what are you going to do?

624
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:17,530
Lie down and say hi?

625
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:19,232
Hi.

626
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,836
I don't sell horses.

627
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,974
Only wine and bulls.

628
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:35,421
How many bottles of wine
would you said you had?

629
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,958
Maybe a million.

630
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:45,324
What? Nobody has
a million bottles of wine.

631
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,930
I wonder how long would take us
to count to a million bottles of wine.

632
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:55,731
About 100 rows, about 300 bottles.

633
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,679
I mean... We got...
I mean, there is no way.

634
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:03,507
Twenty...

635
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:05,449
Was I right?

636
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,446
One million? Two million?

637
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:09,956
Five million?

638
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:15,756
Angel, how much would it take
to buy everything you produce?

639
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:18,424
- Everything that I produce?
- Yes.

640
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:19,727
Do you know about wine?

641
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:22,065
Catalina's family has vineyards.

642
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,832
Nothing compared to this.

643
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:27,500
Look, Angel,
can you excuse us a minute?

644
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:28,667
Of course.

645
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:34,645
Mac, buy it.
You have too much money!

646
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:35,773
Buy it!

647
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:36,839
And I'll run it.

648
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:39,216
You know if I was a boy,
I was supposed to run ours.

649
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:40,652
Please do it,
and we'll divide up the profits, okay?

650
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:41,710
Okay!

651
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:46,123
I will accept whatever two
out of three local banks value my wine at.

652
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:47,491
Is that fair?

653
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:49,890
Fantastic!

654
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,761
But you must hurry
and close the deal with the bank

655
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,893
because they hold
the paper on the wine.

656
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,267
They are trying hard
to sell their position.

657
00:48:57,338 --> 00:48:59,568
Okay. Cotton and I
will leave immediately, okay?

658
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,006
Listen, call the bank
and tell them we are coming, okay?

659
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:04,237
Fantastic! Bye!

660
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:05,336
Fantastic!

661
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:10,540
Fantastic! God!

662
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:12,675
Well...

663
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:20,286
Now that that's behind us...

664
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:24,864
...why don't we talk
about that honey-colored horse?

665
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:30,128
I'm sorry, but I really don't sell horses.

666
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:34,502
Maybe the word "sell" is
where we're having our problem.

667
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:36,934
Maybe.

668
00:50:39,674 --> 00:50:41,369
It was wonderful!

669
00:50:42,076 --> 00:50:44,101
- Did you freeze?
- Didn't you?

670
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:46,373
I was warm as toast.

671
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:48,677
I think I'm intoxicated by your horse.

672
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:49,841
Your horse.

673
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,147
Of course. My horse.

674
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,450
I never dreamed there was
such a beautiful horse.

675
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:56,854
What am I smelling?

676
00:50:58,059 --> 00:50:59,083
Hot cinnamon wine.

677
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,525
Oh, I'd love some.

678
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,825
Didn't I smell something chocolaty...

679
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:07,025
They say you gave her
the golden horse!

680
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,432
Hardly...

681
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:09,901
I do not speak to you.

682
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:11,563
Natty, Miss McGillvary is my guest.

683
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,573
- Your guest.
- Good night, Natty!

684
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:14,938
You bitch!

685
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,237
- All right, that's enough.
- Bitch!

686
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,470
You American bitch!

687
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:19,376
You bitch!

688
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:30,652
Now I kill you.
I have to kill you.

689
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:32,693
No more, Natty!
No more!

690
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:35,720
You are going back to camp.

691
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,957
Love me tonight.

692
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:39,795
Stop it.

693
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,926
Please, stop it, Natty.

694
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,035
Now I kill you.
I have to kill you!

695
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,300
Natty, shut up!

696
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:47,432
You shut up!

697
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:51,606
I kill you for sure.

698
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,544
Then go get your knife.

699
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:06,525
Please, Natty, go home.

700
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,734
Hello.

701
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:24,608
I apologize.

702
00:52:26,747 --> 00:52:29,147
I think I've known her too long.

703
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:33,175
You've known her, I believe,
since her 14th birthday?

704
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,949
The gypsy world is very different.

705
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:43,227
Fourteen years is very different.

706
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,923
Does this interest you?

707
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:53,072
I'd be lying if I said it didn't.

708
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:58,671
Fine. Why don't we go
to a more comfortable room...

709
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,209
...enjoy some chocolate cake,

710
00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:03,375
and we can investigate the difference.

711
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:05,942
And then, as I told you,
he fell asleep.

712
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:09,945
So now you have the story
of my sheik.

713
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,750
Maybe you should have
come to Spain first.

714
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,056
Maybe I should have.

715
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,069
And now would you consider
giving this burden to me?

716
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:32,503
Would you be interested in taking it?

717
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,252
Please.

718
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,856
Rest.

719
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:51,061
And I'll join you here at sunrise.

720
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:05,138
Sunrise?

721
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,511
Now seems just perfect.

722
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:15,655
Fruit's about to fall from the tree.

723
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:20,825
That was beautiful.
Thank you.

724
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,554
I'll rest in here tonight.

725
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:27,692
Be sure to wake me exactly...
and I mean exactly...

726
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:29,759
half hour before the sun rises.

727
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:32,738
Well, tonight you make baby.

728
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:42,875
He's either very clever or very cruel...

729
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:46,584
...because I'm going mad with wonder.

730
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,818
It's time.

731
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:56,420
Oye, you awake?

732
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:09,342
What... what are you doing?

733
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,004
I thought you should be
as scared to death as I am.

734
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,915
You are a ghost who is afraid?

735
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,649
That's about to wet its pants.

736
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:28,153
I was so secure
when I came in here last night.

737
00:55:29,063 --> 00:55:31,156
But then, I was also as high as a kite.

738
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,327
What are you doing?

739
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:37,764
Angel, what are you doing?

740
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:40,037
Have you gone?

741
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:43,304
Are you still here?

742
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,074
Angel, are you still here?

743
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,277
I knew it!

744
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,045
I knew this sheet was a dumb idea.

745
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,710
I shouldn't have done...

746
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,545
Oh, my God!

747
00:55:56,957 --> 00:55:59,221
You're as naked
as the day you were born.

748
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:01,124
That's true.

749
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:05,996
But only because it's been found to be
the most practical way to make love.

750
00:56:06,734 --> 00:56:08,201
You're gonna kiss me?

751
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,762
I thought I was.

752
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,040
May I kiss you instead?

753
00:56:17,111 --> 00:56:19,045
Whatever you like.

754
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:20,444
Okay.

755
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:24,842
- Where would you like us to be?
- Oh, I don't know.

756
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,922
The bed!
The bed would be nice!

757
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:36,455
Is there anything I can do to help?

758
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:38,661
I don't know!

759
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:41,792
Yes.

760
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:43,731
Lie down, please?

761
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:45,932
Could you lie down, please?

762
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:48,031
I think that would make it even better.

763
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:55,181
I've always imagined
this would be a fabulous kiss.

764
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,012
Put your head down, please.

765
00:56:59,787 --> 00:57:01,584
And now close your eyes.

766
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,384
And keep them closed.

767
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:08,484
And remember, this is my kiss.
You do nothing.

768
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:33,850
Was my imagination lousy?

769
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:37,721
- Was it a blah kiss?
- It was a great kiss.

770
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,055
I'm sorry.
It was a blah kiss.

771
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,754
It was a fabulous kiss.

772
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,558
No. I'm sorry.

773
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:50,298
Angel... now...

774
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:52,461
right now...

775
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:58,672
will you show me everything?

776
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,411
Do everything to me?

777
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:10,285
Show me everything I can do to you?

778
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:19,890
Am I too greedy?

779
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:29,103
You must be greedy.

780
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,610
The bed is a selfish place.

781
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:35,815
In it, we seem to give
only so that we may receive.

782
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:40,410
Is there enough that I can give to you?

783
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:44,057
So that you can give ecstasy to me.

784
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:51,527
That we will have to look for together.

785
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,300
Do you mind, Marie?

786
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,111
Marie, do you mind?
Please?

787
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:13,312
Gracias.

788
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:28,961
Open.

789
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,838
No, please.

790
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:09,538
I'm sorry.

791
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,177
I'm not a virgin anymore.

792
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:23,792
Hola. ¿Hola?

793
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:28,068
Sí. Dígame.

794
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:29,335
Sí, un momento.

795
01:03:32,879 --> 01:03:34,972
The telephone!
He want you!

796
01:03:46,259 --> 01:03:47,817
Hola.
Catalina, ¿qué tal?

797
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:49,054
Hello.

798
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,090
Hello.

799
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:52,887
Gracias.

800
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:54,228
Do you like it?

801
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:57,702
I think he's the most beautiful thing
in the entire world.

802
01:03:58,305 --> 01:04:01,797
I have to go to the bank, sign papers.

803
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:06,606
I'll go with you.

804
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:09,105
You will not.

805
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:16,820
You will enjoy your horse
and when I return tonight...

806
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,121
...we will celebrate your horse

807
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:24,926
and the entering
the wine business and...

808
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:33,136
I see here that you are holding
several valuable items.

809
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:41,177
A 1924 Rolls motorcar
and some art.

810
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:43,978
Why don't we
take care of these as well?

811
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:14,814
There you are, gentlemen.

812
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,009
Here.

813
01:05:27,794 --> 01:05:30,763
We did it, Cotton!
We did it, Angel!

814
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:34,198
Angel... he go to your bed?

815
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:35,757
No.

816
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:38,097
I think he do.

817
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:39,570
No, Paloma.

818
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,436
I went to his bed.

819
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:43,539
All right, enough talk.

820
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,202
Out, out, out.
Come on.

821
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:51,811
- Bitch! Bitch!
- Oh, my God!

822
01:05:51,885 --> 01:05:53,648
You American bitch!

823
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:56,185
Bitch! Damn it!

824
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:58,918
- Let me go!
- I got her, I got her!

825
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:01,756
I kill you! I kill you!

826
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:05,797
Bitch! Unlock the door!

827
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:08,098
I kill you!

828
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:09,692
There.

829
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:11,293
Now what do we do with her?

830
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:12,463
Leave her there.

831
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:14,063
No like her anyway.

832
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:17,470
Hello?

833
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:22,144
Miss McGillvary!

834
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:25,013
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

835
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:27,576
Come out wherever you are!

836
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:50,867
Sorry.

837
01:06:51,511 --> 01:06:54,378
We are going to have to stop dancing
and get some rest.

838
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:59,514
Horses and bulls ship out tomorrow
and the following day, I fight.

839
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:01,076
- You do?
- Yes.

840
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:04,123
And from the looks of things,
your friend can't drive.

841
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:08,222
So everybody will stay here.

842
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:53,567
How awful for him!
No one comes to see him.

843
01:08:10,824 --> 01:08:14,021
- Can't they see the beauty in that?
- This is too different for them.

844
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,358
It is always the other way,
with the killing.

845
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:26,597
He should be in a big beautiful ring
with thousands of people cheering him on,

846
01:08:26,673 --> 01:08:30,302
not here with a few people
wondering what he is.

847
01:08:44,057 --> 01:08:47,288
They want the killing, Mac.
They want the blood.

848
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:04,540
Marie, go!

849
01:09:05,045 --> 01:09:06,569
Go, Marie!

850
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:10,476
Marie, please, shut up!

851
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,177
Go! Go!

852
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:15,719
How is the horse?
Is he hurt?

853
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:16,813
Fine, fine.

854
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,188
Are you sure?

855
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:20,886
Take Marie home.

856
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,291
Do what?
Do what?

857
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:24,421
The dog... Marie.
Take her home.

858
01:09:25,532 --> 01:09:27,159
I'm all right.

859
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:30,362
You're all right?
Really, you're all right?

860
01:09:30,437 --> 01:09:31,870
I'm fine.

861
01:09:33,907 --> 01:09:36,171
He's alive, and I just don't care.

862
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:42,670
Mac, I know I sound cruel,
but that's romantic gobbledygook.

863
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:44,373
It's not.

864
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:49,745
Mac, you don't care
if he can never make love to you again?

865
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,093
No, I don't care.

866
01:09:55,862 --> 01:10:01,528
Mac, one time in your life...
that's going to be it.

867
01:10:03,937 --> 01:10:05,598
Well, it looks like it may be.

868
01:10:05,672 --> 01:10:07,299
Jesus Christ.

869
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:11,208
This really stinks.

870
01:10:18,852 --> 01:10:20,114
It's all right.

871
01:10:20,186 --> 01:10:23,155
In a couple of weeks,
he'll be as good as new.

872
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:25,984
Not really.

873
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:34,131
All they said was
he most probably won't be able to.

874
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:36,032
Probably.

875
01:10:36,102 --> 01:10:38,434
That means there's a chance.

876
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:41,805
That's a pretty strong probably.

877
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:47,376
Okay, forget about how you feel
for a minute, okay?

878
01:10:47,447 --> 01:10:49,074
What about him?

879
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:53,079
Can you imagine what's going on
inside him right now?

880
01:10:53,153 --> 01:10:55,781
Jesus. Jesus.

881
01:10:56,422 --> 01:11:00,051
Cat, I'm just not gonna believe
what they say.

882
01:11:01,628 --> 01:11:03,357
Okay, tiger. Okay.

883
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:05,090
Hey, tiger.

884
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:07,466
I'm going to be one.

885
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:09,757
May I come in?

886
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:13,368
Do you have a minute?

887
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,671
I have a minute.

888
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:24,345
Now, pay attention and concentrate
on what I'm about to say.

889
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:28,411
- Are you concentrating?
- I'm trying.

890
01:11:28,488 --> 01:11:29,546
All right.

891
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:32,688
Now give me your hand.

892
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:44,994
Will you marry me?

893
01:11:49,242 --> 01:11:51,608
Pay attention!
I'm proposing.

894
01:11:52,645 --> 01:11:54,374
I will ask you again.

895
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:58,244
Will you marry me?

896
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:01,310
I would marry you in a minute!
In a second!

897
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:05,748
But as I'm sure you know,
I have no right to.

898
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:07,520
Not now.

899
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:11,726
- Because of...
- Yes! Because of!

900
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,461
All right. Okay.

901
01:12:18,504 --> 01:12:19,903
Consider this, then.

902
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,367
You teach me
everything you can do with these horses.

903
01:12:26,946 --> 01:12:32,111
And watch me and grow to love me
more and more each day.

904
01:12:34,787 --> 01:12:39,781
And then soon, the prediction
of the doomsday doctors is no longer true.

905
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:45,124
And then you can sweep me
into your arms and drag me to the altar.

906
01:12:47,066 --> 01:12:49,466
And then we can live happily ever after.

907
01:12:52,605 --> 01:12:54,470
Can't we make a deal to do this?

908
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:00,936
Some of it for sure.

909
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:04,075
I'll accept that for now.

910
01:13:09,188 --> 01:13:10,587
Do you like the outfit?

911
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:12,784
Don't answer that.

912
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:14,417
I love it.
I may never take it off.

913
01:13:15,528 --> 01:13:17,621
That thing is going to work.

914
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:21,161
I guarantee you this.

915
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:32,537
Hello?

916
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:35,140
Hello?

917
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,142
Excuse me.

918
01:13:39,085 --> 01:13:40,245
You calling me?

919
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,986
Miss McGillvary told me
I'd find Catalina Terry in the winery.

920
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:47,356
Are you she?

921
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:51,557
Yeah. That's me, that's me,
that's me, that's me, that's me.

922
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,622
That's me, that's me.
How do you do?

923
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:55,995
Sorry.

924
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:57,763
That's okay.

925
01:13:57,837 --> 01:13:59,304
Who are you?

926
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:00,862
Robert Stewart.

927
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,271
Pleased to meet you.

928
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:03,707
Nice to meet you.

929
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:06,404
I'm one of Miss McGillvary's solicitors.

930
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,175
- Attorney solicitor?
- Yes, she told me about you.

931
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:13,016
You're handsome.

932
01:14:13,086 --> 01:14:14,485
So handsome!

933
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:19,485
Are you going to help me
to make a big company out of this?

934
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:21,356
I shall try my best.

935
01:14:22,161 --> 01:14:23,992
What do you wear under that thing?

936
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:26,031
Everybody jokes about that.

937
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:30,429
To learn that,
you must get to know me much better.

938
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:31,629
What?

939
01:14:31,704 --> 01:14:33,934
To know me much better.

940
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:36,268
Do you like virgins?

941
01:14:36,342 --> 01:14:37,969
I don't understand.

942
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:39,272
Virgins.

943
01:14:39,345 --> 01:14:41,472
Do you like virgins?

944
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:42,775
Virgins?

945
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:44,282
Yes!

946
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,148
I'm afraid I'm not
a connoisseur of virgins.

947
01:14:48,187 --> 01:14:50,121
Are there connoisseurs of virgins?

948
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:51,884
How strange.

949
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:57,623
Why you won't tell me
what do you have under that skirt?

950
01:14:57,697 --> 01:14:59,289
What is under your skirt?

951
01:14:59,999 --> 01:15:04,402
Listen, if we are going to be friends,
you'll no more be calling this kilt a skirt.

952
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,562
Is that clear?

953
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:06,798
What?

954
01:15:06,873 --> 01:15:08,067
What? Tell me!

955
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,336
Don't call the kilt a skirt!

956
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,674
It isn't a skirt.
It's a kilt!

957
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:14,076
Is that clear?

958
01:15:14,147 --> 01:15:16,843
Yes, very clear.
Absolutely.

959
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:34,399
Eight days and that sulking, pouting
little boy stays in his room like Scrooge.

960
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:36,867
Put a thing so I can put a thing.

961
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:40,662
It's not easy.

962
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,469
Sure it's easy.

963
01:15:43,009 --> 01:15:44,374
Put this one.

964
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:47,506
Okay, let's see what you can do.

965
01:15:49,982 --> 01:15:51,882
Easy. I win.

966
01:15:54,353 --> 01:15:55,411
No?

967
01:15:55,488 --> 01:15:57,319
You win, yes.

968
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:01,987
And now I'm going
to go to bed and cry.

969
01:16:02,061 --> 01:16:03,585
Let's take a walk.

970
01:16:05,031 --> 01:16:06,328
Me, too.

971
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:07,991
I go to cry.

972
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,832
Cry Angel.

973
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:13,905
Every night.

974
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:16,631
Cry Angel.

975
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:20,403
No, really, Cotton.

976
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,641
I'd rather be in bed crying.

977
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:25,650
A very short walk.

978
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:27,876
Very, very short.

979
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,353
I know.

980
01:16:34,427 --> 01:16:38,955
But you may be wanting marriage
because of this, rather than in spite of it.

981
01:16:42,702 --> 01:16:45,500
That's part of what
I'm going to go cry about.

982
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:48,136
If you'll let me go to bed.

983
01:16:49,475 --> 01:16:53,707
As long as you understand,
then you're dismissed.

984
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:56,813
I love you, Cotton.

985
01:16:58,017 --> 01:16:59,279
Me, too.

986
01:17:03,589 --> 01:17:05,955
You were really a cowboy?

987
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:10,226
I was until I got so big,
the horses figured they oughta ride me.

988
01:17:11,864 --> 01:17:15,322
Did you kiss your horse
like in a moving picture?

989
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:18,495
I kissed them better than anybody.

990
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:26,039
I was a... a really good kisser.

991
01:17:42,862 --> 01:17:44,420
You wait.

992
01:18:33,112 --> 01:18:34,909
¿ Qué pasa, Paloma?

993
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:38,075
Help! Help!

994
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:11,581
Well?

995
01:19:11,651 --> 01:19:13,619
It must be her.
She's not in her room.

996
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:15,449
Evita, get the men!
Give them guns.

997
01:19:15,521 --> 01:19:16,954
Get the cars! Now!

998
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:19,457
Hurry! Now!

999
01:19:19,525 --> 01:19:21,356
Really? They stole her?

1000
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:30,501
There's no key.

1001
01:19:32,371 --> 01:19:33,963
The truck, the truck, the truck!

1002
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,166
Come on, Paloma!

1003
01:19:37,843 --> 01:19:38,832
Hurry!

1004
01:19:40,713 --> 01:19:42,510
¡Caramba!

1005
01:19:42,581 --> 01:19:44,310
Esperadme.
Esperadme.

1006
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,214
Come on.
What you waiting for?

1007
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:01,532
- ¿Dónde está Cotton?

1008
01:20:06,605 --> 01:20:09,096
They was stolen her
because she's so rich.

1009
01:20:09,175 --> 01:20:11,040
I hope so, Paloma.

1010
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,975
I hope that's all it is.

1011
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:17,682
Drive fast!

1012
01:20:26,759 --> 01:20:28,954
Why are you doing this to me?

1013
01:20:29,028 --> 01:20:32,327
If you still have your virginity, I want it.

1014
01:20:32,398 --> 01:20:34,730
I don't have it anymore!

1015
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,392
That's sad for me.

1016
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:37,800
But no matter.

1017
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:40,031
I want you to live with me forever.

1018
01:20:40,573 --> 01:20:41,733
And I take you now!

1019
01:20:41,807 --> 01:20:43,741
Like my father took my mother!

1020
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:00,720
Hold on, Mac!

1021
01:21:04,096 --> 01:21:05,256
Yes!

1022
01:21:10,302 --> 01:21:13,499
Yes, Cotton!
Thank you, thank you!

1023
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:52,937
You f...!

1024
01:21:57,249 --> 01:22:01,242
My sheik,
your thought is very beautiful.

1025
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:05,690
And I'm very flattered.

1026
01:22:05,758 --> 01:22:07,316
But I'm in love.

1027
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,090
Down there.
I'm in love!

1028
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:13,495
I'm sorry, but I do have my needs.

1029
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,098
It's a chauvinistic world!

1030
01:22:18,804 --> 01:22:20,465
What I do is correct.

1031
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:22,837
I know you have your needs.

1032
01:22:22,908 --> 01:22:24,432
We all do!

1033
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:29,742
But... I'm very flattered
that you consider me one of yours.

1034
01:22:30,382 --> 01:22:33,818
But I must be selfish
and think of myself first.

1035
01:22:37,223 --> 01:22:41,455
I say he was eh-stolen you
because you're so rich.

1036
01:22:41,527 --> 01:22:45,964
No. He "eh-stolen" me
because I so cute.

1037
01:22:49,702 --> 01:22:51,363
You know, Angel walk.

1038
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:57,735
¡Alta, Marie!

1039
01:23:00,246 --> 01:23:01,406
¡Alta, Marie!

1040
01:23:03,349 --> 01:23:05,476
You don't think
you should come out into the sun?

1041
01:23:05,551 --> 01:23:08,111
Maybe look around,
watch me ride?

1042
01:23:08,187 --> 01:23:11,179
You know, you're days and days behind
in your loving me.

1043
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:15,694
Thank you, but Marie and I
are learning new tricks.

1044
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:17,388
Hello, Marie.

1045
01:23:19,398 --> 01:23:20,626
As you wish.

1046
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:23,497
I brought you some more
sweet little companions.

1047
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:28,435
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!

1048
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:44,719
Did the lovebirds send you
my message?

1049
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:46,758
I've got your message.

1050
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:19,977
I did it!

1051
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:34,022
Today he let me hug him,
and he even hugged me back.

1052
01:25:36,001 --> 01:25:38,401
And now he's back in his room
like a hermit.

1053
01:25:40,105 --> 01:25:41,868
A hug beats a kick in the butt.

1054
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:45,939
And Rome wasn't built in a day, I know.

1055
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:48,104
Who said that?
I never said that.

1056
01:25:57,656 --> 01:26:00,454
You want I give you
some more hot chocolate?

1057
01:26:00,526 --> 01:26:02,118
Yes, please.

1058
01:26:04,196 --> 01:26:06,721
Put two spoons of patience
in hers, please?

1059
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:08,926
- Put what?
- Never mind.

1060
01:26:09,001 --> 01:26:11,094
Do you want I give you some, too?

1061
01:26:11,904 --> 01:26:14,702
Okay, good night, everybody.
I'm going to bed.

1062
01:26:15,941 --> 01:26:17,738
Why you go to bed so early?

1063
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,610
No, Paloma.
For me, it's very, very late.

1064
01:26:23,115 --> 01:26:24,309
Night.

1065
01:26:24,383 --> 01:26:25,611
Good night.

1066
01:26:26,518 --> 01:26:27,542
Good night.

1067
01:26:37,596 --> 01:26:40,429
Thank you for taking them off first.

1068
01:26:45,537 --> 01:26:48,802
For you, it is a pleasure, Catalina.

1069
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:50,671
Fantastic.

1070
01:26:52,778 --> 01:26:54,712
I can't believe we are doing this.

1071
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:58,447
I can't believe I am happy
we are doing this.

1072
01:27:01,019 --> 01:27:02,714
But to do it properly,

1073
01:27:02,788 --> 01:27:05,416
you're going to have
to take off your clothes.

1074
01:27:09,495 --> 01:27:15,195
Listen... why don't you do it for me?

1075
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:18,334
- Take your clothes off, you mean?
- Yes.

1076
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:31,306
I hope you think I am as beautiful
with my clothes off as I think you are.

1077
01:27:51,136 --> 01:27:52,831
This is unbelievable.

1078
01:27:55,073 --> 01:27:56,301
I love it.

1079
01:27:57,976 --> 01:27:59,637
And the hurt... I love the hurt.

1080
01:27:59,711 --> 01:28:01,508
- You do?
- Yeah.

1081
01:28:04,116 --> 01:28:05,913
Do you love me?

1082
01:28:07,786 --> 01:28:08,878
I do.

1083
01:28:08,954 --> 01:28:11,946
Right now, I really do love you.

1084
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:15,226
I know right now you love me.

1085
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:22,161
And listen, if I want... I want your love,
we better not stop doing this.

1086
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:27,365
That would be the most wonderful way
to spend forever.

1087
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:30,704
- I don't think I'm up to it.
- What?

1088
01:28:30,776 --> 01:28:34,007
But if we cannot, I could still love you.

1089
01:29:05,277 --> 01:29:07,507
You're a hard man to seduce.

1090
01:29:17,589 --> 01:29:24,518
Listen, Angel, we made a deal for over
300,000 bottles to the United States.

1091
01:29:25,397 --> 01:29:29,493
We ship them out next week...
I mean, next month.

1092
01:29:29,568 --> 01:29:31,001
Can you believe it?

1093
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:32,934
It's fantastic.

1094
01:29:37,743 --> 01:29:39,176
Listen, Catalina.

1095
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:42,771
I'm getting the feeling that you haven't
kept me here most of the day

1096
01:29:42,848 --> 01:29:45,646
just to show me your sales reports.

1097
01:29:47,152 --> 01:29:49,916
No, no.
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

1098
01:29:50,422 --> 01:29:54,791
Mac asked me to keep you away
from the ring for a while today,

1099
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:57,829
and I think I've done very well.

1100
01:29:58,397 --> 01:30:00,991
Why would she want me
away from the ring?

1101
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,779
Hey, toro!

1102
01:30:36,535 --> 01:30:37,661
Bravo!

1103
01:30:59,057 --> 01:31:01,582
Bravo! Bravo!

1104
01:32:01,887 --> 01:32:04,720
I've done this
to get your undivided attention,

1105
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:07,384
to tell you that I will see you at sunrise.

1106
01:32:18,336 --> 01:32:20,531
You do remember sunrise, don't you?

1107
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:28,312
This better work.

1108
01:32:29,448 --> 01:32:33,407
I sure wanna be the duchess of Piores.

1109
01:32:33,485 --> 01:32:37,546
I'm sorry, Paloma,
but if this works my way,

1110
01:32:37,622 --> 01:32:40,386
I promise I'll find you another.

1111
01:32:40,992 --> 01:32:42,653
I'll give him to you.

1112
01:32:44,262 --> 01:32:46,730
Tonight be good night.

1113
01:32:46,798 --> 01:32:50,165
Angel be a man for you.

1114
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:41,248
Happy sunrise.

1115
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:43,617
Mac, this is not going to work.

1116
01:33:43,688 --> 01:33:45,121
Hold it right there!
Hold it!

1117
01:33:47,425 --> 01:33:48,551
Damn.

1118
01:33:48,627 --> 01:33:50,094
Come on, Marie.
Out you go.

1119
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:51,423
He's mine now.
Come on.

1120
01:33:51,496 --> 01:33:52,793
Out you go.

1121
01:33:57,102 --> 01:33:58,569
Hats are bad luck on beds.

1122
01:33:58,637 --> 01:34:00,502
You oughta know better than that.

1123
01:34:01,473 --> 01:34:04,067
Did I ride the horse
marvelously today?

1124
01:34:04,142 --> 01:34:06,440
Even more marvelously than you?

1125
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:07,842
I did, didn't I?

1126
01:34:11,516 --> 01:34:13,108
All right, off the bed.

1127
01:34:13,184 --> 01:34:15,345
Come on.
Come on! Off the bed!

1128
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,547
- What are you doing?
- Off the bed!

1129
01:34:17,622 --> 01:34:19,089
What are you doing?

1130
01:34:23,628 --> 01:34:24,822
Come on.

1131
01:34:31,469 --> 01:34:33,494
That's not the way we did it last time.

1132
01:34:35,206 --> 01:34:37,197
But then I was a little girl.

1133
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:41,075
Now I'm a woman.

1134
01:34:42,914 --> 01:34:44,381
You want to taste my blood?

1135
01:34:55,961 --> 01:34:57,223
Damn you!

1136
01:34:58,763 --> 01:35:00,321
Don't do this to me.

1137
01:35:14,179 --> 01:35:18,013
Don't take it out on me just because
you got cute with the damn bull.

1138
01:35:30,195 --> 01:35:34,097
This is a very strange vigil
we all seem to have gathered for.

1139
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:36,662
What are we here to do?

1140
01:35:37,535 --> 01:35:39,332
We're here to help Angel and Mac.

1141
01:35:41,406 --> 01:35:43,271
We cannot help Angel.

1142
01:35:44,743 --> 01:35:46,802
Angel have to be a man.

1143
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,304
Is no problem.

1144
01:35:57,122 --> 01:35:59,716
You say that we never found ecstasy.

1145
01:36:00,992 --> 01:36:02,892
That it was like quicksilver,

1146
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:05,521
always promising next time.

1147
01:36:11,002 --> 01:36:13,266
I want ecstasy.

1148
01:36:14,506 --> 01:36:15,905
Let's find it.

1149
01:36:18,743 --> 01:36:20,472
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

1150
01:36:21,513 --> 01:36:23,538
Make me whole again!

1151
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:28,378
I guaranteed it!

1152
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:01,881
Fourteen.

1153
01:37:01,953 --> 01:37:03,614
Shame on you.

1154
01:37:04,989 --> 01:37:07,150
Was she as wild then?

1155
01:37:07,225 --> 01:37:09,090
Did she scratch you?

1156
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:12,459
Long wicked scratches?

1157
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:16,656
She did, didn't she?

1158
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:18,995
And you loved it.

1159
01:37:21,106 --> 01:37:24,735
I think this seems like a perfect time
to tell you that I love you.

1160
01:37:28,146 --> 01:37:31,604
And an equally perfect time for you
to tell me the same?

1161
01:37:32,217 --> 01:37:33,775
I do.

1162
01:37:33,852 --> 01:37:34,978
I'm sure.

1163
01:37:35,053 --> 01:37:37,521
Beyond your wildest dreams.

1164
01:37:38,656 --> 01:37:43,116
Well, my dreams take me
beyond infinity.

1165
01:37:44,596 --> 01:37:46,860
What love you must have for me.

1166
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:03,047
I guaranteed it.

1167
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:33,972
Bravo!

1168
01:38:34,045 --> 01:38:35,774
You... bravo.

1169
01:40:19,951 --> 01:40:21,179
Look.

1170
01:40:24,956 --> 01:40:27,117
"X." I was right.

1171
01:42:17,668 --> 01:42:20,728
Angel, my foot.
My foot is cramped.

1172
01:42:22,106 --> 01:42:24,074
Angel, give me back my foot, please.

1173
01:42:26,177 --> 01:42:27,576
Oh, God.

1174
01:42:27,645 --> 01:42:29,545
I'm sorry.

1175
01:42:29,614 --> 01:42:31,241
Thank you.
