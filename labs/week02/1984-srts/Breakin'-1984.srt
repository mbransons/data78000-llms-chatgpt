1
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,391
Come on, Kelly, let's go.

2
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,397
Let's get the hot food
out to the customers.

3
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,331
Who the hell
eats hot dog food, anyway?

4
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:13,733
What the--you stupid moron!

5
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,764
What the hell is wrong with you?

6
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,834
Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

7
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,971
What do you need--
a red light and a green light?

8
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,640
Come on.
Get this stuff cleared up.

9
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,012
Jeez, how many times...

10
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,540
Vicky! l don't believe it!

11
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:28,418
What are you doing here?
How have you been?

12
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,719
God, you look great.
Look at you.

13
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,590
Thanks. You know, the one good
thing about dancing in Vegas...

14
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,958
is it does keep you in shape.

15
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:37,759
-lt's been a while.
-Yeah, it has been a long time.

16
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,061
But l see you haven't
lost any of your moves.

17
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,692
l'm keeping in shape.

18
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,033
l figure l still have
a few good months left in me.

19
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,867
l am pushing 20, you know.

20
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,806
Have you thought
about a second career?

21
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,901
Never. l'll die on my toes.

22
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:53,936
Dancing or...working here?

23
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,208
Look, all l know is
you're slaving away...

24
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,811
in this grease trap,
and you're not dancing.

25
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:02,321
You know, l still have
Franco's classes...

26
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,617
and they're so important to me.

27
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,420
Are you still with Franco?

28
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,891
Yeah. He's the best.

29
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,986
At dancing, maybe. You forget
who you're talking to.

30
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:10,155
l know the routine.

31
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,187
lt's the same thing
with all the girls.

32
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,324
l don't want to get
heavy-handed...

33
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,333
but you be careful of him.

34
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,528
-Kelly!
-l have to go.

35
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,130
Listen, there's a friend
of mine--James Wilcox.

36
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,662
He's an agent here in L.A.

37
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,265
Give him a call.
He might be able to help.

38
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,333
Kelly!

39
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,576
Down here.

40
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,982
That's it. Now!

41
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:35,647
Down here. Come on, Kelly.
Come on. You're leading them.

42
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,522
Now, reach back. You're late.

43
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:41,493
That's it. Come on.
That's it. Turn. Reach.

44
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,689
Use the whole body.
Come on. Move across now.

45
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,028
Cross the floor. Back. Come on.

46
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,762
Up. Now, that's it.
Up, down. Hit the floor.

47
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,834
Back...and down.

48
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:54,840
Reach. That's it.

49
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,365
Pull back. Come on.
Come on, now.

50
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,645
Reach across. And hup 3, hup 5,
hup down, hup 2...

51
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,980
hup back!

52
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,243
That's it. Thank you.

53
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,306
-l'm serious.
-Just get out of here.

54
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,898
Come on. You promised.

55
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,034
l know.

56
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,509
You're looking better.

57
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:43,087
You still got to learn
to relax, though.

58
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,886
-l'll work at it.
-Loosen up.

59
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,717
Let the music caress you
when you move.

60
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:55,124
Look, l got a couple of minutes.
You want to stay and work?

61
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,534
-l'm sorry. l've got to go.
-Kelly...

62
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:01,640
l'm a very good teacher.

63
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:06,209
lf there's anybody who knows
what you need, it's me.

64
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,779
Nothing but the best
for the best, huh, baby?

65
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,046
l know someone
who'd argue that point.

66
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,901
Did mommy forget
to pick you up again?

67
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:31,403
Cute, Kelly. Some people
love you for your body.

68
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,963
Me, it's your charming wit.

69
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,373
So what did Our Almightiness
want this time?

70
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:39,071
lt wasn't my charming wit,
Cupcakes.

71
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,104
Do you want to go for a bite?

72
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:42,375
No. actually,
l was supposed to meet...

73
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:43,939
some dear,
close friends of mine...

74
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,416
but it's way out in Venice...

75
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:47,545
and l'd hate to take you
out of your way.

76
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:48,884
l'll ride the bus.

77
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,558
Well, at least let me drop
you off at the bus stop.

78
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,753
Really, Kelly, l think
you'd love to meet these guys.

79
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,159
They're terrific.

80
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,324
l guarantee you they won't want
you for your body or your wit.

81
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:00,627
That's a relief.

82
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,158
But l'd definitely keep
an eye on your purse.

83
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,864
Nice, Cupcakes. Nice.

84
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,997
You promised me
you wouldn't call me that.

85
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,167
l can't help it.
You're just so cute.

86
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,403
Would you stop?

87
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,972
There they are over there.

88
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,840
l tell you, Kelly,
you're really gonna love this.

89
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,607
Hurry up. l don't want
you to miss anything.

90
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,876
-Should l wear my coat?
-No. You don't need it.

91
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:51,741
Come on.

92
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,316
Come on. Up here.

93
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:26,212
-Ozone!
-Hey, Adam!

94
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:27,879
Hey, man, Adam!
What's happenin'?

95
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,185
Nothing much, man.
This is Kelly.

96
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,650
Hi.

97
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:39,829
Come on. Let's do some of
the stuff we do in class.

98
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,596
-Oh, no. You kidding?
-Come on. lt'll be fun.

99
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:45,103
-Not here.
-Come on!

100
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,710
Five, six, seven, eight.

101
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,047
Come on.

102
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,522
Watch him.

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,600
-l can't do that.
-Try. OK. All right!

104
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,836
Come on, Kelly. Get down.

105
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,749
Show us what you got.

106
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:33,775
-All right, Miss Bennett!
-Good!

107
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,660
Go turn 'em out, man.

108
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,201
Kelly.

109
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:07,711
Get 'em!

110
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,348
Come on.

111
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:26,336
-Let's go.
-Let's get out of here.

112
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,033
-Let's go get something to eat.
-OK.

113
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,406
Ozone, wait up.

114
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,535
What's up, dude?

115
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,169
Who was that guy?

116
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:34,236
That was nothing.

117
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,747
Hey, wasn't she hot?

118
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:37,545
Oh, God. l feel so silly.

119
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,279
No, you were good.
Hey, wasn't she hot, Turbo?

120
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,282
You guys weren't
so bad yourselves.

121
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,790
Oh, allow me. Kelly...

122
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,384
the mean machine right there--
that's Turbo.

123
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,123
Hi. What kind of names
are Ozone and Turbo?

124
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:52,131
The kind of names
that only a few people...

125
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,655
are allowed to call us by.

126
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,498
-They're our street names.
-All the dancers have them.

127
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,699
Really? Well, then why
do you get so upset...

128
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,264
when l call you Cupcakes?

129
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,537
Cupcakes!

130
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:08,671
All right, enough already.

131
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,275
Well, l've got to run.
l've got a lot of things to do.

132
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,807
Thanks for the dance.

133
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,412
Sure. Anytime.
Maybe we'll see you again, huh?

134
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,150
-Maybe.
-And who knows?

135
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,215
With a little work,
you'll be poppin' and lockin'...

136
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,316
and breakin' in no time.

137
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,260
You owe me one, Miss Bennett.

138
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,853
l'll see you later.

139
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,190
Special K!

140
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,757
What?

141
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,168
Special K. Any good dancer
has a street name.

142
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,238
Man, l should have got
her number. Look at her.

143
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,730
What are we doing here?
We're gonna see Adam tonight.

144
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,257
Do you think l'm here
to see Adam?

145
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,870
What, are you falling
in love again?

146
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,500
No, man. l just like the way
she dances, all right?

147
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,173
Girls!

148
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:22,979
Don't you worry. l got
the finest dancers available.

149
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:26,253
ln fact, l suspect it's not even
going to be a contest.

150
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,692
No, l...

151
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:32,220
l think that l can guarantee you
that we're going to win.

152
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,176
Well, this is a surprise.

153
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,684
Hi, Ozone. Hi, Turbo.

154
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,481
The name's Tony.

155
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,978
OK, Tony. l had
a great time yesterday.

156
00:12:58,024 --> 00:12:59,992
-Yeah?
-Yeah. lt was different.

157
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,624
Listen, l got
to get back to work.

158
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:05,756
You guys probably
ought to leave...

159
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:06,992
'cause if Franco comes
in here and sees you...

160
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,159
l'll get in a lot of trouble.

161
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,066
Hey, that dancing's fresh.

162
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,469
-lt's what?
-lt's bad!

163
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:17,502
Wait a minute, now.

164
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,687
Hey, Turbo!

165
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,212
Hey! What's up?

166
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,908
You want to waste your time,
do it someplace else...

167
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,468
but don't mess with mine.

168
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,509
-Who are you?
-The name's Tony.

169
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:32,916
Well, as long as
you're standing there...

170
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:35,887
you're wasting my time,
and my time ain't cheap...

171
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:38,584
so l suggest you clear out now.

172
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:40,319
lf you want to take my class...

173
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,088
your name goes
on a waiting list.

174
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,931
lf you want to talk to him,
you talk to me.

175
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,629
And who might you be?

176
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,403
Orlando--
choreographer...dancer.

177
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,074
So this bit
of amateur dancing...

178
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:02,308
that my class was
so privileged to witness...

179
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,781
was your conception.

180
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,715
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

181
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:07,878
Since we're all here...

182
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,785
why don't you show us
what you've got?

183
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:20,829
-You owe me $7.00, man.
-Yeah? What for?

184
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,027
For teaching you
how to dance, sucker.

185
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,767
Class dismissed.

186
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,613
Don't worry about it.
They ain't nothin'.

187
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,641
Do you know, if we put them
on the streets, we'd burn 'em.

188
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:45,348
l'm sorry about what happened.
l tried to get them to leave.

189
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,689
Why were they here?

190
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,490
l guess they came to see me.

191
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:52,361
-You know those guys?
-l just met them once.

192
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:54,956
Well, l'd keep it that way.

193
00:15:58,838 --> 00:15:59,896
Forget it.

194
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,742
You want to hear the music for
the show l'm choreographing?

195
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,577
-You got it!
-Yeah.

196
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:13,278
All right! Congratulations.
That's great.

197
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,879
You know, l may seem
tough sometimes...

198
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,821
but there's always a reason.

199
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,654
You know that, don't you?

200
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:20,920
Yeah, l know.

201
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,701
You know, those street kids
haven't got what it takes.

202
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:08,036
They're very talented. You
really should see them dance.

203
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,541
lt takes more than talent.

204
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,377
You got to be tough.

205
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:21,845
Now, you...

206
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,050
You've got the talent.

207
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,382
Head up.

208
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,964
Caress me. More passion.

209
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,436
Take the floor. Dance.
Dance...across the floor.

210
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,244
That's it. Now, jump.

211
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:26,046
Come on, fly.

212
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:27,552
Feel it! Up.

213
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,520
That's it. Now you got it.

214
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:32,190
All right, over here.

215
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,658
More emotion. To the mirror.

216
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,530
Feel it. All right,
now turn around.

217
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,293
That's it.

218
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,566
What are you doing?!

219
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,907
Franco, stop!

220
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,413
-Kelly, l just...
-Just get away from me!

221
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,750
Go to hell!

222
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,620
Goddamn it!

223
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,323
l'd like to thank you
for this award.

224
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,799
lt's the recognition
of my peers...

225
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:20,329
that makes all those agonizing
days of teaching Ozone...

226
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:21,964
everything l know that--

227
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,634
l don't want to stay here
all night. Do you?

228
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,879
Award winners don't push brooms.

229
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,041
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
go out and sweep, man?

230
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,950
Who do you think you are,
anyway--Fred Astaire?

231
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,112
Who?

232
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,849
Just go on and sweep,
knucklehead.

233
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,941
Hey, Turbo, did you
finish sweeping up?

234
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,111
-Yeah.
-You sure?

235
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,313
Yeah. You want to come
see for yourself?

236
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,686
All right, man.

237
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,994
Man, look at this stuff.

238
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:59,088
Look at that cup
right there, man.

239
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:01,759
Uh-oh. We've got company.

240
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,361
You guys are dirt, man.

241
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,995
We'll put you under.

242
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:08,268
Yeah. You're looking
at the piranha.

243
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,831
We're gonna eat you and...

244
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,309
spit out the pieces
we don't like.

245
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,209
Oh, yeah? Show me, man.

246
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,237
Come on, sucker, right now.

247
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,545
You want some?
Then come and get it.

248
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,745
Why don't you punks just split?

249
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,777
l think l hear
your mama calling you.

250
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,448
You don't like what you see?

251
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,583
Yeah, we're the dudes
gonna put you under.

252
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,525
Yeah. You're looking
at death, man.

253
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,028
You'll have to put a bag over
that face to hide the shame.

254
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:32,655
Anytime, man!

255
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,427
Friday night.

256
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,763
Be there...

257
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,359
unless you're chicken.

258
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:40,736
Hey, face, who are
you callin' chicken?

259
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,832
l won't blame you
if you don't show up...

260
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,605
'cause it's gonna be
real messy.

261
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:46,906
Oh, yeah...

262
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:49,505
and bring your girlfriend
the dancer...

263
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:51,675
'cause you're gonna need
a shoulder to cry on.

264
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,883
Come on.
Let's show those heifers.

265
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,721
Man, those dudes are whacked.

266
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,159
They don't deserve
the right to go against us.

267
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:07,063
But you heard them.
They called us chicken.

268
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,067
Well, those dudes will just
have to wait their turn...

269
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,432
now, won't they?

270
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:13,336
What about Friday?
We're not gonna back down.

271
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,233
Yeah, well, if those dudes
come Friday...

272
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:21,042
and they cross that line,
we're gonna cut 'em.

273
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:42,161
We're wasting our time, man,
on a bunch of nobodies.

274
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,465
You heard them.
They think they're so bad.

275
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,597
They're punks.
We don't got nothin' to prove.

276
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,199
Look, they put us down.
We can't go back on that.

277
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,073
Why not?

278
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,807
Man, everybody will bag
on us if we back down.

279
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:58,112
What are you worried about?
You're the best, right?

280
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:08,122
All right. Let's turn
these fools out, man.

281
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:18,025
Come on! Let's hit it.

282
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,587
Hi, Kelly.

283
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:43,220
Hi. Hope you didn't
come here to eat.

284
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:46,197
Oh, no way. l respect my body.

285
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,492
l've missed you in class lately.

286
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:53,198
Been busy. Has me working
double shifts now.

287
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,230
Franco's been acting a little
weird the last few days.

288
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,368
So what's so unusual about that?

289
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,239
-Well?
-Well, what?

290
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:06,115
Well, did anything
happen between you two?

291
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:08,915
No! l'm just ready for a change.

292
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,081
l feel my life getting stale.

293
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,956
Stale? Like that hamburger
if the customer doesn't get it.

294
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:19,453
Hey, Earring.
You gonna order something?

295
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:22,331
Yeah. l guess l'll have
the...Health Department.

296
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,562
My father just happens
to work for them.

297
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,834
This is the kind of place
that would make his mouth drool.

298
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,536
lf you want anything,
it's on the house.

299
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:34,307
Thanks.

300
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:37,509
God damn. The earring prince
here thinks he...

301
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,609
-Adam! l do have some good news.
-And what's that?

302
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:43,143
l'm going to see an agent
about some work.

303
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,418
Kelly, that's great!

304
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,687
Maybe some of these years of
training will start to pay off.

305
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,125
Well, Kelly,
these pictures are very good.

306
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:53,392
You're very photogenic.

307
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:55,525
You want to get serious
about your dancing?

308
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,365
-Have you danced professionally?
-Well, once.

309
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:01,133
Did you ever see the ''Dancing
Doggie'' dog food commercial?

310
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:04,574
Let's just say you have
no professional experience.

311
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,941
l think we should pursue...

312
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:08,708
the dance possibilities
here in town.

313
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:11,147
Allow me to set up
a few auditions.

314
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,549
You can make the rounds,
get your feet wet.

315
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,985
-What do you think?
-Sounds great to me.

316
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,121
OK, so l'll set up a few
appointments this week.

317
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:22,626
We'll see you later, OK?

318
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,360
Thank you, Miss Bennett.
You were excellent.

319
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,766
Unfortunately, the part
calls for a tall blonde.

320
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,402
Thank you. You were excellent.

321
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:16,004
Unfortunately,
we're looking for--

322
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:17,276
A short brunette.

323
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,714
This isn't worth it.

324
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,879
Blonde, brunette--
if they're looking for hair...

325
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,889
why don't they look at gorillas?

326
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,892
Don't let it get to you, Kelly.
There will be more auditions.

327
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:29,223
Not for this girl.

328
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:33,363
l just don't know if this is
what l really want to do.

329
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,763
You know what you need?

330
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,801
You need to live a little.
Relax.

331
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,835
l need longer legs, shorter
legs, punk hair, no hair...

332
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,433
l just need a whole new life.

333
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:48,537
Well, if you need a whole new
life, l know just the place.

334
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,844
-Where's that?
-The Radiotron.

335
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,214
lt's a place where street
dancers go to show their stuff.

336
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,481
Turbo and Ozone are
meeting me there tonight.

337
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,385
Ozone would love to see you.

338
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,049
After what happened
at Franco's class...

339
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:01,252
l'm the last person
he wants to see.

340
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,151
Now, that's not true.

341
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:08,731
-He asks about you all the time.
-Sure.

342
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:11,927
Hey! l could have used that.

343
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,029
Kelly, it was only
the first day.

344
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,267
There's nothing to be
discouraged about.

345
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,401
ln fact, there are plenty
of auditions coming up.

346
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,411
As a matter of fact, there's
something big developing...

347
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:21,969
in the dance community
right now...

348
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,777
and l'm trying to get the facts.

349
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:25,248
Sounds great.

350
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:29,276
Kelly, are you OK? l mean,
you sound really down to me.

351
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:30,879
No, l'm all right.

352
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:35,154
Well, are you eating? Let me
treat you to dinner tonight.

353
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:36,353
l already have plans.

354
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,556
l promised some friends
l'd go watch them dance.

355
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,929
Well, if you need
anything at all...

356
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,763
you just give me a call, OK?

357
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,234
l mean, that's what
l'm here for.

358
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,362
Thanks, James.
l really appreciate your help.

359
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:48,737
lt was my pleasure.
Have a good night, OK?

360
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,435
OK. Bye-bye.

361
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,504
Man!

362
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,492
You guys want us?

363
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,525
Then come and get us.

364
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,509
We wore them punks out!

365
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,915
We showed 'em.
We burned them dudes.

366
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:31,410
You're whacked, man. Fool!

367
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,651
What's the matter with you, man?

368
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:46,999
You know, there was something...

369
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:49,973
about the Radiotron
that was really different.

370
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:52,499
l mean, the people there
were real.

371
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,772
lt was alive, you know?

372
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,973
lt had an energy
that felt really good.

373
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,779
l was really surprised.

374
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:02,082
See? l told you
that's what you needed.

375
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:05,255
You were right...just this time.

376
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:13,361
Man, shut that thing off.

377
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:15,628
-What?
-Turn it off.

378
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:21,498
What's bugging you?

379
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,975
They beat us, man.
Don't you understand?

380
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,442
They just caught us off guard.

381
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:29,576
-So where am l going?
-Right over here.

382
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,609
What's she doing here?

383
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,443
Hey, man, help me
clean up this mess.

384
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,917
What's the big deal?
lt's only a girl.

385
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,425
Just do it.

386
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,721
Fine!

387
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:57,665
Hi!

388
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,978
We just thought we'd come by
to see how you guys were doing.

389
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,506
That's cool. We're just
working on some new moves.

390
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,519
You guys were really
great last night.

391
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:12,121
They were just watching
the girl, not the dancing.

392
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:13,784
lt was just a cheap shot.

393
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,521
l'd burn any girl that put
her face in front of me.

394
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,431
-She was good.
-l'm better.

395
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,731
Boy, do l have an idea!

396
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,532
We'll put together our own act.

397
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,699
What a team--the 3 of you,
and me as manager.

398
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:30,969
She ain't no street dancer.

399
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,806
She knows nothin'
about what we do.

400
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:34,277
She can learn.

401
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,940
Yeah? How?

402
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:38,949
You can teach me.

403
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,317
We're asking for trouble.

404
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:53,421
Man, now l know
we're in trouble.

405
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,717
Hey, let's go celebrate.
Lunch is on me.

406
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,244
No, l'll treat.

407
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,120
No, l want to treat.

408
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,523
No, l'll treat, OK?

409
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,931
All right. There you go.

410
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,159
Thank you.

411
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:53,428
l'd like to make a toast.
To the best.

412
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,405
To our friendship.

413
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:00,168
Are you a dancer?

414
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,974
Yeah. l'm one of
those guys that--

415
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:04,880
Dancer, my ass.
You look more like freaks to me.

416
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:07,817
Looks like their mama
never taught them how to dress.

417
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,979
Hey, don't listen to him.
Come on.

418
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:15,148
Yeah. Now, that's what
l call dancin' music.

419
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:17,218
Hey, why don't you come
over here and dance with us?

420
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,785
Yeah. Here's a quarter.

421
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:21,655
Oh, yeah?

422
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,702
You laughin' at me?

423
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,969
-Shut up, you little runt.
-Yo, man! What's up?

424
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:36,843
Are you lookin' for a fight?

425
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,017
l'm right behind you.

426
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,621
What about the check?

427
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,352
This is fun!
Let's go wreck another place.

428
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:05,968
Well, l can't say it was dull.

429
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:10,006
Well, l'll walk you
to your door.

430
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,408
Who is this from?

431
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,287
Hold onto it a minute.

432
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,927
-How sweet of him!
-Him?

433
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,599
Your boyfriend?

434
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,158
No, my agent--James.

435
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:32,794
He can do a lot for us,
you know?

436
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,868
Well, l was thinking...
that maybe...

437
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:41,811
See you tomorrow, OK?

438
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,040
Sure.

439
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,644
-Good night.
-Good night, Kelly.

440
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:05,030
-Street dancing?!
-James, you don't understand.

441
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,037
Kelly, l'm aware of what it is.

442
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:08,470
lt's just that l'm working
on getting you...

443
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:11,031
into one of the biggest
dance competitions...

444
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:12,975
which can lead
to incredible exposure...

445
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,502
and you're telling me
you want to be a street dancer.

446
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,242
Would you just let me
explain to you--

447
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:20,113
Kelly, you're wasting your time.

448
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:21,482
You've got to think
about your future.

449
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,282
We're building a career.

450
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:26,347
You can't make a living
dancing in the street.

451
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,382
l never thought you would
be so narrow-minded.

452
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,985
Kelly, l'm not.

453
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:34,020
lt's just that
you've got to be serious.

454
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:36,499
Street dancing belongs
on the street.

455
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:40,193
lt won't get you to Broadway.

456
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,900
Well, we won't know that
until we give it a shot.

457
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,601
Kelly, l hate
to tell you this...

458
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,371
Why not?

459
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,537
You know why everybody's afraid?

460
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,139
lt's because
they don't understand it.

461
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:54,913
lt's not just kids dancing
on a street corner for a nickel.

462
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,318
They put more heart
and soul into their work...

463
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:59,482
than any dancer l know.

464
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:03,385
James, it's real. lt's fresh.

465
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:04,985
All l'm saying is--

466
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,395
James, just get us
into the contest...

467
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,365
and l guarantee you we'll win.

468
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,561
All right, now, let me
get this straight. Humor me.

469
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:15,934
You want me to put
you and your...

470
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:18,737
street-dancing friends
on the same stage...

471
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:22,007
as trained,
professional dancers?

472
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,105
Well, come see
for yourself, then.

473
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:26,116
We're going against
Electro Rock tonight.

474
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,243
Electro...what?

00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:31,881
Electro Rock.
We got a score to settle.

476
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:34,619
This time,
we're gonna cut 'em bad.

477
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:39,062
You're...really talking
like a street person.

478
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:42,429
-You packing a blade?
-Yeah.

480
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:13,596
Where the hell is she?

481
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:15,690
Don't worry about it, man.
She'll be here.

482
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,029
Hey, punk.

483
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:20,799
Hey, are you back
for more, fool?

484
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,772
Yeah, and wearing
rags like that...

485
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,434
l hope you'll be able
to back it up.

486
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:26,876
Yeah, and you know it.

487
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,706
Kelly, l...

488
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:31,146
Maybe you're
a little overdressed.

489
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,843
Don't worry about it. Come on.

490
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,528
James, l'd like you
to meet my friends.

491
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,435
-This is Adam.
-Hello, Adam.

-And this is Ozone.
-Hi, Ozone.

495
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,850
James came to watch us dance.

496
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,946
l don't dance for
anybody but myself.

497
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:13,616
Oh, yeah, punk?

00:45:18,396 --> 00:45:19,556
Now.

501
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:21,326
Be cool, all right?

502
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:23,595
You bad? You want some of this?

503
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:28,737
You know, you do what you want,
man, but don't touch me.

504
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,468
You must be feeling
lucky tonight.

505
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:35,642
Now.

506
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,341
Don't worry about it. Just go
over there and watch us dance.

507
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,713
Kelly...

508
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,682
Go, girl! Go! Do it!

509
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,984
Why don't you go
keep James company?

510
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,714
All right. Go work 'em, Kelly!

511
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:40,957
Right on.

512
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,634
Oh, wow! What is this?

513
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:52,841
That's the girl from the beach.

514
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:18,995
That's good.

515
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,737
Kelly!

516
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:07,273
Man, you were great.

517
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:10,075
l couldn't believe it.

518
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,112
Unbelievable. You guys,
l want to tell you...

519
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:15,148
Amazing. Just fantastic.

520
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,216
Turbo.

521
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,987
Yeah, you got to teach me
that sometime.

522
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:25,195
Ozone, the way you dance is...
it's incredible.

523
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:26,327
Thanks, man.

524
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:30,473
lt was great meeting you all.
All right? Thank you.

525
00:50:30,507 --> 00:50:34,307
Kelly...you were...
you were right.

526
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:36,074
lt was just phenomenal.

527
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:38,638
-Well, l'm glad you liked it.
-l did.

528
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,745
Hey, listen, if you want
to spend time with them...

529
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:45,550
then l totally understand.

530
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:50,221
No, it's OK.
l just need to talk to them.

531
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,557
All right.

532
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:53,062
Hey, let's go celebrate.

533
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:58,163
Listen, l would really love to,
but l really got to go.

534
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:01,797
-You're not gonna stay with us?
-Well, l came with James, so...

535
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,873
We did really great tonight,
you guys! That was fun!

536
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:09,037
See you tomorrow.

537
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,000
-Yeah?
-lt's me.

538
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:34,367
The door is open.

539
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:38,868
How you doing?

540
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:40,103
l'm all right.

541
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:42,374
We sure tore the place up
last night, didn't we?

542
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:43,607
We did OK.

543
00:51:44,782 --> 00:51:46,682
James thinks we really
have something.

544
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:49,345
He says that we have one of
the hottest acts around.

545
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:52,116
-Oh, did he, now?
-Yeah. That's why l dropped by.

546
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:53,885
He told me about
this big dance contest...

547
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:56,085
and there's gonna be judges
from all over the country there.

548
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,457
lt's really big!

549
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,189
Are you kidding?
Those dudes don't want...

550
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,629
to have nothin'
to do with our kind.

551
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,963
What do you mean? We're good.
That's all that counts.

552
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:06,629
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know what l think?

553
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,161
l think we'll be
wasting our time.

554
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,265
Those dudes don't want
to give us the chance.

555
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:13,105
Actually, he's working
on it right now.

556
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:15,168
He's got some really
great connections...

557
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:17,146
and he can get us the chance.

558
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:20,412
He's really a nice guy,
and he's trying to help us out.

559
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:24,547
l've never needed anybody,
and l don't need them now.

560
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:28,354
lf those dudes want to see us
dance, have them come down here.

561
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:31,759
Or maybe they're afraid
of getting raped or mugged.

562
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:33,490
l really don't understand you.

563
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,124
l mean, this could be
a really big break for us.

564
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,463
Who knows what it could lead to?

565
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:38,798
l don't care!

566
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:44,005
l have everything
l want right here.

567
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,168
But if that's what you want,
Kelly, then you do it.

568
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,575
Nobody's stopping you.

569
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:50,506
Yeah, but...

570
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,215
Well, James has invited
everybody over.

571
00:52:56,253 --> 00:52:57,447
He's gonna have
this little party...

572
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,285
and you guys are
supposed to be there.

573
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,493

575
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:24,313

00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,453
Nice to see you.

580
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:44,062
Will you excuse me?

581
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:45,625
Hello. How are you?

582
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,500
Kelly! You made it.

583
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:49,438
-Hi, James.
-Hello.

584
00:53:49,473 --> 00:53:51,407

This is really nice.

586
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,508
Where's Ozone and Turbo?
Are they coming?

587
00:53:56,914 --> 00:53:58,211
They had some
other commitments...

588
00:53:58,248 --> 00:53:59,943
but they're going
to try and make it later.

589
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:03,475
Good. Good, because l've got so
many people l want you to meet.

590
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,886

591
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,117

00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:08,749
-You got to meet these people.

593
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,420

Sick, man! Sick!

Ah, yes. l'm one of
those guys that...

613

He's one of those young men
that spins around on his head.

614
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:50,682
Would you like
some of this pig cheese?

615
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:52,354
No, thank you.

616
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:53,761
Excuse us, Sofie.

617
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,230
There's someone else
l want you to meet.

618
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:58,428
Could be our major
competition in the contest.

619
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:00,368
-Excuse us.
-See you later.

620
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:04,440
l'd like to see you dance
professionally sometime.

You two know each other?

-Did he take your class, too?

633
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:44,574
Well, these amateurs

634
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:46,775
-On the same stage with me?
-That's right.

635
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,045
James, l thought
you were a smart man.

636
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:54,148
Now, don't jump to conclusions.
l've seen them dance.

637
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:57,354
Yeah, in the ghetto, maybe.
But in the real dance world...

638
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:59,191
against a disciplined
art form...

639
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:01,094
they're going to make
fools of themselves.

640
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:02,689
You callin' me a fool, man?

641
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:05,258
Look around you.
lt's pretty obvious, isn't it?

642
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,539
-Hey, come on.
-Get him off!

643
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:11,473
l told you he belonged
on the streets!

644
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:22,643
What is the matter with you?

645
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:25,745
Happy now?

646
00:57:27,657 --> 00:57:28,988
Come on, man. Let's go.

647
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:32,027
What do you mean, go?

648
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:34,656
That lady and l were working
on a 3-picture deal.

649
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:36,563
Come on, man!

650
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,534
-Remember...
-Lunch!

651
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:40,661
-Excuse me!
-Ozone, wait. Stop.

652
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:43,229
Please don't go.
Franco--he's just sick.

653
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:44,672
Well, l think you have
everything you want...

654
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:45,834
right here, baby.

655
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:46,934
Let's go.

656
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,172
Ozone!

657
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:54,114
lt's all her fault.

658
00:57:56,686 --> 00:57:58,085
Told you she'd be trouble.

659
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,752
You had no right
to talk to him that way.

660
00:58:05,796 --> 00:58:09,027
Just telling it like it is.
Face it, Kelly.

661
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,057
They're a different class
of people. They don't fit.

662
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:14,502
You know, Franco,
you're a really poor excuse...

663
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:15,903
for a human being.

664
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,601
You say they're
in a different class?

665
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:20,109
Well, you're right. They are.

666
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:21,770
They're in a class
all by themselves.

667
00:58:21,812 --> 00:58:22,972
They're the best
at what they do...

668
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:25,208
and not you or anybody
is gonna take that away.

669
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:29,116
You know it's really sad?
With me, you had a chance.

670
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:31,586
But now l can see you ain't
gonna amount to nothin'.

671
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:34,385
And what makes you so special?

672
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:35,652
Well, unfortunately, Kelly...

673
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:37,159
you missed your chance
to find that out.

674
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:40,255
Thank god.

675
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,293
Yeah. Well...

676
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,666
l think you better leave.

677
00:58:48,672 --> 00:58:50,902
l didn't have any intentions
of hanging around.

678
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,372
All right. We're gonna lock.

679
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:04,319
Now, when we lock,
roll our wrists...point. OK?

680
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:07,278
Go.

681
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:15,455
Now, we're gonna roll
our wrists, point, lock...

682
00:59:15,498 --> 00:59:17,159
kick out, jump up...

683
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:28,576
Baby Legs, come on.

684
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:33,743
Do the wave. Let's see it.

685
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:39,383
All right!

686
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:41,651
Break, hot tot.

687
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,194
He's sharp.

688
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:54,636
Soda Pop.

689
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:58,801
Footwork.

690
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:01,970
Let's see you spin.

691
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:05,671
There it is.

692
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:09,718
Come on, Ram.

693
01:00:11,154 --> 01:00:13,122
You guys are doing good--
real good.

694
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,386
She has a fast spin.

695
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:17,885
Pose.

696
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:23,390
Hi, Turbo.

697
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:27,530
You better be careful.
They might beat you someday.

698
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:30,205
l hope they do.

699
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,640
ls Ozone inside?

700
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:34,166
No.

701
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,507
Do you know where he is?

702
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,748
l haven't seen him
for a couple days.

703
01:00:38,782 --> 01:00:41,580
Well...you better not
let him catch you.

704
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:44,246
where could he be?

705
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,052
Venice, maybe. l don't know.

706
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:53,858
-Kelly.
-Yeah, Turbo?

707
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:01,363
Can't you see what's going on?

708
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:26,517
Hi.

709
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:31,459
-What do you want?
-l want to talk to you.

710
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:35,097
l don't think we have
anything to talk about.

711
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,636
-What's wrong?
-l don't want to talk about it.

712
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:46,208
lf it's what happened at
James' party, Franco's a moron.

713
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,183
l know how you feel.

714
01:01:48,218 --> 01:01:50,652
You don't know how l feel.

715
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:52,621
You don't know nothin' about me.

716
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:55,453
And your friends are
all phonies, man.

717
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:56,891
They're just like you--

718
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:59,793
up there in your tights,
being told what to do.

719
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:02,320
We don't care if we don't
step on our right foot.

720
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,691
We do what feels good.

721
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,895
And we don't do it
in the classrooms, either.

722
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,496
We do it on the streets.

723
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,973
So you're just gonna
throw the whole contest...

724
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:13,635
out the window, huh?

725
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:16,008
You're not even gonna
give yourself a chance?

726
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:18,139
We don't need it like you do.

727
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:20,308
They'll put us on the stage
and laugh at us...

728
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,284
because we don't
fit into your world...

729
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,310
because we don't have
the right credentials.

730
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:27,880
You know what your problem is?

731
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:30,085
Your problem is you.

732
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,525
You're a quitter!

733
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,688
You think you know it all,
Miss Perfect.

734
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,891
Well, you don't know
how l feel...

735
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:39,458
or why l do what l do.

736
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:42,164
Would you just stop
holding back?

737
01:02:42,205 --> 01:02:44,173
l mean, you're always
putting up fronts.

738
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,902
''Nothing bothers Ozone.

739
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:47,705
''Everybody always
looks up to Ozone.

740
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:49,041
He knows everything.''

741
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:51,843
God forbid he has
no doubts or fears.

742
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:56,875
What are you afraid of?

743
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,913
Well, maybe l don't know
everything...

744
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:02,754
like your boyfriend James.

745
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:04,953
Would you get off it?
James is not my boyfriend.

746
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:07,394
He's my agent, and he's
just trying to help us.

747
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,523
James is just a friend.

748
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:11,158
l mean, he really
believes in us.

749
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,567
That's why he got us
the studio to rehearse in.

750
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:16,829
Come on. l want
to show you something.

751
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:21,706
l want you to see what
real dancing's all about.

752
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,003
Look at him.

753
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,450
You see his face?

754
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,018
That's dancing, Kelly.

755
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,425
Well, this is it.

756
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,018
What do you think?

757
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:20,086
lt's wonderful.

758
01:05:21,164 --> 01:05:22,153
Thanks.

759
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:26,359
God, it's so nice to be
in a real studio again.

760
01:05:26,402 --> 01:05:27,926
l'm really glad you like it.

761
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,598
You know l'd do
anything for you.

762
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,735
For us, you mean.

763
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:35,938
Well, yes, of course.
For everybody.

764
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:37,344
Am l missing something?

765
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:40,974
Yes. Music. Let's get to work.

766
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:44,810
You guys can't let me down now.

767
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:47,186
l'm going to call all
my friends in the business...

768
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:48,815
and get you in that audition.

769
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,389
And you better be good.

770
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:52,374
Believe me, Kelly, l've called
every S.O.B. in the business...

771
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:54,103
and it's always the same answer.

772
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,043
''Forget it, James.''

773
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:59,639
This audition is for the biggest
dance production in years...

774
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:02,150
and there's no way
they'll even consider you guys.

775
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:05,086
lt just seems that Franco has
a lot more pull than l thought.

776
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:08,386
But we can't give up now. We
can't let Franco off that easy.

777
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:10,722
l don't know what else l can do.

778
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,853
Ozone and Turbo will go nuts
if they find out.

779
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:14,624
We can't tell them about this.

780
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:16,564
Kelly, we have to be
reasonable about this.

781
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:18,226
l don't want to be reasonable.

782
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:19,495
l've been reasonable
all my life...

783
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,435
and it's gotten me nowhere.

784
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,302
l am finally happy
and l have some real friends.

785
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,204
l'm not going to let them down.

786
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:31,809
Those phony, narrow-minded
stuffed shirts...

787
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:34,214
won't consider it dance
because it's not traditional.

788
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,842
What do they want?

789
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:37,876
l'll tell you what
they don't want.

790
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,617
They don't want kids
in T-shirts that are torn...

791
01:09:41,657 --> 01:09:45,354
and bandanas
and spiked bracelets.

792
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:47,928
Unless...

793
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:51,391
What?

794
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:56,872
No. Ozone will never go for it.
He's got too much pride.

795
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,931
Kelly, it's the only way
it will work.

796
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:24,325
Yes, this is my group--
the Allegro Vivace Dance Trio.

797
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:25,732
Good luck.

798
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,998
Gracie. Avanti.

799
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,051
All right. This is it.

800
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:45,676
We're on after the next group.

801
01:10:47,056 --> 01:10:48,284
You guys ready?

802
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:51,050
As ready as we're
ever going to be.

803
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:10,209
Well done.

804
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,990
What the hell
are you doing here?

805
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:28,690
You surprised to see the fools?
We're here.

806
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:56,381
-We seem to have a problem here.
-l'll take care of it.

807
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:03,997
l'm the manager of this group.
What seems to be the problem?

808
01:12:04,033 --> 01:12:07,059
l'm very much afraid they won't
be able to dance for us.

809
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:08,434
And why not?

810
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:10,132
Because l don't
think they'll fit in...

811
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:12,003
to our particular production.

812
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:14,601
What? How can you say that?

813
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,771
You haven't even
seen them perform.

814
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:18,803
Look, l'm sorry,
but we're looking...

815
01:12:18,848 --> 01:12:21,009
for some very good
jazz dancers...

816
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,608
and it's been made
very clear to me...

817
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:25,951
that those people don't fit in
to that particular category.

818
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:28,752
Look, they're here.
Just let them dance.

819
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:32,124
Look, l'm sorry. l'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

820
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:38,089
Well, it's your loss.

821
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:42,570
l don't know what to do
with these people.

822
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:49,835
l'm sorry. lt's not going to
work out. This is Franco's show.

823
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:51,779
They're not going
to stop us now.

824
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:52,906
Who's next?

825
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:54,245
Ozone.

826
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:57,751
Street dancer!

827
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,564
Look, l'm not going
to stand for this!

828
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:18,835
You must stop immediately!

829
01:13:22,578 --> 01:13:24,068
Now, listen here, young man.

830
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:27,310
Did you hear me?
You must leave now!

831
01:13:29,351 --> 01:13:31,649
Look, l'm not going to stand
for this. You must stop.

832
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,513
Stop right this minute!

833
01:13:35,558 --> 01:13:39,517
We are auditioning
jazz dancers only.

834
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:42,827
Stop this nonsense! Jim!

835
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,631
Oh...God. There's more of them.

836
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:49,763
Jim!

837
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,605
Jim, get them out of here
this instant.

838
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:55,735
Wait.

839
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,034
Maybe...

840
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:38,951
-All right, stop this nonsense.
-Go away.

841
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:41,554
Look, l'll pull my dancers out
if this doesn't stop...

842
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,557
and l mean it.

843
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:45,185
Let's talk about it later.
l can't see.

844
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:48,527
All right.
All right, that's it.

845
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:50,259
We had a deal, Mary. Remember?

846
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,893
You asked for it. l am out!

847
01:18:39,161 --> 01:18:41,925
Man, that girl can fly.

848
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:39,273
You've got the talent.

849
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:43,049
She ain't no street dancer.

850
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:21,654
-You're lookin' at death, man.
-Come on, sucker, right now.

851
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:26,820
-She was good.
-l'm better.

852
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:33,391
Who do you think you are,
anyway--Fred Astaire?

853
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,096
Who?
