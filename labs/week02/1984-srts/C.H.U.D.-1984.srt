'However, if you'd like
to leave one, wait for the beep.'

5
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,226
George, this is Derek.

6
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,684
Hi, Derek.

7
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,726
'Look, George, I know you're there.
You're just not answering the phone.'

8
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,267
You're smart, Derek.

9
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:54,559
'George, this is really important
so I'm asking you as a personal favor,

10
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,601
'please, just pick up the phone
and talk to me, okay?'

11
00:03:57,685 --> 00:04:00,101
Okay, Derek.

12
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,601
- 'All right, George, listen.'
- All right, Derek.

13
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:04,476
'Our deadline on the follow-up
article this Friday. That's tomorrow.

Have you found her brother?

what they are. What do you say?'

21
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,851
All right, Derek,
you made your point.

22
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,351
Hey, George?

23
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:35,392
- Yes?
- Who was that?

24
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:37,934
Uh, that was a wrong number.

25
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,059
Wrong number left a message?

26
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,892
You'd better start getting ready.

27
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,851
Ready for what?

28
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,267
For what?
We have a photo session.

29
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,351
What photo session?

30
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:54,184
Wait a minute. You are talking about
a photo session that I have today?

31
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,934
This is today we're talking about, with
the client, Tony and everybody there?

32
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:00,351
- What are you doing?
- I have a pimple.

33
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,976
Why are you putting makeup
on your ass?

34
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,392
'Cause it's where the pimple is.

35
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,267
And what are we shooting,
a centerfold?

36
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,851
It's a perfume ad, remember?

37
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,476
And what are you wearing
in this perfume ad?

38
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,601
- Perfume.
- Whoa! That's it?

39
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,017
- That's all you're wearing?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:19,934
Great.

41
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:23,642
I don't ever remember agreeing to this.
You know what I'm saying?

42
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,642
This is some more
of that plastic fashion crap

43
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,559
that I told you
I didn't want to do anymore?

44
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,601
Was I drunk?

45
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,434
Were we making love?

46
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:35,351
Come on,
let's forget about this

47
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,267
and stay here and,
you know, make stuff up.

48
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:43,101
It's at 10:00.
Alderson Studios.

49
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,767
We're booked. You're shooting.

50
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,101
Come on, don't make me do this.
I've been up all night.

51
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:52,267
You know which box
my jewelry case is in?

52
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,101
It's still down in the basement.

53
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:59,226
Wait, wait. You brought up
all your camera stuff

54
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,351
and left my things in the basement?
My... My jewelry?

55
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,392
Don't you think
you better get it?

56
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,767
Hello?

57
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:09,934
Oh.

58
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:12,392
Hi, Derek, it's good
to hear your voice.

59
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,059
- Hi!
- Hi.

60
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,809
Are you the people
who are subletting Morton's studio?

61
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:29,101
- Yeah.
- Uh, to live in?

62
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,559
Yeah, we're improvising.

63
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,601
Well, if you need anything,
I'm Francine. This is Justin.

64
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,892
- I'm Lauren. Hi.
- You're a photographer, too?

65
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,142
I'm the model.
George is the photographer.

66
00:06:38,227 --> 00:06:41,184
I gotta go.
I roped him into doing a fashion shoot.

67
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,517
Good luck.

68
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,392
Thanks!

69
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:51,934
Shit.

70
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,934
No, I can't use the outs
from the old...

71
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,142
That's not the point, Derek!
The point is I don't want to.

72
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,267
I want new photographs
for a new article.

73
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,101
And I can't find the people that
I got to take pictures of. They're...

74
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,351
I don't know where they are!

75
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,101
I don't know, Derek.
What do bums do on their day off?

76
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,434
That's funny.
Did you make that up?

77
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,059
Not... No.

78
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,559
Not today either.
I can't help you today.

79
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,809
I cannot do
anything today! Why?

80
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:29,559
Because today
I'm gonna shoot Lauren.

81
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,434
Okay? Goodbye!

82
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,684
Tuesday. Hey, boss.

83
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,684
This one's got your name on it.

84
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,184
Hays, get on the stolen car ring.

85
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,559
- What about the Kirby case?
- This is more important.

86
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,642
Than a potential homicide?

87
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,101
Kirby isn't a homicide,
he's a missing person.

88
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,517
I can't tie up the whole force

89
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,726
just because some guy decided
to walk out on his wife.

90
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,059
This is the fourth time the guy's walked
out on his wife in the last two weeks.

91
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,142
- What'd you turn up on the others?
- Nothing, but...

92
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,934
Right, nothing.
So they're filed under missing persons.

93
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,226
Now, if they turn up
great, fine. I'm delighted.

94
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,767
But I can't waste
any more time on this.

95
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,434
- But, Captain, you're not...
- Hays, look.

96
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,976
I don't wanna bore you
with crime statistics,

97
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,809
but, uh, between you and me,
they're not going down.

98
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:41,267
Now, file Kirby under missing persons
and get on with it.

99
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:46,101
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:59,517
Uh, Chief O'Brien, please.
This is Captain Bosch.

101
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:02,767
All right, I'll take it.

102
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,101
- O'Brien.
- Chief, this is Bosch.

103
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,934
Look, I can't keep a lid
on this any longer.

104
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:12,476
- You've got to.
- You don't understand, I can't.

105
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,601
- 'No.'
- Chief!

106
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:16,392
- It's not my decision.
- I know that, but...

107
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:19,851
Well, if you know that, then you know
there's nothing I can do about it.

108
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,976
You've got your orders, Bosch,
now carry them out.

109
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:33,142
- Sanderson?
- Yes, sir.

110
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,309
Sanderson, uh...

111
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,726
Run down the blotter.
Give me everything we've got

112
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,392
in the vicinity
of Lafayette Street.

113
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,267
Hey, Bosch! What's happening?

115
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,142
Nothing for you today... Murph.

116
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:52,434
Nothing, huh?
You know, you cops will never learn.

117
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,809
I said nothing, Murphy.

118
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,476
That's a dead giveaway.
Now, I know something's wrong.

119
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,101
You see, if you guys are smart,
what you do is,

120
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:03,434
you palm me off
a little tidbit of information.

121
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:05,767
That way I'd never know
the difference.

122
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,892
Okay. I'll let you in on it.

123
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,184
I'm about to interrogate
a bag lady

124
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:15,767
we just nabbed
on the charge of petty theft.

125
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:19,059
Not bad...
Not bad, Bosch.

126
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,601
All right. What we got here?

127
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,017
She tried to lift my gun.
I nabbed her.

128
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,434
All by yourself?

129
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:35,601
This happened
at Lafayette and Houston?

130
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,476
- Yeah.
- What's her story?

131
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,226
Who knows? She won't talk.

132
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,184
- You let her make a phone call?
- Who, her?

133
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,601
She's entitled to one call.
Let her make it.

134
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,351
Terrific. Wonderful.
You look great.

135
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:53,809
You look like a million bucks.
You got a date later on tonight?

136
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,226
Give a smile, huh?
Hey, thank you. Come on.

137
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,934
Whoa, what style, what content!

138
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,309
Oh, what art! Oh, my God!
I love this profession!

139
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:03,351
Tony, give me two more stops
on that backlight.

140
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,726
Is this what it's gonna be all day?
All tits and ass,

141
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,392
ass and tits, sell some perfume.
Whose idea was this anyway?

142
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,559
What genius came up with this concept
to sell this perfume today?

143
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,434
You wanna blow this job for me?

144
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,517
What's the matter?
Am I making you nervous?

145
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:21,392
Yeah. This is my first chance
for national exposure.

146
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,892
- Well...
- You're making...

147
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,309
Very well put.

148
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,559
Are you upset
because I'm posing nude?

149
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:29,767
No, I'm not, Lauren.
Posing nude comes with the territory.

150
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:32,434
I'm upset because these people
are using your body

151
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,517
and draping it with the carcass
of some helpless, little field mouse

152
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:38,601
to sell some worthless perfume
which probably smells like sheep shit!

153
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:40,851
What are you shushing me for?
They know it! They made it!

154
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:42,976
They know what's in it
and what it takes to sell it!

155
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,642
Stop it!

156
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,059
I'm sorry, okay?

157
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:54,309
I forgot what all wondrous fun
this was for me.

158
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:56,517
It's a goof, it's a joke.

159
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,601
It doesn't matter.
You don't care about them.

160
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,267
You're doing this for me.

161
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:04,434
We're gonna bamboozle these guys
for big bucks and go home.

162
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,684
Okay?

163
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,476
Okay.

164
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,434
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

165
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,767
'George, this is Derek.

166
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,642
'I am having
a nervous breakdown.

167
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,184
'I've gone ahead
and written the copy without you.

168
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:42,726
'When you give me the pictures,
I'll fudge it to fit them.'

169
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,601
'Lauren Daniels,
this is Dr. Bremner's office.

170
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,934
'Please call when you get a chance.'

171
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,017
'Cooper, you son of a bitch! I'm in jail!

172
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:54,059
'I only get one phone call.

173
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,142
'You think I wanna talk to some
goddamn fucking machine?'

174
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,226
Is that all we got
from Lafayette Street?

175
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,767
- It's all the arrests.
- You got something else?

176
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:12,976
Well, I got this,
uh, missing persons report.

177
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,142
A what?
Why didn't you tell me?

178
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,934
''A.J. Shepherd.''

179
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,309
I wonder if that's the guy
I busted five years ago.

180
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,309
- It's not an official report.
- Then what is it?

181
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,767
It's a little strange.

182
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:37,684
Here you go.

183
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,059
Here you go.

184
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:45,767
Okay.

185
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,517
There you go.
I'm sorry I can't bring you more.

186
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:54,351
- Well, well, A.J. Shepherd.
- Bosch! What are you doing here?

187
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,934
- You called my precinct.
- What is this, some kind of bad joke?

188
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,267
Yeah.

189
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,976
So, what's this all about?

190
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,392
- Reverend?
- Yeah?

191
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:05,767
Would you come here a minute?

192
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,809
What is it, Doris?

193
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,392
Reverend, I have
a present for you.

194
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,767
Oh, oh.

195
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:17,101
Hey, look at that!

196
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,892
- So, you're a reverend now, huh?
- Save it, Bosch.

197
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,101
Now, what kind of scam
you're running here?

198
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,226
- Look, Lieutenant...
- Captain.

199
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,184
- Oh, you're a captain now?
- You got it.

200
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,726
Well, look, Captain,

201
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,684
I didn't call up your precinct
so they would send you down here

202
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:32,892
to hear your two-bit opinion
of my life, all right?

203
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:36,142
Look, just get to the point, Shepherd.
What's this about missing persons?

204
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,976
Oh, Jesus! Would you just
chill out? Please?

205
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:43,851
- It's my family.
- Family?

206
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:47,017
You mean,
your flock, congregation?

207
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:51,059
My regulars. My people here.
You wanna hear this or not?

208
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,601
Shoot.

209
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,851
I've been looking all over
for these people. I can't find 'em.

210
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,351
- Where do you think they'd be?
- Some of them are street people.

211
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,184
They're probably out
on the street somewhere,

212
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,267
but I got undergrounders here,
people who live underground.

213
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:09,351
I know that people
live underground. So what?

214
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,434
So that's the people
that are missing.

215
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,517
Look, in my cellar
I got a hole broken through the wall.

216
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,934
That hooks up
with an old sewer system down there.

217
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,392
It's a regular labyrinth
of tunnels and caves.

218
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:24,226
That's where these people live.
Ten, twelve of my regulars.

219
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,767
They come up here
for soup every day.

220
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,017
Those are the people
that disappeared.

221
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,017
- All of them?
- Yeah, all of them,

222
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:35,684
but it's just my underground people.
You understand that?

223
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,767
Since when?

224
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:41,267
It's been almost
two weeks now.

225
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,642
You haven't seen any of them
for two weeks?

226
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:48,476
- No.
- One guy, Val.

227
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:00,726
Now, you watch your step, Bosch.
Remember, you don't belong here.

228
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,809
Gog and Magog.

229
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:14,476
Yeah, well, uh...

230
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,017
Val, I understand
you used to live underground.

231
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,767
What made you
change your mind?

232
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:25,142
On each side of the throne
there are four living creatures

233
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,892
filled with eyes
in front and behind!

234
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,851
Creatures?

235
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,767
You're talking
about your friends?

236
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,976
Are they still down there?

237
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,184
I know your work.

238
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:49,767
You go by the name
of being alive!

239
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,892
And you are dead!

240
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,767
Now, listen, pal.

241
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,809
They have the power

242
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,517
to shut the sky!

243
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,767
They have the power

244
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,351
to shut the sky.

245
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:15,809
Where the hell
did he get a knife like that?

246
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,226
All the undergrounders
are looking for weapons now, man.

247
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,809
Guns and knives.
I told you to be careful.

248
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,934
Don't be scared.
Where are you goin', man?

249
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,976
- I've gotta go check in.
- Check in?

250
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,517
Hey, Bosch!
Who are you callin'?

251
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:48,851
No. How do I know
you didn't take something.

252
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:52,434
How do I know
you didn't give us anything?

253
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:58,976
You have any idea
why she'd take my gun?

254
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,226
Not any good ones.

255
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,392
- Where you know her from anyway?
- Just around the neighborhood.

256
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,892
Do you go to movies together?
Is she your steady date?

257
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,851
- Get the hell out here.
- Yes, of course.

258
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,059
You ready, honey?

259
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:19,851
- I got him.
- Stay on him.

260
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:28,267
Pigs! Suck a duck!

261
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,351
Hey, Jackson,
they finally let you off the desk, huh?

262
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,934
- Hi, Murph.
- What's happened?

263
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:38,517
Nothing going on.
Same old shit, Murphy.

264
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:40,767
Nothing, huh?
Sounds interesting.

265
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:43,309
Listen, Murphy,
I'm really busy.

266
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,976
Yeah, it's not surprising
what with nothing going on, I mean.

267
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:53,392
You walked up behind a cop
and took his gun?

268
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:56,767
- I tried.
- What do you want with a gun?

269
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,934
It's not for me,
it's for Victor.

270
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:02,767
- Have you got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

271
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:05,476
You have any bandages?

272
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,809
Yeah.

273
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,601
Forget it, Bosch.
I lost him.

274
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:36,142
- Really, you're going through here?
- Yeah.

275
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,851
I don't know why you two couldn't
just live in a big cardboard box

276
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,892
like everybody else.

277
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,226
Here, take this bag.

278
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:04,851
Are you leaving
little breadcrumbs behind

279
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,226
so we can find our way out of here?

280
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,184
- Come on.
- We gotta go through here?

281
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:10,892
Come on!

282
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:13,351
I'm gonna get all dirty.

283
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:16,101
I'm coming, I'm coming.

284
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,892
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Blood!

285
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,142
What the hell!
Why is everybody so afraid?

286
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,892
- Come on.
- What the hell is going on?

287
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,726
- Come on!
- What...

288
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:43,184
You know, Mrs. M,
there's a whole lot you're not telling me.

289
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:44,892
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, look...

290
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,934
Let's start at the beginning.
Why the hell does Victor need a gun?

291
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,726
He needs it,
he says he needs it.

292
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,517
- Yeah, great answer...
- Up here.

293
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,726
- We're gonna go up here?
- Yup. Come on.

294
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,476
- You afraid of heights?
- No.

295
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,476
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Come on!

296
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,476
- Whoa!
- Hugo!

297
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,809
That's the man
who took your picture.

298
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:10,059
You don't remember him?

299
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,642
Sure, you do.

300
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,517
Okay, come on.

301
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,351
Oh, my god, what the hell
happened to him?

302
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,267
Did you get it?

303
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:33,559
- Did you get the gun?
- No.

304
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:35,351
I got some bandages.

305
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:39,476
I don't need no bandages.
I need a gun.

306
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,142
What do you want
a gun for, Victor?

307
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:45,476
Shoot...
Shoot them.

308
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,351
- Shoot who?
- Ugly fuckers.

309
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,476
What ugly fuckers?

310
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,601
Mean, ugly fucker
that comes around here.

311
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:56,142
- What's he talkin' about?
- He's sick!

312
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,476
Can't you see he's wounded?

313
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,059
Right, Victor...

314
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,017
Do you remember me,
George Cooper?

315
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:06,226
I don't know if you remember, but...
We ought to get this cleaned up.

316
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,351
Maybe put a new bandage on it,
maybe get you to a hospital.

317
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,809
- I don't need any hospital!
- Hugo!

318
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:13,267
Don't you hurt him.

319
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,726
Don't hurt him.

320
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,767
He's gonna help us.

321
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,642
'A bag lady
tried to steal a gun.

322
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,726
'The guy who bailed her out
is George Cooper.

323
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,934
'He shot an article on the people
down there. I have a copy of it right here.'

324
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:51,892
This article doesn't identify
any of the people in these pictures.

325
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,851
I thought maybe, you could.

326
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:56,059
Why don't you ask
the photographer?

327
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:59,642
Frankly, I can't decide
whether to talk to him or tail him.

328
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:03,101
It's a buck dancer's choice,
my friend.

329
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,267
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it?

330
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:07,184
I don't get...
I don't get you, brother.

331
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,476
You run in and out of here
like the fucking Mad Hatter...

332
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,559
You don't even know what you're looking
for, Bosch! You make me nervous.

333
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,517
I just want to know
if you know any of these people.

334
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:17,892
Why do you want to know them?
What's the motivation here, Captain?

335
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,601
Puttin' in so much of your time

336
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,351
to help me track down
a few undergrounders? Come on!

337
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,851
Alright, there are other people
missing as well.

338
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:28,392
Aha.
Who? Important people?

339
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,184
Your call wasn't
the only one we got.

340
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,267
We've had several
missing persons reports

341
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:36,351
from this neighborhood
in the last two weeks.

342
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,267
- Still doesn't wash, Bosch.
- Look, am I wasting my time...?

343
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:41,559
Hey, I put in a call...
A missing persons complaint...

344
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:45,059
I get a police captain
coming down here twice, in one day.

345
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,309
Fishy, fishy.

346
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,976
Is everybody getting scared?

347
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,309
You tell me who's missing, Bosch.

348
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:57,142
We lose the mayor down there?
Or the president?

349
00:25:57,227 --> 00:26:00,517
- Or your mom disappear?
- My wife.

350
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,892
Alright?

351
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,934
Alright.

352
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,392
Why didn't you tell me this?

353
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,892
Look, I'm really sorry.

354
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:26,601
When did it happen?

355
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,392
Late last night.

356
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:34,392
She must've gone out
to walk the dog.

357
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:37,226
Hey, do you live around here?

358
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,851
Couple of blocks over.

359
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:44,684
Look, Bosch.
You gotta be straight with me.

360
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:58,226
This lady's name is
Mrs. Monroe.

361
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,226
She doesn't live down here,
her brother lives down here.

362
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,851
- Hey, wait, this is him. That's him.
- Victor. That's his buddy, Hugo.

363
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,726
They're undergrounders.

364
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,142
God...

365
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,976
George Cooper.

366
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,017
I don't know him,
but I've seen him around.

367
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,601
Okay?

368
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,892
Does that help you any?

369
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,601
Maybe.

370
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,142
Alright.

371
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,892
Your turn.

372
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:32,309
You tell me somethin'.

373
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:33,809
What?

374
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,142
About the EPA probe.

375
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,559
- What about it?
- You tell me.

376
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,434
It's a routine inspection
of the subways and sewers.

377
00:27:45,518 --> 00:27:48,017
It happens every year.
How do you know about it?

378
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,809
I always know
when that probe's going on.

379
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,226
My customers
start gettin' jumpy.

380
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:57,059
Those clowns, they go down
there in their space suits.

381
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,976
They scare everybody
out of there.

382
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,267
- It's usually over in a week, right?
- So?

383
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,059
So, this year
it's been going on for four weeks.

384
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:08,226
It's still going on.
Didn't you know that?

385
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,142
Come on.

386
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,934
The week after everybody
disappeared,

387
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:34,976
I called the Environmental
Protection Agency.

388
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,184
- I asked 'em what was going on.
- What'd they say?

389
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:39,351
They said nothing's going on.

390
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,434
They said the probe
was over for three weeks,

391
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,351
that no one had been
down there since.

392
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,142
Why would they lie about it?

393
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,392
God, you don't have a clue,
do you, Sherlock?

394
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,476
This ain't no disco.

395
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,351
There's all sorts of shit
down there.

396
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:57,476
Hey, let me show you
some of the stuff I found.

397
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:04,392
Check this out.

398
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,684
Huh? You like?

399
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:12,142
Okay. Look at this.

400
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,267
N- R-C. You know what this is?

401
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,601
This thing detects
accumulated radiation,

402
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:20,226
they wear these things
in nuclear power plants.

403
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,142
How do you know that?

404
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,601
I used to be
a nuclear physicist.

405
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:27,559
I saw it on TV.

406
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,142
Alright.

407
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,892
Let's go.

408
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,851
So, anyway, this stuff
made me very curious.

409
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,476
I called up the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

410
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,601
Tell them that I wanted to return some
of their stolen property that I'd found.

411
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:46,559
- Mm-hm.
- The guy on the phone got nervous.

412
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,184
Started you know...

413
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:51,142
Passing me on to people...
Passing me on to two other droids.

414
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:53,892
Nobody wanted to come up
with any explanations to me.

415
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:57,351
But they were insistent on knowing
who I was, who I talked to...

416
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,267
- Where I'd been.
- Yeah, I get the point.

417
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,017
Yeah, good.

418
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,226
Here, hold this.

419
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,476
- You're going down there?
- Yup.

420
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,642
- What the hell's this food about?
- Oh, I left that for the shy ones.

421
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:12,101
It's a scary world up there.

422
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:15,809
Looks like they lost
their appetite.

423
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,309
Ugh. Smells great down here.

424
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,476
Hey. Whoa.

425
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,267
- What is it?
- Looks like a Geiger counter.

426
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,642
I told you there was
something going on.

427
00:30:31,727 --> 00:30:33,809
Well, let's see.

428
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:57,934
What the hell was that?

429
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,934
- Hi.
- Can we talk now?

430
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:12,642
- I uh...
- George, sit down.

431
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,892
I gotta develop some photographs
and get them over to Derek's. I gotta.

432
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,892
I'm pregnant.

433
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,101
Oh, on second thought,
maybe Derek can wait a while.

434
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:27,767
Dr. Bremner called
this afternoon, it's official.

435
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,684
I'm pregnant.

436
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,101
- You're going to have a baby?
- Hm.

437
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,892
That is one of the side effects
of being pregnant.

438
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:44,767
There are alternatives.

439
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:48,267
Dr. Bremner wanted to know
if I was interested in, uh...

440
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:50,351
The alternative.

441
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:52,559
What'd you say?

442
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,101
I told him I'd let him know.

443
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:59,976
- Are you interested in an alternative?
- I don't know.

444
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,142
I'm sitting here, trying to think
if it's fair to bring a child into the world

445
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:06,809
who's gonna have a zombie father
that won't talk to anybody.

446
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:08,642
Me?

447
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,726
Yeah.

448
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,809
Lauren, do you...
Do you wanna have a kid?

449
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,809
I don't know!

450
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:21,392
I'm thinking about everything, you know,
that I never thought about doing...

451
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:24,059
- Gone.
- Not necessarily.

452
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,642
Do you want me to have a kid?

453
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,392
I'll support
whatever decision you make.

454
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:32,226
But I think
that it's gotta be your decision.

455
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,642
I don't believe it. You're not going
to tell me if you want me to have a kid?

456
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:39,392
Look, it's not fair! It's your body,
it's your career, all that stuff.

457
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,392
And... Our baby.

458
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:45,059
If I said that I wanted to have it,
would you want to have it?

459
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,642
- Yeah.
- Alright.

460
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:51,559
We're having a kid.

461
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:12,976
George and Lauren aren't in
right now, but if you want to,

462
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,142
leave a message
when you hear the beep.

463
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,726
Beep.

464
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,934
'Look, George, I'm trying
to maintain my sense of humor.

465
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:24,809
'But you said you'd be here two hours
ago. Was that a joke? Please tell me.

466
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:27,559
'I'd like to laugh too.'

467
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:36,351
Crosby and Spring.

468
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:39,184
I think it is.
Look both ways.

469
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:45,476
Before any cars come,
nothing's coming, remember that?

470
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,142
Honey, I want to go
into this phone booth and...

471
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,976
We'll have to wake Uncle Art.

472
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,267
And find out where we're going.
Come on in, dear.

473
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,976
And close the door.

474
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:04,684
Just wait a minute, hon.
Stay there.

475
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:13,642
6-7...

476
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,809
3...

477
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:24,976
Art...

478
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,184
Art, I'm sorry to wake you,
I'm sorry to wake you.

479
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,684
Yeah, yeah, we're here.
We're here.

480
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:35,809
Uh, but uh... We got on
the subway downtown, but...

481
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:38,559
We're lost, Art.
We're lost...

482
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,809
- What's going on?
- We have a kid who's hysterical.

483
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:18,601
She's makin' up a story.

484
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,017
- What makes you think it's a story?
- What? Are you kidding?

485
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:25,351
She says some monster came out
of the sewer and ate her grandfather.

486
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:34,642
Sanderson, get me
Chief O'Brien.

487
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,934
- Sir...
- Just get him.

488
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,976
Jackson. Post men
on all the street corners

489
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,267
within a 10 block radius
of Lafayette and Spring.

490
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,351
At least two men per corner.

491
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,934
- All of them?
- All of them.

492
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,642
Pull them off other precincts,
if you have to.

493
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:51,392
Then cover the subways.
At least four men per station.

494
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:53,851
Put out an APB on Flora Bosch.

495
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:57,059
- Your wife?
- Sir, I've got O'Brien.

496
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:03,059
O'Brien?
You call the Commissioner's office

497
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:05,101
and tell him we're coming
there at 12 o'clock sharp.

498
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:07,684
'Oh, and uh...
Tell him to have someone

499
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:10,351
'from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission with him.

500
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,976
Are you crazy, Bosch?

501
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,684
- 'I can't tell him that.'
- You tell him.

502
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:17,767
'And tell him if he's not there,
he can pick up the afternoon papers

503
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:21,142
'and read all about his involvement
in the NRC cover-up.'

504
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,476
Hey, Bosch, can't get enough, huh?

505
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,309
You got it, Rev. Come on, grab
your evidence. You're coming with me.

506
00:36:31,393 --> 00:36:34,976
- Where are you going?
- We got a date downtown.

507
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:41,392
What do we need
this guy for, anyway?

508
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:45,809
Are you kidding? I accused the goddamn
Commissioner of a cover-up.

509
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,059
- You got me.
- Yeah.

510
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,767
I got you.

511
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:56,017
And a six year old kid
who thinks she saw a monster.

512
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:58,059
If this guy doesn't have
somethin' solid, I'm through.

513
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:01,351
- Hey, Cooper. Open up!
- He's not there.

514
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:04,101
What do you wanna do?

515
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,809
Well, we gotta
get in there, somehow.

516
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:17,267
Hey, that's breaking and entering.
You're...

517
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:19,351
...under arrest, Shepherd.

518
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:30,601
Hey, this is your friend
from the magazine, isn't it?

519
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:32,851
That's Victor, yeah.

520
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:36,017
- What the... What's this?
- It's his leg.

521
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,809
Oh, my god...

522
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:41,017
Holy shit.

523
00:37:41,102 --> 00:37:45,434
Gentlemen, may I present Mr. Wilson
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

524
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,809
Chief O'Brien,
Captain Bosch, and uh...

525
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,434
A.J.

526
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,059
And Mr. A.J.

527
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:55,267
Alright, Captain.

528
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,726
I guess, this is your meeting.

529
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,059
It'd better be good.

530
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:05,684
As you all know...

531
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:09,351
I've recently been ordered to ignore
what amounts to, uh...

532
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:13,267
An alarming number
of disappearances in my precinct.

533
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:16,601
We're all here right now,
because...

534
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,101
I can't do that anymore.

535
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,476
For one thing,
I have reason to believe

536
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,559
that a number of these people
have been murdered.

537
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:27,726
And I believe that these murders are
somehow connected to the probe

538
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,142
that's going on underneath the streets
of this city at this very moment.

539
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,017
Nonsense, Bosch.

540
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,642
Look, we're as concerned about
those disappearances as you are.

541
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:38,767
But there's no evidence of murder.

542
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:42,601
And as to any connection
with the underground... Preposterous.

543
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,392
It's hot down there,
Commissioner.

544
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:48,476
Don't tell me the NRC
doesn't know about that.

545
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,434
Mr. Wilson.

546
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:55,434
Is this why I was invited
to this meeting?

547
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,934
Who is this man?

548
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,517
I went to this man's
soup kitchen last night...

549
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:07,892
Soup kitchen!

550
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,184
Because he reported
12 people missing.

551
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:15,017
And he took me down where these
people used to live, underground.

552
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,101
And that's where we found
this Geiger counter.

553
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:21,559
Granted, that doesn't necessarily
implicate you, sir.

554
00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,892
But let me tell you what happened.

555
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:28,392
We turned it on, it was still working,
and it began to surge.

556
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:30,309
We were standing still.

557
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,392
But this thing went
as high as it could go.

558
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:34,392
It lit up like a god damn
Christmas tree!

559
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:36,476
Then it eased right back down to normal,

560
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,851
like something hot
was moving down there.

561
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,601
Nonsense, Bosch.

562
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:42,559
Quite often, there's a, uh...

563
00:39:42,643 --> 00:39:45,642
Surge when you turn those things on,
it's a typical equipment malfunction.

564
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:47,392
It doesn't mean a thing.

565
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:49,726
What about all the stuff
we found down there?

566
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,101
I can't be held responsible for everything
that washes up in the sewer.

567
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,601
Anything else?

568
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:01,017
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

569
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:03,017
A young girl saw something.

570
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:06,809
She said it was a monster. Dragged
her grandfather down into the sewers.

571
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:11,517
Do you have anything else?

572
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,351
That's what I thought.

573
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:15,476
Forget this!

574
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,684
Wasting my time here.

575
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:20,601
You guys wouldn't know the truth
if it came up and bit you!

576
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,017
I'll take my pictures
somewhere else.

577
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:25,476
Pictures?

578
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,934
Yeah. I took a camera down there,
I took some pictures.

579
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,476
But you guys
wouldn't be interested.

580
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,309
Well, you want to see 'em?

581
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:34,934
Do you?

582
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,892
Well, I'll...
I'll show you one.

583
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:42,184
This is a picture of a man
that saw a monster.

584
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,851
Here's a picture of a bite
taken out of his leg.

585
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:51,351
Does that look like anything
you've ever seen before?

586
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:54,434
Here's a close-up of it.

587
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,934
Maybe you have
some glib explanation for that!

588
00:40:58,352 --> 00:41:00,684
Now, do you wanna talk
about this?

589
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:03,851
Or should I go discuss this
with the newspapers?

590
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,434
I was just thinking...

591
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:14,017
Uh-oh. What were you
just thinking?

592
00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:16,726
If we're gonna have a kid,
where are we going to live?

593
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,226
I thought that was settled.
We sell your father's house,

594
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,351
- we get a place of our own.
- Yeah, but I was thinking

595
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:24,851
why sell one place to live in,
just to get another?

596
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:26,976
- Wow.
- It's a nice house.

597
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,809
It'd be a nice place
for a kid growing up.

598
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,642
Yeah, but it's in the suburbs.

599
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:35,309
- Oh, no.
- Safe.

600
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,767
I hate to think of our kids
growing up here. It's scary.

601
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:40,976
My work is here.

602
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,434
Millbrook's a nice town.

603
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:50,476
Lots of quaint,
old aldermen and ancient farmers.

604
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:54,892
I don't want to talk about it now,
I'm in too good a mood.

605
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,892
- I might agree to anything.
- Yeah?

606
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,934
Glad to hear that.

607
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,642
I think it's time you and I
had a little talk, Mr. Cooper.

608
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:05,809
Who are you?

609
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,809
That's the problem.

610
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:10,101
I know who you are.

611
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:12,559
George Cooper,
prominent fashion photographer.

612
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:13,934
Nobody knows me.

613
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:16,351
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you?

614
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:18,892
Murphy. Freelance reporter.

615
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:22,851
You know
you were wearing a tail yesterday?

616
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,892
- What?
- That's right.

617
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,392
From the police department,
no less.

618
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,559
You must be a pretty important
fella, fella.

619
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:35,309
This should go
no further than this room.

620
00:42:35,393 --> 00:42:38,351
About three weeks ago,
the Environmental Protection Agency

621
00:42:38,435 --> 00:42:43,559
encountered slightly elevated radiation
levels in the Lafayette Street area.

622
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:45,809
Well, where's this radioactivity
coming from?

623
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:49,017
Do you remember that story that leaked
out about us wanting to, uh...

624
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:52,767
transport radioactive materials
through Manhattan?

625
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:55,392
Sure. There was a big stink
about it in the press.

626
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:58,559
Didn't somebody get a court order
restraining you from doing it?

627
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,726
That's right.
The case is still under appeal.

628
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,517
In the meantime,
we can't move the stuff.

629
00:43:04,602 --> 00:43:06,517
You see, it's already here.

630
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:10,809
The order is preventing us from,
uh... moving it out.

631
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:14,226
'George Cooper.

632
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,059
'Suddenly just chucks it all,
and drops out of sight.

633
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,726
'Resurfaces six months
later with a...

634
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,517
'An award winning pictorial essay on
derelicts who hang out in the sewers.'

635
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,101
So?

636
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:28,184
Look, everybody wants
to be rich and famous.

637
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:31,309
But given the choice,
most people prefer to be rich.

638
00:43:31,393 --> 00:43:33,392
It's really rare to find someone
who prefers fame.

639
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:37,351
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Sure, you do. I prefer fame myself.

640
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:39,934
- Just hasn't come my way, yet.
- That is not why I did it.

641
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:43,351
- Oh, of course not.
- He wasn't out to win any awards.

642
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:45,767
Just wanted to do
something relevant.

643
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:48,267
- Oh! Relevant!
- Yeah.

644
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:51,851
Oh. That's a bad word. It went off
the okay word list years ago.

645
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,267
Look, what is this all about? What do
you want? An interview or something?

646
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:57,351
- I want a story.
- A story about what?

647
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,434
- About the sewer people.
- Oh, I see.

648
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:01,934
I did a story about some people
who happen to live in the sewer.

649
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:04,517
I'm not a reporter, I don't want to have
anything to do with the press.

650
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,101
- Goodbye.
- Forget the press!

651
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:09,184
What about the people
down in the sewer?

652
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:12,059
- Come on, now.
- You figure it out.

653
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:15,934
You may not know, but there's NRC men
crawling all over this goddamn city.

654
00:44:16,018 --> 00:44:18,934
Something's going wrong, and it's so
bad, nobody wants to talk about it.

655
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:23,517
The cops are going nuts trying to figure
out why a bag lady wants a hand gun.

656
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:30,017
They even start following you.

657
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:36,101
How does this tie in
with the people that are missing?

658
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:39,684
- Well, now...
- I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to him.

659
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:42,601
- There's no cause to be insolent, here.
- Eat it!

660
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:44,767
What about the disappearances?

661
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,976
I'm aware
of some alleged disappearances.

662
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,267
The little girl said
that she saw a monster!

663
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:51,184
- Was she right?
- I don't know.

664
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,934
- I think she was.
- I'm not prepared to, uh...

665
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:55,934
concede the existence
of any monster.

666
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,684
The fact that these people
are disappearing

667
00:44:58,768 --> 00:45:00,934
at the same time
that your guys go down.

668
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:04,142
You're telling me that that is just
some sort of bizarre coincidence?

669
00:45:04,227 --> 00:45:07,309
We don't have to listen to the lunatic
ravings of this paranoid hippie.

670
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:10,017
I just want to know
what is going on here!

671
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:12,601
Why? So you can get your name
in the papers?

672
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:15,351
- So I can help!
- We don't want your help.

673
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:18,642
Why not? I don't believe this,
I just... I don't believe you!

674
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:21,226
What are you trying to hide?

675
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:24,017
You saw it.

676
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:26,184
You saw the monster.

677
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,309
Is that what
you're going to tell the paper?

678
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,017
That you're afraid of monsters?

679
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,142
It's just what I'm going to tell them,
if you don't fill me in!

680
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:35,351
Go ahead, go scream
your fool head off.

681
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:37,517
This has been really fun, boys.

682
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,684
You, at least you...
You kept your mouth shut.

683
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,976
You're a fool.

684
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,684
And you, sir, are a liar!

685
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,767
- I'll see you all on the front page...
- You've got no evidence.

686
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:52,059
You're blind, buddy!

687
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,434
Have a nice day.

688
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,684
Long hair, carrying a paper bag.
He just left.

689
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,059
Follow him. High priority.

690
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:17,809
You're an idiot, Bosch, you know that?
You've really done it now.

691
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,101
- C.H.U.D.?
- What?

692
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:23,726
- C-H-U-D.
- Here, let me see.

693
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:28,601
Give me that. Where do you think
you are, high school?

694
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,351
- That's a classified government file.
- And what does it stand for?

695
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,476
- That's not important.
- I'm through playing games.

696
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,642
Either you tell me what
C.H.U.D. stands for,

697
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,851
or I'm going to the newspapers.

698
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:42,101
- Well, I have to get clearance.
- You got a call on four.

699
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,017
Wilson here.

700
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:49,226
What? Really?

701
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:52,434
Okay, you know what to do.

702
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,934
Two gas company guys
just found it.

703
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:00,517
A cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

704
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,351
A C.H.U.D. Alright?

705
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,642
It's dead.

706
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:50,517
- Mr. Wilson.
- Doctor.

707
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:53,892
It's good to see you. You'll have to put
on one of these suits before we go in.

708
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:55,476
Gentlemen.

709
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,101
There's every indication
this once was human.

710
00:48:01,185 --> 00:48:03,517
It's dressed in the rags
of a Bowery bum.

711
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:26,267
- Well, let's have it.
- You realize this is just preliminary.

712
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:28,309
- Yes, yes, of course.
- It was a gas leak, alright.

713
00:48:28,393 --> 00:48:31,517
- Death by asphyxiation.
- Good. Thank you.

714
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,059
Okay, that's it.
I'm going ahead with the clean- up.

715
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:38,142
Well, wait... Wait a minute.

716
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,642
How do you know there aren't
more of those things down there?

717
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:43,184
Of course there aren't any more.
It was a freak accident.

718
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,851
It couldn't happen again.
I'm sending my men back to work.

719
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:48,517
Alright, you do that.
But I'm sending a team

720
00:48:48,602 --> 00:48:51,351
armed with flame throwers
right down there with them.

721
00:48:51,435 --> 00:48:54,892
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- You what?

722
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:57,226
I can't afford the publicity.

723
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,226
If you do that, every paper
in town will be onto it.

724
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,267
- Well, I can fix it, so they won't.
- You won't do it at all.

725
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:06,601
If I have to make it an order,
I'll make it an order.

726
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:09,017
I don't take orders from you!

727
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:14,351
Sorry, Bosch.
Wilson's in charge.

728
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:19,601
I understand how you feel. But like it
or not, we're gonna do this my way.

729
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:31,642
Okay, I'm on the bottom now.
Do you read me?

730
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:42,351
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

731
00:49:42,435 --> 00:49:46,976
Alright, men. Fan out
and form a solid line across the tunnel.

732
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:53,184
Now, Bosch. You leave this to me.
Just watch the monitor.

733
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,517
You'll see
there's nothing down there.

734
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,392
Son of a bitch.

735
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:06,642
- Parker, this is Bosch. You read me?
- 'Loud and clear.'

736
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:08,934
Roger. Hang on.

737
00:50:10,352 --> 00:50:12,934
- We're ready.
- You're making a big mistake.

738
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:15,101
- Beg your pardon?
- You've had your laugh,

739
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:18,976
- now get those men out of there.
- I'm busy, Wilson.

740
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,351
- Benson?
- 'Yes, sir?'

741
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,601
- Get those cops outta there.
- What, are you kidding?

742
00:50:24,685 --> 00:50:27,851
Your man has a camera.
Mine has a flame thrower.

743
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,934
Okay, Parker, move 'em out.

744
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:54,767
'We're at the first intersection.'

745
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,101
Which way?

746
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:59,601
You're a college graduate.
You figure it out.

747
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:01,934
I can wait as long as you can.

748
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,351
The, uh...

749
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:11,017
The north tunnel.

750
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:14,434
Take the north tunnel.
But check it out, first.

751
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,934
'Everything looks clear.

752
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:24,142
- 'We're moving out.'
- Don't take any chances.

753
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:26,434
First sign of trouble,
get the hell outta there.

754
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,976
Move it!

755
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,559
I think I see something moving
up ahead in the tunnel.

756
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,601
Get those flame throwers working.

757
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:49,059
- I'm trying to see what it is first.
- Forget it.

758
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:51,809
'If it isn't saying hello,
I don't care what it is.'

759
00:51:58,602 --> 00:52:01,059
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.

760
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:04,017
- Tell them to speed it up.
- 'Radiation level's going up.'

761
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:08,226
- I see something, there in the flames!
- Are you crazy?

762
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:12,351
- Nothing could possibly survive in...
- 'Radiation level's going up!'

763
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:17,434
Parker?

764
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,767
Parker!

765
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,351
I've got to go along with
Bosch now, Wilson.

766
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:32,309
- The people have to be warned.
- No.

767
00:52:32,393 --> 00:52:35,601
Come on, Wilson. How many
of those things do you think there are?

768
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,017
- We'll stop them.
- How?

769
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:40,976
- With gas.
- Gas?

770
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,184
We can't use gas,
it's too dangerous.

771
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,184
My men are doing
an autopsy right now.

772
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:49,434
They'll come up with
a dozen ways to kill those things.

773
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:51,934
Meantime we just sit around
on our thumbs, right?

774
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,434
Come on, Bosch,
you've got men out all over the city.

775
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,601
Who's gonna get hurt?

776
00:52:56,685 --> 00:53:00,976
Yeah, admittedly, the guy's a little wacky,
but suppose for an instant that he's right?

777
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,934
So what if he is?
We don't want to get involved.

778
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:07,059
I've been down there,
you know?

779
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,101
Well, is there
something going on?

780
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,017
No, there's nothing
going on, but...

781
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,351
So leave it alone.

782
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,767
Gone.

783
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:38,559
Prints of Victor's leg are gone.

784
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:42,351
And that's
the only thing that's...

785
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:45,142
Honey, have you been
in my dark room?

786
00:53:45,227 --> 00:53:46,934
No.

787
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,642
Hello, Murphy?
This is George Cooper.

788
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:10,351
I want my photographs back.
I think we ought to have a little talk.

789
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:13,351
I'll meet you on the northbound side
of Chambers Street station

790
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:16,017
in about half-hour. Bye.

791
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,934
You look terrible.
What the hell happened to you?

792
00:54:54,018 --> 00:54:56,559
Nothing.

793
00:55:07,518 --> 00:55:09,351
What's going on, Bosch?

794
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:11,892
I saw our monster.

795
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,267
We're not going anywhere
and I'm not showing you anything

796
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,184
unless you give me
my pictures back.

797
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,184
I don't have your pictures.
The police have your pictures.

798
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:28,267
Police. You're still
putting out that crap?

799
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,351
Why would the police
take my photographs?

800
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,642
- There's a cover-up going on.
- Cover-up.

801
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:35,392
You write this political bullshit?
Cover-up of what?

802
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:37,892
I don't know, because I don't know
what was in those photographs.

803
00:55:37,977 --> 00:55:39,809
The only way to find out
is for us to go down there.

804
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:43,559
- You wanna go down there?
- Yeah, I wanna go down there. Now.

805
00:55:48,018 --> 00:55:51,601
Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

806
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,434
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin'.

807
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:57,767
God.

808
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,767
- What are we gonna do, Bosch?
- I don't know.

809
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:05,142
Wilson is toying with the idea
of flooding the sewers with gas.

810
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:08,142
What? God, that guy is a madman!

811
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:10,392
He is a madman.

812
00:56:10,477 --> 00:56:12,642
Gas could drive those
things up here.

813
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:14,559
Great, great.

814
00:56:15,935 --> 00:56:19,351
What I'm saying is,
this isn't the safest place to be.

815
00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:22,267
I heard you the first time.

816
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:24,976
You wanna lift somewhere?

817
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,476
No, I gotta cook dinner.

818
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:33,684
Keep your eye on that flame.

819
00:56:41,102 --> 00:56:42,601
We can't wait any longer.

820
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:45,351
I've ordered my men
to prep the city gas lines.

821
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,434
We'll seal off
every tunnel in the area,

822
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:50,559
divert some of the gas mains
back into those tunnels.

823
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:53,351
If there are
any more incidents, we'll...

824
00:56:53,435 --> 00:56:55,892
We'll turn
those mains back on.

825
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:59,601
Are you crazy?
You'll blow up the whole city!

826
00:56:59,685 --> 00:57:03,476
I'm not gonna flood the whole city,
only, uh, a section of Soho.

827
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:14,601
- Shh...
- What?

828
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,351
You hear something?

829
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,101
No.

830
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,184
Listen, I did.

831
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:27,434
Holy...

832
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,601
What the hell
are you doing with a gun?

833
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,559
You said Victor knows something.

834
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,809
If Victor wants a gun,
I want a gun.

835
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:57,017
Come on.

836
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,309
Light. Light. Ah!

837
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,226
Hey, Val!

838
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:31,476
Hey, Val!

839
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,684
Val.

840
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:38,101
Jesus!

841
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,267
Hey, look, Val, man.
You got to get out of here.

842
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:42,684
Get out of here, man.
It's dangerous.

843
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:46,851
Look, the sky's falling.
The sky's gonna shut.

844
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:49,184
It's gonna shut, Val.

845
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:54,351
Go on.

846
00:58:56,643 --> 00:58:58,559
Get out.

847
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:02,226
- Sky.
- Sky, yeah. Get out.

848
00:59:02,643 --> 00:59:04,309
Go on.

849
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:09,309
Sky... Sky!

850
00:59:14,352 --> 00:59:15,809
Val?

851
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:20,059
Val?

852
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:22,059
Oh!

853
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:30,517
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

854
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,767
Wilson!

855
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:44,476
Wilson... Wilson!

856
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,309
Wilson! Wilson!

857
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:49,059
Wilson!

858
00:59:57,268 --> 01:00:00,059
Now, this is it.
We have to go right through here.

859
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:03,351
Oh, you and your damn gun!
Come on.

860
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:11,101
That's it, Murphy. You're on your own
as far as I'm concerned.

861
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,184
I told you, I didn't want
any more of this bullshit.

862
01:00:13,268 --> 01:00:14,976
I mean, I have to be down...

863
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:20,142
Shit.

864
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:29,351
Murphy!

865
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,226
Goddammit.

866
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,517
Shit.

867
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,309
Damn it.

868
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,309
Oh, shit.

869
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:39,809
Are you the one who found it?

870
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:41,642
Where is it?

871
01:06:05,643 --> 01:06:07,309
Oh, my God,
it's his wife!

872
01:06:07,393 --> 01:06:09,309
Shit!

873
01:06:09,393 --> 01:06:11,934
- Get him out of there.
- Come on! Come on!

874
01:06:12,018 --> 01:06:13,642
Come on!

875
01:06:35,893 --> 01:06:38,392
Why don't you
let us take you home?

876
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:42,142
Home?

877
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,684
- Bosch, come on.
- She...

878
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,059
She just went back to college.

879
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,559
She always wanted to teach.

880
01:07:08,518 --> 01:07:10,851
Used to stay up half the night.

881
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,184
Studying.

882
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,559
Then she'd go out and...

883
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:25,392
...walk the dog.

884
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,892
Yeah, police?

885
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:34,142
I found a mangled dog
hanging in my basement

886
01:07:34,227 --> 01:07:37,142
and I'd like to have someone
come check it out.

887
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,517
Uh, 7 of 6.

888
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:06,309
- Cut it out, will you?
- Moron!

889
01:10:11,643 --> 01:10:15,351
- What'll it be, boys?
- Rare cheeseburger and a coke.

890
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:18,101
- Same here.
- Coming up.

891
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:23,142
- Nice legs.
- Stop it.

892
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:25,392
- I heard that.
- Yeah?

893
01:10:25,477 --> 01:10:27,809
I bet you heard it before too.

894
01:10:27,893 --> 01:10:29,059
Go on.

895
01:11:03,268 --> 01:11:06,267
Where'd you learn to cook like this?

896
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,059
You're asking for it.

897
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,601
I've been asking for it
all my life.

898
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:16,267
Just never get it.

899
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:19,309
- Shouldn't you boys be on duty?
- Nah.

900
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,351
Justin!

901
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:25,559
Justin, dinner!

902
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,684
Justin!

903
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:55,184
'Two minutes
to air time. Are you ready to go?'

904
01:12:55,268 --> 01:12:57,476
'Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

905
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:01,809
'It doesn't make any sense.
No witnesses, no bodies, just blood.

906
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:04,559
'And the place is crawling...
But the officials won't talk.'

907
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:06,226
What the hell is this?

908
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:23,684
Right in this area.
I want your team to take the north,

909
01:13:23,768 --> 01:13:26,017
yours south,
yours east, yours west.

910
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:29,351
I want ever manhole sealed off
in a 10 block radius. Right?

911
01:13:29,435 --> 01:13:32,017
Forget about the water mains.
Concentrate on the gas mains

912
01:13:32,102 --> 01:13:34,101
and the sewer mains.
Forget about subway grating.

913
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:36,184
Now remember, those trucks
are rigged to explode

914
01:13:36,268 --> 01:13:38,226
on impact from below
so watch the potholes.

915
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,017
God!

916
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,142
Victor!

917
01:15:06,852 --> 01:15:09,517
You killed my brother!

918
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:16,809
- You Cooper?
- Yeah.

919
01:15:16,893 --> 01:15:18,642
- You all right?
- Who are you?

920
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,601
I run the soup kitchen.

921
01:15:20,685 --> 01:15:22,142
- On Kenmore.
- Yeah, right.

922
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:24,351
Man, this is crazy.

923
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:26,517
- Come on.
- Thank God they deliver!

924
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,851
Have you seen enough?
Is this enough for you?

925
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:58,976
We can't wait any longer.
We have to start pumping gas.

926
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,351
What about the subways?
What about the power lines?

927
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:05,142
If we stop the subways,
we'll kill every power line under the city.

928
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,601
Why not? I mean,
you've killed everybody here.

929
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:11,392
All these people are dead
because of you, Wilson.

930
01:16:11,477 --> 01:16:13,934
My wife is dead because of you,
you son of a bitch!

931
01:16:14,018 --> 01:16:15,184
Easy, Bosch. Easy.

932
01:16:15,268 --> 01:16:17,892
This is your responsibility, Wilson.

933
01:16:17,977 --> 01:16:20,476
Someone's got to stop you
and it's gonna have to be me.

934
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,142
You go back to the car, Captain.
You understand me?

935
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:26,726
You go back to that car
and you wait for further orders, Captain.

936
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:39,726
The media is not gonna
wait much longer.

937
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:42,142
We're going to have
to make it a statement.

938
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:46,351
Shit.

939
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:50,726
'I'm standing in front of what appears
to be the scene of a massacre.

940
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:53,476
'But so far there has been
no official confirmation

941
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,726
'as to exactly what happened here.

942
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:57,642
'In fact, at the present time'

943
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,476
no one even will confirm
that anyone was killed.

944
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,351
There are, uh, seven manholes
at that intersection.

945
01:17:05,435 --> 01:17:08,642
These are the only two
that go anywhere. Seal 'em.

946
01:17:11,185 --> 01:17:14,726
So as a precaution we're going
to kill the power to the subways

947
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,892
and close down the stations.

948
01:17:16,977 --> 01:17:19,476
'Are you saying
that a gas explosion

949
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,559
- 'caused the wreck of this diner?'
- 'I'm not saying that.

950
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:25,892
'And it would be imprudent
to speculate on that at this point.

951
01:17:25,977 --> 01:17:30,101
'I'm merely saying that a situation
exists that's made it necessary

952
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:32,559
'for us to temporarily divert
some of the gas lines

953
01:17:32,643 --> 01:17:35,142
'into the city's sewer system.'

954
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:49,184
Now, what the hell is this?

955
01:18:49,268 --> 01:18:51,142
- He started.
- He started what?

956
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,226
- Closing off the fucking tunnels.
- Why?

957
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:55,976
They're gonna start pumping gas
down here to kill those things.

958
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,726
- This is the only way that I know.
- Let's beat 'em to the next one.

959
01:19:09,518 --> 01:19:11,392
Goddammit!

960
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,309
Get up!

961
01:20:18,393 --> 01:20:22,434
Holy shit, man! Holy shit!
This is... Look at this!

962
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:25,267
- This is radiation.
- I know.

963
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:39,726
Wait! Wait, wait.
Wait! What is this?

964
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,726
This is more of that radioactive shit.

965
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,726
No, it's different, look!

966
01:20:46,018 --> 01:20:47,726
That's weird.

967
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:51,351
''Contamination hazard
urban disposal?''

968
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:55,726
This shit's contaminated.

969
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,017
This shit is toxic waste.

970
01:20:59,477 --> 01:21:01,517
Wilson!

971
01:21:03,393 --> 01:21:05,851
This is Wilson's poison dump!

972
01:21:07,727 --> 01:21:10,184
I don't believe it.
Look at all this shit.

973
01:21:10,268 --> 01:21:13,392
They must have been dumping
this stuff down here for years

974
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:17,726
It's got to be Wilson. But what the hell's
the NRC got to do with all this!

975
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,726
Holy shit!

976
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:22,851
C.H.U.D.

977
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:28,226
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir, they're all covered.

978
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:32,059
Start the gas.

979
01:21:34,852 --> 01:21:37,267
What is that?

980
01:21:42,268 --> 01:21:44,351
Cooper. Cooper!

981
01:21:46,352 --> 01:21:48,559
Help! No!

982
01:21:49,435 --> 01:21:51,934
Shh! Shh! Shh!

983
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:54,767
It's okay. It's okay.

984
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:57,351
It's okay. It's alright.

985
01:21:57,435 --> 01:22:00,351
It's okay. Okay.

986
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:09,226
Shit, man!

987
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:12,226
- Noxious gas.
- What?

988
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:15,351
Wait a second!
There's a camera over there.

989
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,892
- There's a camera.
- What?

990
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:23,351
There's a camera.

991
01:22:23,435 --> 01:22:25,851
This is it, man.

992
01:22:40,935 --> 01:22:42,892
Hey! Mayday! Mayday!

993
01:22:42,977 --> 01:22:45,392
Look, hey,
we're trapped down here.

994
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:55,392
There's no audio.

995
01:22:55,477 --> 01:22:57,476
- Where's the headset?
- Let's just get out of here.

996
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,184
There's a headset jack on this thing.
All we have to do is find the headset.

997
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:02,517
Let's get out of here, man.

998
01:23:18,143 --> 01:23:19,559
'Is anybody there?'

999
01:23:19,643 --> 01:23:22,726
- Get Captain Bosch!
- Keep going. Just keep talking.

1000
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,809
- 'Get Captain...'
- Who the hell are you?

1001
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,476
'Hey! Get somebody.'

1002
01:23:30,268 --> 01:23:32,267
'Hey, Captain, this is Sanderson.

1003

phone call from some NRC guy.

1005

1007

'Do you know what that means?'

1008
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:47,726
Help!

1009
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:50,642
Somebody help me!

Help!

Ah!

1013

Ah!

1014
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,517
'Reverend?
This is Bosch. Do you read me?'

1015
01:25:51,602 --> 01:25:53,809
- Yeah, Bosch.
- Where are you?

1016
01:25:53,893 --> 01:25:57,226
I'm here. I'm at that place
where your guys got killed.

1017
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:59,351
- All right, see the side tunnel?
- Yeah.

1018
01:25:59,435 --> 01:26:01,601
'About 100 yards
down that tunnel to the right'

1019
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:05,142
there's a ladder to a manhole.
Be there. I'll open it.

1020
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,434
Yeah, I'll be there.
I got to tell you something, man.

1021
01:26:07,518 --> 01:26:10,767
- It can wait.
- 'No, it can't wait. It's about Wilson.'

1022
01:26:27,143 --> 01:26:29,392
Come on, let's go.

1023
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,142
Man, come on!

1024
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:37,434
Step up the pressure.
We've got to have more gas.

1025
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:57,726
May I have your attention?
This is an emergency!

1026
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:00,267
Who has the key to the truck
parked in the corner

1027
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,309
of Washington
and Dekalb Street?

1028
01:27:02,393 --> 01:27:04,434
There are people
trapped under a manhole.

1029
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:06,642
We need to move the truck
to get them out.

1030
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,226
- Who has the key?
- Right here.

1031
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,809
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1032
01:27:16,893 --> 01:27:18,601
We've already started the gas.

1033
01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:20,892
Those things will be looking
for a way out. It's too risky.

1034
01:27:20,977 --> 01:27:23,434
Too risky?
Oh, for who? For you?

1035
01:27:23,518 --> 01:27:26,559
What, afraid people are gonna
get wind of your filthy little project

1036
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:29,642
and find out who you really are?
Give me the keys goddamn it!

1037
01:27:29,727 --> 01:27:32,184
Maybe the press would like
to hear about this. Hey, you guys!

1038
01:27:32,268 --> 01:27:34,351
Hey, all right! Come on.

1039
01:27:41,935 --> 01:27:44,392
All right, Bosch.
What are you gonna tell them?

1040
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:47,351
For starters, I'll tell them there's more
than leaky canisters down there.

1041
01:27:47,435 --> 01:27:50,351
- So what does that mean?
- You're not from the NRC.

1042
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:52,892
You'll cover for 'em
as long as it's convenient for you

1043
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:56,392
but you don't care about that.
You want them to clean up their mess

1044
01:27:56,477 --> 01:27:58,476
before anybody finds out
what's really going on.

1045
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,726
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1046
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:04,351
I know what C.H.U.D. stands for.
Cannibalistic, my ass!

1047
01:28:04,435 --> 01:28:07,226
Contamination hazard
urban disposal.

1048
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:10,392
You know, you're nothing
but the government garbage man.

1049
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:12,267
You take industrial waste,

1050
01:28:12,352 --> 01:28:15,351
you take toxic slugs
from every research project

1051
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:17,559
and dump it
under the streets of our city.

1052
01:28:17,643 --> 01:28:19,684
- Christ!
- You can't hide it anymore, Wilson.

1053
01:28:19,768 --> 01:28:22,684
Now give me the keys.
I'm gonna get those men out of there.

1054
01:28:22,768 --> 01:28:25,809
- I can't let you do that.
- It's over, Wilson.

1055
01:28:25,893 --> 01:28:28,851
I said, I can't let you do that.

1056
01:28:32,852 --> 01:28:35,142
How are you gonna cover up
killing a cop, huh?

1057
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,351
I don't know. But I can't let
that story get out.

1058
01:28:37,435 --> 01:28:41,101
- You won't shoot me, Wilson.
- I will if I have to.

1059
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,642
Isn't this it?

1060
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,892
Move it! Police! Move it!

1061
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,184
Stop the gas! Who's in charge?

1062
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:48,726
- They've gotta stop the gas.
- Stop it? Why?

1063
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:51,226
My husband's down there.
Who's in charge?

1064
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,934
- Some NRC guy...
- Show me...

1065
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:56,142
- Where is he?
- He just went down there.

1066
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,976
It's jammed.

1067
01:30:24,643 --> 01:30:27,934
- Hey, you guys down there?
- Bosch, hurry!

1068
01:30:28,018 --> 01:30:30,726
I'm here.

1069
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,684
What was that?

1070
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,434
George, look out!

1071
01:31:25,643 --> 01:31:27,392
Bosch.

1072
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:34,392
Come on. Get up! Get up!
He's trying to kill us.

1073
01:31:34,477 --> 01:31:36,642
Get up.

1074
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:40,476
No!

1075
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,392
No!

1076
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:19,142
Nice shot.

1077
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:22,851
Bosch!

1078
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:39,392
Nice shot!
