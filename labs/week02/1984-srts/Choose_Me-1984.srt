1
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,310
Stay by your phone.

2
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,350
Dr. Nancy Love will be up on
KCMY Talk Radio...

3
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,150
with The Love Line.

4
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,190
I recommend that you examine...

5
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,070
the deeper feelings
you have for your wife, Tom.

6
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,990
I don't know, Dr. Love.
She gets pretty wild sometimes.

7
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,150
These wild things she does,
they'll never change.

8
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,070
They may take different forms...

9
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,910
but that woman is who she is
for life.

10
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,070
There's really no mystery to
sex, but there may be to her...

11
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,590
so I really urge you to make
an effort...

12
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,070
and try to be more accepting of
who she is.

13
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,790
- Thank you, Dr. Love.
- Well, thank you for calling.

14
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,950
We have time
for one more caller.

15
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,510
This is The Love Line.

16
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,910
I'm Dr. Nancy Love,
and you're on The Love Line.

17
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,510
- Your name, please.
- Jane.

18
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,590
What would you
like to talk about?

19
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,310
Is Love really your last name?

20
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,390
That's what you want to discuss?

21
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,830
I just think it's great that
nobody knows...

22
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,270
what you look like
and you can...

23
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,510
walk around with a last name
like that.

24
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,350
That's my life, Jane,
and we're talking about yours.

25
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,310
My life's pretty good,
thank you.

26
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,030
I'm stable. I know what I want.

27
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,630
Just...

28
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,750
just have this one teensy
problem.

29
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,910
A love problem.

30
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,830
That's right. A love problem.

31
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,910
And you're deciding whether
or not to make a change.

32
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,590
It's occurred to me.

33
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,990
How long have you been
in this relationship?

34
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,430
Three and a half years.

35
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,030
- How old are you?
- 32.

36
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,190
- And him?
- 45.

37
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,350
- And he's married.
- That's right.

38
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,470
He's married.
Classic stuff, huh?

39
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,310
Well, with the dilemma
you're in, Jane...

40
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,790
we could discuss sexual
attitudes, early childhood...

41
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,270
but the truth is
when you make changes...

42
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,190
you sometimes
have to endure pain.

43
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,870
Is that what you do
with your pain?

44
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,430
We're talking about you.

45
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,310
Have you ever considered
therapy?

46
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,150
You're my therapy.
You're a doctor.

47
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,950
I talk anonymously on the radio.

48
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,910
That's very different
from what you might need.

49
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,270
You're a legitimate doctor,
aren't you... Doctor?

50
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,230
That's what it says on
my credentials.

51
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,550
People invent things
all the time.

52
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,990
Then that would be my problem.

53
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,030
Come on... Dr. Love.

54
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,150
Don't you sometimes get the urge
to go into a bar...

55
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,030
and meet someone and talk about
your life?

56
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,270
Stand by for the news.

57
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,470
We're running out of time.

58
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,190
I'm sorry,
but it's time for the news.

59
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,350
We'll be right back.
Please hold on.

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,470
Thank you, Mr. Chomsky.

61
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,630
Where's she off to this evening?
How about dinner?

62
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,150
I can't, Ralph.

63
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,470
Nancy, you've been here
for six months...

64
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,190
and I don't know whether
you're living with someone...

65
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,670
or married or what.

66
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,270
All I know is you won't go out
to dinner with me.

67
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,110
I'm working, always working.

68
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,550
How about tomorrow night?

69
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,190
Well, is he crazy or what?

70
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,310
We don't use terms like that.

71
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,390
He's just confused
about his personality.

72
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,150
Just got into a little trouble.

73
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,150
Women trouble, right?

74
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,990
Mickey tells lies. That's
basically all that's wrong.

75
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,430
- Hell, everybody lies.
- Precisely.

76
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,230
But you said
he sometimes gets violent.

77
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,430
Frankly, we are understaffed,
and we need the space.

78
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,270
You'll have to take him home.

79
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,910
We're going to need
some more copies.

80
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,710
I made a mistake on this one.
It'll take just a minute to fix.

81
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,830
Hey, Louis.

82
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,950
Here you go. Enjoy.

83
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,390
Thanks.

84
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,030
What can I do for you?

85
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,910
Smirnoff. Shooter, please.
And a Guinness.

86
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,430
With two inches of head.

87
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,230
Sounds good.

88
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,870
You, yes, you.

89
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,350
Listen to this
and tell me what you think.

90
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,430
"I like the way
you wear your hair and smell.

91
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,830
"When you're asleep,
I see all your beauty.

92
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,670
"But we just can't seem to work
this sex thing out."

93
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,030
Well?

94
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,230
Why do you want to know
what I think?

95
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,710
Who else?

96
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,630
You don't want to know
what I think.

97
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,710
I just escaped
from a mental home.

98
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,870
So that makes you an expert.
Tell me.

99
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,830
I think it sucks. You stole it.

100
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,750
I did not! I didn't steal it.

101
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,910
It's what I feel.

102
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,670
I got notebooks
full of what I feel.

103
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,030
Then I think it's great.

104
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,790
You do?

105
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,590
Absolutely.

106
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,390
Now you're lying.

107
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,790
I never lie.

108
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,710
I taught poetry at Yale.

109
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,190
Bullshit.

110
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,430
"No matter who I'm with,
they want to know...

111
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,670
"if I'm still sleeping with you.

112
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,230
"I say that you sleep
while I die a little...

113
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,830
"but I'm not afraid of death.

114
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,030
"At least you get laid
in your coffin."

115
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,270
You weren't even listening.

116
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,470
You want to get laid.

117
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,190
It was just a poem.

118
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,190
Just a thought.

119
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,150
Around 6:30, someone's coming by
to see me...

120
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,590
about moving into my house.

121
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,110
If you're looking for
a roommate...

122
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,590
what's wrong with me?

123
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,230
Female roommate.

124
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,550
- What'll you have?
- Excuse me. I'm looking for Eve.

125
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,230
You found her.

126
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm Ann.

127
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,870
You want something to drink
while we talk?

128
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,870
Scotch, please. Straight.

129
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,550
Why don't we sit over there?

130
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,110
Thank you.

131
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,590
Got it?

132
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,990
It seems like
a pleasant place to work.

133
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,150
I own it.

134
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,950
That's wonderful.

135
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,590
So what about you?
What do you do?

136
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,910
I only work half days, sort of
telephone answering service.

137
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,870
Servicing is very big
these days.

138
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,990
I suppose so.

139
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,550
God, you love to stare at women.

140
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,870
- Old habit.
- Ever been married?

141
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,950
- Sure.
- What happened?

142
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,670
Which time?

143
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,590
So you'll come by
around noon tomorrow?

144
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,470
If that's all right with you.

145
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,030
No problem.

146
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,830
Most of my men are early risers.

147
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,790
Eve, I don't want
to interrupt anything.

148
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,990
You're not interrupting
anything.

149
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,110
Finished that one? History.

150
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,270
Hey, Ace. Smirnoff. Straight.

151
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,030
I'm drunk. How about you?

152
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,110
Never.
Something to do with my blood.

153
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,310
Smirnoff. Neat.
You new in town or what?

154
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,550
No, I'm the same.
Town's different.

155
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,510
Right.

156
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,070
Got any money?

157
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,310
- I can get it.
- I got plenty of money.

158
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,390
So where are you from?

159
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,190
Las Vegas.

160
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,030
Nobody's from Las Vegas.

161
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,470
I am.

162
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,150
So where you headed?

163
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,430
- Las Vegas.
- You're crazy!

164
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,190
That's what they say.

165
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,270
When I go away,
I'm headed for Europe.

166
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,670
I'm learning how
to speak French.

167
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,510
Parlez-vous Français?

168
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,470
I spent six years in Europe.

169
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,750
Yeah? Where?

170
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,670
Berlin. Rome. Moscow.

171
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,430
You been to Russia?

172
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,910
- Twice.
- What for?

173
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,910
I'm not supposed to tell you.

174
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,550
God, you been a lot of places
and done a lot of things.

175
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,270
Just like a dream.

176
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,350
I guess I'm nervous because...
I've always lived alone.

177
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,550
Always?

178
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,310
Never even with a man?

179
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,910
I don't have much success
with men.

180
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,510
I have too much.

181
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,470
The key's under the mat.

182
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,550
I have to be going. I'm sorry.

183
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,470
Thank you.

184
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,430
Looking for a good time?

185
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,790
No, I'm not.

186
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,035
How you doing, soldier?

187
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,355
Need another round?

188
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:24,115
I haven't been a soldier
in a while.

189
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,995
Class dismissed?

190
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:32,595
I used to come in here a lot.
I know this area pretty well.

191
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:36,155
I flew jets down south.
I knew Eve.

192
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:40,595
You mean the original owner?
She died.

193
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,715
Do you know that?

194
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,915
I never knew her.
I just moved out and...

195
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,155
I was walking down the street
one night.

196
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,395
I saw my name on a neon sign...

197
00:15:57,435 --> 00:16:01,315
with a lounge bar for sale
underneath it.

198
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:04,235
I decided I had to take
advantage and go into business.

199
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,995
Figured it had to be better
than marriage.

200
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,155
You were getting married?

201
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:14,115
No way.
I'm never getting married.

202
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,835
You moving?

203
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,155
Photographic equipment.

204
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:25,035
Really?

205
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:29,795
I do portraits.
I've won awards.

206
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:34,555
I see. And you came in here
to find new faces?

207
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,955
I came here to find Eve.

208
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,955
Good night, Eve.

209
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:52,395
Good night, ladies.

210
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,795
That how you saw the sign
that first night?

211
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:04,435
Didn't you know?
All us working girls are pals.

212
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:08,955
You work long hours.

213
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,995
I can say the same about you.

214
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,955
You think I'm working on you.

215
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,715
Part-time work.

216
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:21,315
You smile for a lot of the guys.

217
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:24,675
I like men. I always have.

218
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,755
I was just thinking what it
would be like to kiss you.

219
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,355
And?

220
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:35,275
I wanted to marry you.

221
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:40,715
I've ruined too many marriages
to have one of my own.

222
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,835
You smile for
a lot of the guys...

223
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,235
because you have
a beautiful smile.

224
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:53,235
I can see some guy falling
for your smile alone.

225
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,195
She used to smile
for everyone, too.

226
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,235
How well did you know her?

227
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,955
I knew her.

228
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:15,355
Did you know she shot herself?
Committed suicide over some guy.

229
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,915
Maybe that's what we have
in common besides our name.

230
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:26,955
Men problems.

231
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:28,635
You said this was
a rough neighborhood at night.

232
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,035
You said you wanted someone
to walk you to your car.

233
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:31,995
You said you wanted someone
to walk you to your car.

234
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,715
I did.

235
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:37,395
I came this far because we had
an understanding, didn't we?

236
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,595
- An understanding.
- You said you wanted protection.

237
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:46,115
I'm just trying to be correct
about all this.

238
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,475
You're right,
and you're correct.

239
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,485
I scare you.

240
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,325
I just think
I can make it alone now.

241
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:53,565
What if I wanted to see
more of you privately?

242
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,765
You'd have to really want that.

243
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:02,005
Good night.

244
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:34,685
Hi, Ann. Come on in.

245
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,605
- Good morning.
- What time is it?

246
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,045
- Do you want some coffee?
- Please.

247
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:48,365
Great. Cream and sugar or black?

248
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:51,845
Actually, I'm not going to have
coffee.

249
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,325
I have to go
to the phone company.

250
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,085
Did you want to take
a grand tour?

251
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:05,405
- Maybe later.
- Is that all you brought?

252
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:06,965
Yeah. A mover's coming with
the rest.

253
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,405
It's not much, though.

254
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:16,965
Here's the key, and...

255
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,285
Let's see, I usually leave
for work around 4:00.

256
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:22,365
I get off at 5:00.

257
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,645
That's great. We should get
along just fine.

258
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,925
Let me think.

259
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:34,125
The refrigerator
always needs help, and...

260
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,285
Hot water's always hot.

261
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:40,365
- I shouldn't be long.
- Neither should he.

262
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:51,125
Eve, come here.

263
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:58,485
This is Ernest Greene.

264
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:03,485
- Am I bothering you?
- Nancy?

265
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:05,005
Am I?

266
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:07,925
I've always said you could call
on this line day or night...

267
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,245
if there's a problem.

268
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,525
Now, what is the problem?

269
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,765
I just want to talk with you.

270
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,245
I've moved again.

271
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:24,525
I see. Would you like
to come in to discuss it?

272
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,485
No. Over the phone.

273
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:29,125
You know I'll only do it
over the phone.

274
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,125
Please.
If you can't accept that...

275
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,005
I'll find someone who will.

276
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,805
I'm with another patient now.

277
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:37,365
I can call you
after the session...

278
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,325
No. It's all right. It'll be OK.

279
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,285
I'm sorry I got upset. Sorry.

280
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,245
Jerk.

281
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:58,285
No. Don't try to fight.

282
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,125
Don't tell me that.
I know it's not true.

283
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:05,485
You're lying. You're lying.
You're always lying.

284
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:38,445
Yes, sir?

285
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,205
What time's the next bus
leave for Las Vegas?

286
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,565
- Hi, Babs.
- Hi, Lou.

287
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:45,405
2:38.

288
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,405
How much?

289
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:51,645
$93.48.
That's tax included, one way.

290
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:53,485
Can I go on credit?

291
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:55,605
We'll take a credit card,
if that's what you mean.

292
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,925
All my credit cards and
my money's in Las Vegas.

293
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:01,605
Sorry, sir.

294
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,205
Bum a smoke?

295
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,845
Don't have any matches.

296
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,725
Got a match?

297
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:17,205
Having trouble with that Spatzel
out there?

298
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:18,645
Yeah, friggin' monster.

299
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:21,565
I've been working on that clutch
assembly two whole days.

300
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:24,845
They ain't even made in America.
This ain't working either.

301
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:28,045
They're gonna can my ass
if I don't fix it today.

302
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:29,765
I can fix it.

303
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:32,125
Trick is, you got to rotate
the flywheel just right.

304
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,565
I worked at the plant
in Stuttgart.

305
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,165
I'll fix that thing
in half an hour.

306
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,445
There's 20 bucks in it for you.

307
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:43,645
Let's go.

308
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:47,005
Can I give you the rest later
on that ticket to Las Vegas?

309
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,045
I'm really sorry, sir.
I still can't do it.

310
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,165
Of course you can't.

311
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,005
Got some place
I can change my clothes?

312
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:57,285
There's a rest room in the back.

313
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:13,965
I'd better be going.
I got a lot of errands to run.

314
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,405
Thank you.

315
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:17,165
Listen, if my phone rings,
don't worry about it.

316
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:18,605
I don't mind answering.

317
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,925
That's right.
It's your profession.

318
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,965
What a night I had.

319
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,845
I'm sorry I came by so early.

320
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:31,085
You were on time. I was off.

321
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,845
I can't imagine you off, Eve.

322
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,685
See you.

323
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,925
Is Eve there?

324
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:04,685
- No, she isn't.
- Who is this?

325
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,125
Would you like
to leave a message?

326
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:11,685
There is a message,
but first tell me who this is.

327
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,965
I'm Ann. Eve's new roommate.

328
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:18,045
Roommate?

329
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,485
Can you tell Eve
that Zack called?

330
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,405
That's all, Zack?

331
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:27,725
That isn't all. Tell her
that Pearl knows everything.

332
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:31,085
Will Eve know what that means?

333
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:34,605
I wish she didn't, but she will.

334
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:37,405
Maybe you should
tell her yourself, Zack.

335
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:40,245
Somehow things work out
differently that way.

336
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:42,925
What do you mean
"things work out differently"?

337
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,805
How old are you, Zack?

338
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:49,365
J'ai I'age du temps.

339
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:51,405
He's right there,
you know what I mean?

340
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:55,085
He looks at you, he listens...

341
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:58,685
He's a good lover.

342
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:00,605
Being a good lover's
a distant third...

343
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,005
in that race as far
as I'm concerned.

344
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,485
Do you have other lovers, Diane?

345
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:08,645
That's the reason I called.

346
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:13,285
There's this guy at work.
He got a crush on me.

347
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,045
Last night, I made love with him
for the first time.

348
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,685
Why did you do that?

349
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:25,325
Because something happened,
and it was late and...

350
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:30,125
I wanted a man to hold me.
He's not for me, though.

351
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:33,045
Sometimes I wonder
if there is anyone for me.

352
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,725
I met this other guy yesterday.

353
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:39,645
I swear to God, I almost
fell for him in a minute.

354
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:45,845
Then he came on in a crazy way,
and I got confused.

355
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:47,725
Nancy, stand by
for a station break.

356
00:28:47,765 --> 00:28:48,965
Bullshit.

357
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:52,405
- You think I'm pretty loose.
- No, I don't think that.

358
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,845
I don't judge any of my callers,
Diane...

359
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:57,085
but we have to break
for a commercial.

360
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,285
I think that when
you speak to Dr. Love...

361
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:01,365
you should phrase the call
in something like...

362
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,485
you can't separate
pain from pleasure.

363
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,845
Then she'll be able to get right
to your problem.

364
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:25,405
So... what gives, babe?

365
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:28,885
I'm getting more attention
from the saxophone player.

366
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:30,845
You were in a panic last night.

367
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,645
I thanked you for last night.

368
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,285
Jesus Christ. You call me
at 4:00 in the morning.

369
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,965
Last night you couldn't
live without me...

370
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:40,365
and today
we're fucking strangers?

371
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,005
It'll never happen again.

372
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:45,805
God damn it, I want it to.

373
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:49,045
We are not talking about
this anymore, is that clear?

374
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,805
Good.

375
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:04,805
Yes? What, honey?

376
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,805
Tell me, Eve...

377
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:10,245
why do you suppose
men are drawn to you?

378
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:13,525
Because I don't ask
dumb questions.

379
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,365
Two inches of head, right?

380
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:30,925
Right. And a Smirnoff shooter.

381
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,685
You like her, don't you?

382
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,445
Could be.

383
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:47,365
How come?

384
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:49,405
Her name reminds me of someone.

385
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:51,005
Just her name?

386
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:55,405
Different face, different
personality, same name.

387
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:57,285
What happened to the other one?

388
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:59,205
We were supposed to get married.

389
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:00,685
Married again?

390
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:04,045
She would have been the first.
I asked her twice.

391
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,045
So what happened?

392
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:09,325
I was in the Air Force...
jet pilot.

393
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:10,925
Met her in a bar.

394
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,885
Walked her to her car,
kissed her...

395
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:15,965
asked her to marry me.

396
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:19,885
She met another guy
a week before the wedding.

397
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,245
So what did you do?

398
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:26,525
What did I do?
I became a mechanic...

399
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:29,165
a spy, gambler, madman.

400
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,725
Don't forget photog...

401
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,805
Photographer.

402
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:36,365
I'll be right back.
Don't go away, OK?

403
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,405
Wouldn't think of it.

404
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,645
Get home safely last night?

405
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,285
Yeah. Fine.

406
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,645
Everything worked out fine.

407
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,965
Well?

408
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,205
Well, what?

409
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:07,245
When can I see you again?

410
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:13,045
You said I had to really
want that, and I really do.

411
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:14,965
It's meant to be, right?

412
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:24,085
I could give you
her phone number and address.

413
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:27,925
- My old man sees her sometimes.
- Your father?

414
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:32,125
He's old enough to be my father,
but he's my husband.

415
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:36,525
We're separated. He doesn't
go over there all the time...

416
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:39,085
just when he thinks
I'm not looking.

417
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,125
So I come in here
to try and catch him.

418
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:44,205
She doesn't know who I am.

419
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,485
You really a gambler?

420
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:51,405
Sometimes.

421
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:55,725
There's a big game
a few blocks from my house.

422
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,845
Real serious stuff.

423
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:00,645
I could drop you there
on my way home.

424
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,965
Let's go.

425
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,445
Night, Eve.

426
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,430
Can I ask you something?

427
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,350
You just did.

428
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,110
What I mean is...

429
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,350
what did you do about the man
who stole your woman?

430
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,310
I killed him.

431
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,030
Liar.

432
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,310
How did you kill him?

433
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,430
Shot him with his own gun.
Self-defense.

434
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,870
That's why my wife divorced me.
My second wife.

435
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,150
And then you went to Russia
to forget.

436
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,830
No. That was before.

437
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,830
That's why my wife divorced me.
My first wife.

438
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,110
She heard I was brainwashed.

439
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,790
Wow! Did it hurt?

440
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,030
- What?
- The divorce.

441
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,430
- They always hurt.
- That's what I've heard.

442
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,190
See the buzzer by the door?

443
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,910
Push it and tell them Whitey
said it was all right.

444
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,430
Right. Thanks.

445
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,470
Are you really a photographer?

446
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,190
Six covers of Newsweek,
three of Esquire.

447
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,790
Wow. That's what I need...
a good job.

448
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,310
You know what my favorite job
would be of all time?

449
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,590
To be the radio talk lady...
Dr. Nancy Love.

450
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,830
Ever listen to her?

451
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,350
I don't listen to radio talk.

452
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,270
You should,
because she's real smart.

453
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,110
Just think, having a job where
you talk on the phone all day...

454
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,470
and get paid for it.
Women trust her.

455
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,110
Men fantasize about her.
What a life.

456
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,990
I hear she's tall and blonde.

457
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,070
Would you like
to take my picture?

458
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,790
I could marry you.

459
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,790
God, you're crazy...

460
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,470
but the key's
still under the mat.

461
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,910
This is Eve's phone number
and address.

462
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,510
I forgot to give it to you.

463
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,750
What a guy.

464
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,545
Why did you come here, Zack?

465
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:52,425
I had to see you.
I called your house.

466
00:36:57,745 --> 00:37:00,745
I spoke to your new
roommate... Ann.

467
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,785
What?

468
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:09,105
She's a very perceptive woman.
Clarified a few things for me.

469
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:12,345
She did what?

470
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:15,465
Don't worry. They're all good.

471
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,305
But we must talk.

472
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:21,585
I want to see you. Tonight.

473
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:31,145
We've been through this
too many times before.

474
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,785
Listen, Eve...

475
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:39,025
Ann told me something
that really helped...

476
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:41,105
but we must talk.

477
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:54,345
Come back around 2:00.
We'll talk.

478
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:20,385
Max?

479
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,185
Daddy's here.

480
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:23,625
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

481
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:26,345
Good. The moon is in Pluto.

482
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:39,305
My throat is so sore.
It is to you, Zack.

483
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:42,825
Five.

484
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:50,985
Bump five.

485
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:07,785
My judgment goes kaput, ja?

486
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:12,985
Well, this is the last card,
gentlemen.

487
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:14,425
Got any more smokes?

488
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,265
Zigarette, bitte.

489
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:27,505
Ten.

490
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,265
Bump ten.

491
00:39:35,145 --> 00:39:36,905
Raise you twenty.

492
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:41,785
Bump 20.

493
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,745
That hole must be magic.

494
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:48,145
Cost you twenty more
to find out.

495
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:55,985
Who'd you say told you about
this place, mister?

496
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:57,825
I didn't.

497
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,105
Didn't think you did.

498
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,105
Thirty...

499
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:11,865
six.

500
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:15,025
Max?

501
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:20,185
No, not with the moon in Pluto.

502
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:27,105
Call it a day.
I got things to do now.

503
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:32,465
Did I tell you
I don't like your face, mister?

504
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:34,385
Did you get that impression?

505
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:35,905
I hadn't noticed.

506
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:45,145
Attention
qu'est-ce que tu dis, eh?

507
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:47,425
Les murs ont des oreilles.

508
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:53,945
I don't want to see you
around, mister.

509
00:40:57,785 --> 00:40:59,705
Madame X.

510
00:41:09,545 --> 00:41:12,105
Zigarette, mein freund?

511
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,465
Next time, Fritz.

512
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:22,145
Ciao.

513
00:41:36,305 --> 00:41:39,945
Auf wiedersehen.
Another game, gentlemen?

514
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:59,985
Nancy, this is Ernest Greene.
You never called back.

515
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,705
I'm having dinner with someone.

516
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:07,385
You had me worried.

517
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,785
I'm fine. I'm working.

518
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:12,105
There's a sound in your voice,
Nancy.

519
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,625
I'm fine.

520
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,945
You don't sound fine.
Are you on any medication?

521
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:25,665
I'm beginning to understand
myself better now...

522
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:29,345
entering a more knowing phase.

523
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:34,505
And I know that I remain
my own worst enemy.

524
00:42:34,545 --> 00:42:38,345
But I also know
that I am my own savior...

525
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:42,945
because freedom
means responsibility.

526
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:45,185
You're not making any sense.

527
00:42:45,225 --> 00:42:49,225
And believe me,
I also know how easily...

528
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:51,905
desire can be converted to deed.

529
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,505
Even when I close my eyes...

530
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:56,825
I have to be careful
of what I dream and how.

531
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:02,465
All right, Nancy.
It's happening again.

532
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:04,385
I want to see you first thing
in the morning.

533
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:06,065
I don't care
what your schedule is.

534
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:09,145
I have to go. I wouldn't want
to be rude to my guest.

535
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:11,625
Thanks for your concern.
I'll call tomorrow.

536
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:13,585
Nancy, listen to me.
Don't hang up...

537
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,945
All I was asking was for
some time to think about it.

538
00:43:55,945 --> 00:43:59,705
You're married, but not to me.

539
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:01,705
You don't want to get married.

540
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:07,025
That's not the point.

541
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,505
Stop it.

542
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,185
What are you doing here?

543
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:11,785
This is my friend Mickey.

544
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:15,265
He's a photographer,
and I met him at Eve's.

545
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:17,705
Don't fight.
Please don't fight, Zack.

546
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:21,625
Stop it, you guys!
Don't! Don't fight!

547
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:27,465
- Flowers!
- Your favorites.

548
00:48:32,425 --> 00:48:35,905
Please, be careful.
He said he'd killed a man.

549
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:37,505
You're wearing our wedding ring.

550
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:40,465
The money.

551
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,505
I'm gonna get it
one way or another.

552
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:47,865
Don't you know about fucking
somebody else's wife, pervert.

553
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:56,385
And then photographing
what you did.

554
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,860
Don't shoot, Zack.

555
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,700
You want to put
that gun away, friend.

556
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,620
You can do it with the ladies
on Adams Street...

557
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,220
but not with my wife.

558
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,340
Leave him alone, Zack.
He didn't know we were married.

559
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,620
I want my money.

560
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,900
You're not going to shoot me.

561
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,740
We both know
you can't do it here.

562
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,820
You're a dead man, pervert.

563
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,980
I love my flowers,
and I love you.

564
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:42,347
Tu m'as manqué, ma petite.

565
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,473
C'était triste sans toi.

566
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,820
Will you come home around 3:00,
like last night?

567
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,380
Like last night, and the next...

568
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,020
and hopefully
the one after that.

569
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,380
- Were you ever married?
- Nope, and I don't plan to be.

570
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,820
May I ask why?

571
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,300
Sure, you can,
and I'll tell you why, Ann.

572
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,180
Because I wouldn't want
my marriage to fail.

573
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,980
One way or another they all do.

574
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,660
Maybe not with the right man.

575
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,860
All my men are the right man.

576
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,780
You talked to one yesterday.
What's your opinion?

577
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,220
You're angry, and I'm sorry.

578
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,180
No, I'm not.

579
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,820
I should probably thank you.

580
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,740
It was the sweetest
Zack's been to me in months.

581
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,140
I'll try to be more quiet
when I come in tonight.

582
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,060
No problem.
I'd just gone to bed myself.

583
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,540
I was at a dinner party.

584
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,940
Yeah? Did you get lucky?

585
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,260
Lucky? I think so. Very lucky.

586
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,540
This is Mickey.

587
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,860
Does it bother you
that I called?

588
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,500
Would it bother you
if I came over?

589
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,060
I need a place to lie down
for a while.

590
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,500
Look, I'm just tired,
that's all.

591
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,380
You don't even have
to talk to me.

592
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,260
Great. I'll be there
in half an hour.

593
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,140
Is Eve around?

594
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,060
That's blood.

595
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,020
You know when she'll be back?

596
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,460
3:00 in the morning.

597
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,460
How did you know I was hungry?

598
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,220
It was in your eyes.

599
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,500
It's also in my stomach.

600
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,140
Less than in your eyes.

601
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,380
What's your name?

602
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,180
What's yours?

603
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,860
I remember seeing you
at Eve's place.

604
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,460
Were you there?

605
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,780
What's your name?

606
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,020
Ann.

607
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,780
Mickey.

608
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Have you known Eve long?

609
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,500
I just moved in here.

610
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,660
It's nice.

611
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,980
Eve's very nice,
don't you think?

612
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,100
Yes. I like her.

613
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,460
I do, too.

614
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,780
There's a strength about her.
Very solid.

615
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,100
I'm impressed. I truly am.

616
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,060
I think she's a blink away
from going off.

617
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,220
I've seen it before.

618
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,340
No, not at all.
I'm a good judge of people.

619
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,180
She's one of
the more stable ones.

620
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,580
I remember you now.

621
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,020
What do you do, Ann?

622
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,980
I operate
a telephone answering service.

623
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,660
You like to talk on the phone.

624
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:06,580
It's comfortable for me.
I learn a lot on the phone.

625
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,420
Not having to deal with the
complexities of people's faces.

626
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,980
Getting straight answers
if I ask straight questions.

627
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,940
I mean, when I ask questions,
that is.

628
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,740
Someone told me last night...

629
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,180
they thought the best job
of all time...

630
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:28,780
would be to talk on the phone
all day long... radio talk.

631
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,220
What did you say?

632
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,500
They had to be
some radio doctor...

633
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,140
named Norma Love or
Nancy Love or something.

634
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,580
Yeah, Nancy Love.

635
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,180
You don't know
who Nancy Love is?

636
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,940
Truthfully?

637
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,660
Always.

638
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,780
She's quite popular, you know.
That's why I asked you.

639
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,180
- Smart?
- Her?

640
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,700
Extremely smart.

641
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,940
She helps a great deal
of people.

642
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,860
Good.

643
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,060
But there's a price involved.

644
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,940
She can help others,
but not herself.

645
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,540
She gives advice to
the lovelorn every day...

646
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,820
but she's never been in love
herself.

647
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,420
Or so I've heard.

648
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
Rough.

649
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,180
Some people worship her.

650
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,940
Can you imagine how hard
that must be to live with?

651
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,180
Knowing that anything
you ever say to anyone...

652
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,020
will count heavily,
be acted upon...

653
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,460
whether you're right or wrong.

654
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,180
There's tremendous
responsibility in that.

655
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:39,180
She'd have to live
a life of secrecy...

656
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,700
to avoid that kind of pressure.

657
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,220
Even then,
she'd have to be careful...

658
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,020
of listening to herself,
you know?

659
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:51,780
And she must wonder about
her own life experiences.

660
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,980
She must have difficulty
touching life...

661
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,700
because she gives so much of
herself to others.

662
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,540
She spends so much of her time
absorbing others.

663
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,540
People really listen
to that shit?

664
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,500
Yes, they do. Believe me.
I've heard her show before.

665
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,940
I can tell.

666
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,860
Very complex person.

667
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:20,100
I would imagine very few people
understand her.

668
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:26,940
She must do
some eccentric things...

669
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,420
that have become quite natural
to her, you know?

670
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,820
Half in, half out of reality.

671
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,580
Yeah. Very complex.

672
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,020
Men fantasize about her,
women trust her.

673
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,900
You're right.
I think that's true.

674
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,860
How long have you known Eve?

675
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,620
You already asked me that.

676
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,500
Then you said she was solid,
and I said she was scared.

677
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,740
Then you talked
about Norma Love.

678
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,540
Nancy Love. Scared of what?

679
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,220
What else? Herself.

680
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,980
Yeah. Interesting.
You must be close.

681
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,780
I met her the day
you were there.

682
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,140
And she gave you
her phone number and address?

683
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,780
She didn't give them to me.

684
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,820
I kissed her, too.
I wanted to kiss her more.

685
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,460
She wouldn't let you?

686
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,780
We ran out of time, that's all.

687
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,980
So you've come here
for more time.

688
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,540
I came here to get some rest,
get cleaned up, food.

689
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,900
I see, but kissing
would come later.

690
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,860
It's up to you.

691
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,460
I beg your pardon.

692
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,340
No, you don't.

693
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,060
What are you doing?

694
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,980
The same thing you are.

695
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,940
No, you're mistaken.

696
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,460
I need a woman right now.

697
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,020
- I can tell.
- Can you use a man?

698
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:34,180
No, I don't. I can't.
It's been...

699
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,620
Yeah. I thought so.

700
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,100
Which room's yours?

701
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,860
This is silly. Really silly.
I know it's the wine.

702
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,100
It's blood, not wine.

703
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,020
Marry me.

704
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,740
I'm serious.

705
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,500
We don't know each other.

706
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,660
What did we just do,
become strangers?

707
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:05,660
We can take the bus to Vegas.
I can get money there.

708
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,260
I have to go to work.

709
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,820
Let someone else answer
the phone. Marry me.

710
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,580
You may never get
as good an offer.

711
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,500
I've been engaged three times.
Married two of those...

712
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,220
colonel's daughter and
a teacher's assistant.

713
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,460
I loved them both.
I'd still be married...

714
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,420
if something hadn't
happened each time.

715
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,220
So what happened?

716
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,780
What didn't? A little foreign
intrigue with one...

717
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,380
domestic crime with the other.

718
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,140
They were both forced
to divorce me. I understood.

719
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,060
Got nothing to do
with you and me.

720
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,300
You came over here
expecting Eve.

721
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,740
I might have married her,
but she wasn't home.

722
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,180
You're impossible.

723
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,580
- You mean crazy?
- I didn't say that.

724
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,060
I hear it enough.

725
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,820
You think I'm crazy?

726
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,660
I can give you a few pointers.

727
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,580
I have to go to work.

728
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,940
Forget work.
I can get money in Vegas.

729
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,980
You'll never have to work again.
Marry me, damn it.

730
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,340
You can't go around asking
everyone you kiss to marry you.

731
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,260
Why not?

732
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,740
I only kiss women I'd marry.

733
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,660
And once I'm married to them,
I never cheat.

734
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,740
That's the way it is with me.
My wives own me.

735
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,740
It's everybody else
that breaks you up...

736
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,380
governments, cops, hospitals.

737
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,540
It's crazy.
I know it's the wine...

738
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,300
and you know, I'm leaving.

739
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,740
And I think
you should leave, too.

740
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,180
So you're not coming to Vegas
with me?

741
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,060
Pick up some dough,
get married, start something.

742
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,540
You're not serious, Mickey.

743
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,260
Even if you were, I can't.

744
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,140
I am serious. I told you.

745
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,540
So give me one good reason.

746
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,420
And don't say because
we don't know each other.

747
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,260
I'm not...

748
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,900
You see,
other people's problems...

749
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:16,060
Your best reason.

750
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,220
I've never loved anyone.

751
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:26,660
I don't think I can.

752
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:35,060
I think you just don't know
enough about it.

753
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,740
I could teach you that, too.

754
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,780
How to be crazy,
how to be in love.

755
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,820
Please go now.

756
01:06:53,845 --> 01:06:55,405
Dr. Love doesn't believe...

757
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,485
that sex is the most important
thing in a relationship, Stella.

758
01:06:58,525 --> 01:07:02,085
Have you figured out why your
husband sees other women...

759
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,605
if he says he loves you?

760
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,605
People have
to cultivate each other.

761
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:09,525
He loves sex,
and he loves to mess around.

762
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:13,565
- He does?
- Yeah, he does.

763
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:15,405
You knew that about him
when you married him.

764
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:18,645
That's why I married him.
Sex is all we had in common.

765
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:21,845
He's twice my age,
and it was great...

766
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:27,285
but then we started talking,
and it stopped working.

767
01:07:27,325 --> 01:07:32,125
I love him. I really do,
even though he roughs me up.

768
01:07:32,165 --> 01:07:34,725
At least he cares enough
to do it.

769
01:07:36,245 --> 01:07:39,445
Dr. Love, I need your help.

770
01:07:39,485 --> 01:07:41,925
I'm trying to help you, Rita.

771
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:45,005
Do you know what it is when you
feel something for somebody...

772
01:07:45,045 --> 01:07:46,605
and you don't know what it is...

773
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,205
because if you knew
what it was...

774
01:07:48,245 --> 01:07:50,085
you wouldn't feel it anymore?

775
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:54,285
It sort of happens,
and then it goes away.

776
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:57,045
Maybe it's just not one man.

777
01:07:57,085 --> 01:08:01,445
Maybe it's a feeling
you have for all men.

778
01:08:01,525 --> 01:08:06,405
Sex, like everything else,
is largely a mystery.

779
01:08:06,445 --> 01:08:09,085
There's no such thing
as normal sex.

780
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:12,805
Normal sex
is a matter of statistics.

781
01:08:12,845 --> 01:08:14,765
What may be normal
for the vast majority...

782
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:18,245
is no criterion of behavior
for the exceptional person.

783
01:08:18,285 --> 01:08:19,685
But I am exceptional.

784
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:23,165
Throughout history, individuals
of the first rank...

785
01:08:23,205 --> 01:08:26,773
would never have produced had
they not been immersed in sex...

786
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:29,015
and spontaneous sexual behavior.

787
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:33,255
I mean that uncontrollable
impulse...

788
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:35,375
that shakes you
to your very foundation...

789
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:38,375
that makes your nerve ends
tickle and your head spin...

790
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,295
and that makes
you feel like jelly.

791
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:43,295
You may think it's wine, Rita,
but it's not, it's blood...

792
01:08:43,335 --> 01:08:46,295
and there's nothing wrong
with that feeling.

793
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:49,495
We all need to get it.
We all need it.

794
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:53,215
There's nothing wrong with it!

795
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:55,015
But I know about all that.

796
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:56,535
Nancy, stand by
for a station break.

797
01:08:56,575 --> 01:09:00,055
I'm sorry, Rita, we're going
for a station identification.

798
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:02,975
She's just sensational. God!

799
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,415
Don't go away. We'll be back...

800
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:06,335
with more of Dr. Nancy Love
and The Love Line...

801
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,935
right here on KCMY Talk Radio.

802
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:10,575
Bradshaw, cue the I.D.

803
01:10:08,415 --> 01:10:11,055
- Feel OK?
- What?

804
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:14,575
I said, are you feeling
all right?

805
01:10:14,615 --> 01:10:17,055
I got to make a phone call.

806
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:18,895
I know Dr. Love is very
concerned...

807
01:10:18,935 --> 01:10:20,335
about emotional fulfillment...

808
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,815
but she's also been
concerned these days...

809
01:10:22,855 --> 01:10:25,775
with the necessity
for sexual fulfillment.

810
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,295
Yet you're still drawn to her?

811
01:10:27,335 --> 01:10:29,575
She'll be on with you
in about 20 minutes...

812
01:10:29,615 --> 01:10:31,015
after the next call.

813
01:10:31,055 --> 01:10:33,495
- I don't know.
- It's a long call, yeah.

814
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:37,115
I just met him.
We've only talked a few times...

815
01:10:37,116 --> 01:10:38,680
but I'm attracted to him.

816
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,120
I think about him.

817
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,920
Does it bother you that you
could be attracted...

818
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,480
to someone you hardly know?

819
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,760
It bothers me more that I might
not be able to see him again.

820
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Maybe what concerns me
is that I'm not sure...

821
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,600
I'm able to give myself
to anyone.

822
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,520
Then along comes this guy
who could be the right type...

823
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,520
and I play hard to get.

824
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,520
I don't know.

825
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,960
Maybe I should've given in
to a few things.

826
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,160
You mean sexual things?

827
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,600
There she goes again.

828
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,600
Sex? Are you kidding?

829
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,760
I wrote the book on sex.
I'm a prisoner of it.

830
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,600
Hell, I'm a victim of it.
I know all about that feeling...

831
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,120
you get in your belly
when a man says he wants you.

832
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,440
Even if I know he's lying,
I still get that feeling.

833
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,600
I'm conditioned now.

834
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,040
I understand, Karen.

835
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,680
Do you? Then what do I do,
if you understand?

836
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,160
What in the hell
should I be doing?

837
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,680
I'm not sure that I know what
you're after.

838
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,480
I mean, I'm not sure that...

839
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,200
you can do things like that
on the spur of the moment.

840
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,440
You mean fall for some guy
or resist him?

841
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:07,120
Giving in. No, giving in,
either to him or to yourself.

842
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,920
And yet, there's something
so thrilling about giving in.

843
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,840
Don't you think, Karen?

844
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,880
I thought that was what was
wrong with me.

845
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,240
I trusted the moment too much.

846
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,040
That's why I never got married.
I know that much about myself.

847
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,320
There'd always be another moment
with another man.

848
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,200
This man we're talking about...

849
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,520
Where is he now?
Can you talk to him now?

850
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,320
No. I may never see him again.

851
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,840
Can't you reach him?
Didn't he call you?

852
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,640
No, he didn't call me.
He doesn't have my number.

853
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,360
I thought he called.

854
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,960
Now you said he asked you
to marry him.

855
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,040
No. He was only joking.

856
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,560
Look, what I'm trying to tell
you is that I don't think...

857
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,680
I can make marriage
last with anyone.

858
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,000
If you can't see him,
what will you do?

859
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:08,360
Won't kill me.
Maybe it wasn't even him.

860
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,400
Maybe it was just the thrill
of it, like you said.

861
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,320
Yes. The thrill.

862
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,080
He sure seemed OK, though.

863
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,480
Honest, somehow.

864
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,640
Somehow it made sense
in a funny way.

865
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,960
We didn't even talk that much.

866
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,520
Like he said,
sex doesn't make you strangers.

867
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,920
We didn't have sex.

868
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,880
I thought you said
you made love with him.

869
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:48,400
No. He kissed me. Once.

870
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,200
It was very first kiss-like,
you know what I mean?

871
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,800
It's a wonderful feeling.
I just love that feeling.

872
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,600
Karen, what would you think
of a man...

873
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,840
who'd kiss only women
he'd marry?

874
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,080
I never met a man like that,
although you know what?

875
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,440
There is a little bit of that
in this guy.

876
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,400
Don't you think
she's going overboard?

877
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,640
Come on, just answer your calls.
I know what that woman needs...

878
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,680
and I'd like to give it to her.

879
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,480
We have to break for the news.
I've enjoyed talking with you.

880
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,480
I hope we can do that again.
I mean that.

881
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,720
You never know, Dr. Love.

882
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,280
And I hope you find that man
again.

883
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,720
You're listening to KCMY...

884
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,200
the home of Dr. Nancy Love
and The Love Line...

885
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,800
here on 97 Talk Radio.

886
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,840
That's quite a show, Nancy.
Very provocative.

887
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,480
Sun went down
about four hours ago.

888
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,040
Jesus Christ. Who gave you that?

889
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,880
You know this guy.
He comes in here a lot.

890
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,320
What's his name?

891
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,120
What difference does it make
what his name is?

892
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,360
Look, what are you getting
so upset with me about?

893
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,120
You know him, and he's mine.
He can get dangerous...

894
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,600
but it's nothing like me
if you don't stop seeing him.

895
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,000
Why don't you tell him that?

896
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,880
Because I'm telling you,
Eve, woman to woman.

897
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,360
Leave him alone.

898
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,120
Hey, how's it going?

899
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,160
You know anything about
Spatzel master cylinders?

900
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,320
There's 20 bucks in it for you.

901
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,160
I need 93.48, including tax.

902
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,840
What are you trying to do,
put the squeeze on me?

903
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,160
Look, I could afford maybe 50?

904
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,280
Yeah, OK. 50.

905
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,840
Did you really work over there
in that factory in Germany?

906
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,720
- Jawohl.
- How'd you manage that?

907
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,840
I was doing intelligence work
for the Air Force...

908
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,000
following a connection
out of East Berlin.

909
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,440
Ultimately,
it took me to Moscow...

910
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,280
where I was arrested
by the KGB...

911
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,840
and the CIA had to trade for me.

912
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,320
Sorry I asked. Good night, Babs.

913
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,200
Good night, Lou.

914
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,040
I'll walk you to your car.

915
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,400
I'm tired, Bill.

916
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
I said walk.

917
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,120
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

918
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,360
I'm not gonna always be here,
you know that?

919
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,440
Nobody's always here.

920
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,520
Your choice.

921
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,640
Nope. I think it's beyond me.

922
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,160
It wasn't beyond you to get your
ass off the street corner...

923
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,600
into a place of your own,
was it?

924
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,880
How dare you talk to me
like that?

925
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,520
I want you.

926
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,800
Trying to scare me?

927
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,480
What are you doing here?

928
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,160
I just didn't want
to go into the lounge.

929
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,200
But I had to see you.

930
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,600
Please, get out of my car.
I want to go home.

931
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,440
Home. Right.
Listen, about that...

932
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,880
Don't touch me!

933
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,240
Look, I've seen
some of your handiwork.

934
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,640
Now, there's a gun in this car,
OK?

935
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,600
A gun, huh?

936
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,320
Why did you do that to her?

937
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:35,080
I didn't do anything to her.
We did something together.

938
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,520
It happened. It's over.

939
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,800
I thought I was through
getting involved...

940
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,800
with men who are trouble.

941
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,800
Falling in love on a look.

942
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,600
I can't look at you.

943
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,760
You have perfection about you.

944
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,400
Oh, brother.

945
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,880
Perfection. Me.

946
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,640
Your eyes have music.

947
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,640
Your heart's the best part
of your body.

948
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,920
And when you move...

949
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,440
every man, woman, and child
is forced to watch.

950
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,960
You really can make it up.
I'll give you that much.

951
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,800
I'm an expert.
I make everything up.

952
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,200
I'm a pathological liar.

953
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,200
That's why they locked me up
in a mental home.

954
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,400
I make everything up...
except this.

955
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,960
Why am I so privileged?

956
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,320
Because your name reminds me of
a time when I was a lot happier.

957
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:13,000
And I came here looking for...
some of that time.

958
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,840
And there you were
under the blinking sign.

959
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,280
And now I get
this strange feeling...

960
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,480
that it's all part of some plan,
so why fight it?

961
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,720
I want you, Eve.
I want you to want me.

962
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,880
Sure, there might be
someone else...

963
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,600
that'd fit the bill
for either one of us...

964
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,800
but we're here now, they're not.

965
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,720
And there isn't as much time
as there used to be.

966
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,240
So I just want to go home
to Vegas...

967
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,920
pick up a few things for
the future... yours and mine.

968
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,760
I want to marry you, Eve.

969
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,280
I got this thing about marriage.

970
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,680
You really are out of your mind.

971
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,920
And you're not?

972
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,840
So tell me who isn't out of
their goddamn mind.

973
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,400
Most marriages don't last,
you know.

974
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,560
Probably because
they start out like this.

975
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,160
Is that a "yes"?

976
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:39,800
I'm not going to marry anybody.
OK?

977
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,800
God!

978
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,880
Zack! What the hell...

979
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,320
Stay out of this.

980
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,880
Every time I see you,
I feel bad.

981
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,640
You're messing up my life,
pervert.

982
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,600
I was thinking the same thing
about you.

983
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,040
Zack, what are you...
Jesus Christ!

984
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,960
This guy's fucking up
everything I got.

985
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,120
My money, you, my wife.

986
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,840
- Your wife?
- He's full of shit.

987
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,640
Listen to this.
First he sleeps with her.

988
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,120
I understand. I'm French.

989
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:30,840
But then he's taking nude
pictures of her when I walk in.

990
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,640
The guy's a pervert.

991
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,720
It's my duty as a citizen
to eliminate him.

992
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,640
He broke my nose!

993
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,240
Are you all right?

994
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,440
Fine. Thanks. I'm just thirsty.

995
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,440
I heard your car arrive.
I hope you don't mind.

996
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,680
I couldn't sleep.
I was hoping we could talk.

997
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,640
I don't much feel like talking.

998
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,960
I understand.
Maybe you'll listen.

999
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,840
Listening I can do, Ann.

1000
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,360
You really don't know
that much about me, Eve.

1001
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,320
For instance, my name isn't Ann.

1002
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:37,160
And I have lived with people
before, but it was always...

1003
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,040
like research.

1004
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,680
Maybe I should listen to this
in the morning.

1005
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,320
I've had a rough night.

1006
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,200
It shouldn't wait until morning.

1007
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,440
It concerns Mickey,
and I want to clear that up.

1008
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,680
How do you know about Mickey?

1009
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,080
He was over here today.
Looking for you.

1010
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,760
What?

1011
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,120
I'm a very complicated person...

1012
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,560
not all of which
I can explain to you now.

1013
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,920
Look, I don't want to hear about
any of this, Ann...

1014
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,880
or whatever your name is.
I don't think I could take it.

1015
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,760
Mickey said that you two
had just met each other.

1016
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,840
I know that played an
important part in my behavior.

1017
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,960
Look...
I don't even know this man.

1018
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,760
From my point of view,
I'm sure it's just sexual.

1019
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,160
I've been with men before...

1020
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,160
but it was always some sort of
planned event.

1021
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,440
No matter how attached
I'd become to a man's sex...

1022
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,160
I was always more interested
in the person who owned it.

1023
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,040
But...

1024
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,120
this is new for me.

1025
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,400
This is a major breakthrough.

1026
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:15,960
From Mickey,
I learned that, perhaps...

1027
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
when a man enters your life
through your sex...

1028
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,520
it might just be as good a way
as any.

1029
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,600
Isn't that marvelous? All along
I'm thinking it's the wine.

1030
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,880
Isn't that marvelous? All along
I'm thinking it's the wine.

1031
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,360
And, Eve, seeing how you
admit...

1032
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,040
that you don't really know him
all that well...

1033
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,200
I'm wondering
if we might share him.

1034
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:48,730
Are you telling me that Mickey
found out where I lived...

1035
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:53,850
and that he came here and that
you were home...

1036
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:56,290
and that you fucked him?

1037
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:05,690
He said you barely knew each
other.

1038
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,810
Eve, you just said that
yourself.

1039
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:12,090
And he was quite taken with me.
As a matter of fact...

1040
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:15,930
as strange as it sounds,
he asked me to marry him.

1041
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,290
Now, it was amusing,
but most interesting.

1042
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,890
At least part of him
was serious.

1043
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,090
I got excited. I admit it.

1044
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:24,050
You would have done
the same, Eve.

1045
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:28,330
And for a while,
I thought it was simply...

1046
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,490
sensual pleasure, you see.

1047
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:33,890
I even said that on the radi...
at work this afternoon.

1048
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:35,570
But now it's evolving
even further.

1049
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:37,290
It's all very exciting
because it'll have...

1050
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,930
a tremendous impact
on a great number of people.

1051
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,570
I don't want
to get into all this.

1052
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:46,570
I'm sorry about it,
but knowing all the facts...

1053
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:48,050
and under the circumstances...

1054
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:50,250
I don't think that I did
something all that wrong.

1055
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,810
After all, it's not as if you
owned the man.

1056
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,450
No. I don't own him.

1057
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:02,250
I don't own any man,
and I never have...

1058
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,010
and no man owns me.

1059
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:15,690
I used to think
I wanted to own this house.

1060
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,530
Now I don't care.

1061
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,130
Why don't you keep it?

1062
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,930
You seem to be much more
comfortable here than I do.

1063
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,970
Why don't you
just keep the house...

1064
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,610
and all the men I've collected?

1065
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:34,210
You're not listening, Eve!

1066
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:38,090
I just want to help.

1067
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:48,730
Ann? Is that you?

1068
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:52,210
No. I mean, yes. It's me.
Who's this?

1069
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,410
I miss you.

1070
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:02,570
You're the first person in years
who's understood me.

1071
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:09,170
You don't have to say anything.

1072
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,410
Thanks, soldier.

1073
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:46,970
How about you? Need anything?

1074
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:49,530
You don't want to kiss me.

1075
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:51,930
It won't cost you much
to find out.

1076
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,450
I got ten bucks.

1077
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:58,690
You got a car.

1078
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:02,530
Forget it, soldier.
I don't do it in cars.

1079
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:09,130
I'll give you the ten to take me
to the end of Garden Street.

1080
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,490
That's blood again
on your shirt.

1081
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,930
Where is she?

1082
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,370
I need to see Eve.

1083
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,770
I told her about us.

1084
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:21,170
What did she say?

1085
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,610
It was very helpful.

1086
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:29,010
She said she didn't own anybody.
You sorry I told her?

1087
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,730
Well, you can't lie.

1088
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,570
You sorry it's me?

1089
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,170
She has my suitcase in her car.

1090
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:43,010
Right. I remember that suitcase.

1091
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,130
You!

1092
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,610
Please stop it, both of you.

1093
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:13,210
Mickey, I know the man.

1094
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,770
Put the gun down.
I'm telling you I know him.

1095
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:33,090
I'm going to kill
the son of a bitch. Get up!

1096
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:35,530
Don't you fucking move.

1097
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,730
You don't think I'd do it,
do you?

1098
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,810
I've done it before,
right in this town.

1099
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:41,890
It was just like this...
him or me.

1100
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:44,130
Go ahead, pervert. Shoot me.

1101
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:46,530
He doesn't mean it.
Zack's a very caring person.

1102
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,130
The guy's a goddamn menace.

1103
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,530
He's not going to shoot me.
Are you, Zack?

1104
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:53,890
You I want to talk to.
It's him I want to kill.

1105
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:55,330
Please come back later.
I want to talk to you...

1106
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:56,770
and I have to talk to him.

1107
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:59,730
I'd rather hear the gun go off
than listen to this shit.

1108
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:37,090
Hey, handsome.

1109
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:41,850
- Need some company, maybe?
- Oh, God.

1110
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,490
Guess not.

1111
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:59,130
Get away from me.
I'll kill myself.

1112
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,610
I swear to God I will.

1113
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,930
No, you won't.

1114
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:04,730
You don't have anything
to say about it.

1115
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:06,690
I'm doing this for me.

1116
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:12,970
Ever wonder what it is with you
and women named Eve?

1117
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:17,330
I am never going to forgive
my father for calling me that.

1118
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:21,970
If I knew who he was.

1119
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:28,810
Don't! One more step,
and you'll get splattered.

1120
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:30,770
That's right.
Now get away from me.

1121
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,690
Get away.

1122
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:44,730
I've always found
the naughty part of town.

1123
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,050
Futile fucking hopes.

1124
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,330
Vengeful dreams.

1125
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:03,770
How do you like that?
Professor Poet.

1126
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,850
You don't mean it, Eve.

1127
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:10,010
How do you know what I mean?

1128
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:13,930
Who do you think you are
lying to me all the time?

1129
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:17,130
Who do you think you are
lying to me all the time?

1130
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:23,450
You are no better than I am.
You and me are just the same.

1131
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:28,810
Then maybe I should join you.

1132
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,050
What are you doing?

1133
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:35,730
You're not alone in the dark.
Fuck hope and dreams.

1134
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:41,170
Mickey, don't do that.

1135
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,730
Come on back.

1136
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:54,250
Please, Mickey?

1137
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:13,090
Mine wasn't loaded.

1138
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,130
Neither was mine.

1139
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,520
Imagine whatever you say to
anyone...

1140
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,920
will count heavily,
be acted upon...

1141
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,840
whether you're right or wrong.

1142
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,760
That's a tremendous
responsibility.

1143
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,680
I never thought of that.

1144
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,800
So I'm learning, Betty,
like you and so many others.

1145
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,000
I'm devoting my life to learn
about men and women.

1146
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,120
But you have to help me,
Dr. Love.

1147
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,440
I've no one else
I can discuss this with.

1148
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,080
I'll do whatever you tell me.

1149
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:53,240
But that's my point, Betty.
You can't just listen to me.

1150
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,600
Even I have to be careful of
listening to myself.

1151
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,960
But, Dr. Love,
everybody listens to you.

1152
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,200
Betty, I'm not God.
I mean, I share with you...

1153
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,120
the sum of my experiences
and my knowledge...

1154
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:11,720
but I'm just a clown.

1155
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,240
You are so wonderful.
I think you're just fantastic.

1156
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,160
Thank you so much
for being there for me.

1157
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,600
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

1158
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,960
I listen to you every day.
You're the greatest person.

1159
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,720
What are you always worried
about money for?

1160
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,640
- 'Cause I ain't got none.
- Nice show, don't you think?

1161
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,720
See you later, Ralph.

1162
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,120
How about dinner tonight?

1163
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:35,960
Well, Nancy,
let me think about it.

1164
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,680
Yes. Well, you think about it.

1165
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,440
Tune in 2:00 to 5:00
for another session...

1166
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,400
with Dr. Nancy Love on KCMY,
your station.

1167
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,200
On vacation in Las Vegas?

1168
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,080
Gambling?

1169
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,000
You could call it that.

1170
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,200
- I'm on my honeymoon.
- Oh, how lovely.

1171
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,560
Had you been planning it
for long?

1172
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,120
All my life.

1173
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:15,240
Marriage is a very sacred thing.

1174
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,920
So I've heard.

1175
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:27,800
Marriage is a sacred thing.
Isn't it?

1176
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,960
In a beautiful but sordid way.

1177
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,720
I don't know why
I ask you anything.

1178
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,160
You're a lunatic.

1179
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,040
That's why you chose me.
