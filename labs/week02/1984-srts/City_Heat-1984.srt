1
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,633
- Evening, lieutenant.
- Louie.

2
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,052
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

3
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,939
Forget it, lieutenant.
Their free refills were killing me anyway.

4
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,968
Mike Murphy been in yet?

5
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,263
- Who?
- Murphy. Michael.

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,557
I don't know him, pal.

7
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,603
That's funny.
I hear he eats here every night.

8
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,730
Murray, you say?

9
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:33,529
Murphy, brick brain.
Your ears need unplugging?

10
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,534
- So?
- No, he ain't been in yet.

11
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,288
I'll wait.

12
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,478
Damn. Damn.

13
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,387
Hello, Louie.

14
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,058
Got an emergency. They need
your meat loaf down at the river.

15
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,186
The levee's got a hole in it...

16
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,647
and meat loaf's the only thing
that can stop it up for a year.

17
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,067
Hey.

18
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,530
Somebody left the cage door open, huh?
It's out.

19
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,657
What's the occasion?

20
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,745
Archie, how you doing?

21
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,308
- Not too bad. And you?
- Not too bad.

22
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,185
Good.

23
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,437
- How's the stew?
- Not too good.

24
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,606
That's too bad.
I was counting on the stew.

25
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,068
I had my mouth set on it.
I'll try the Ritz.

26
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,237
- Maybe not.
- This here is Archie.

27
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,657
Really? Ain't that peculiar?

28
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,993
- What?
- See, Archie...

29
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,663
we're looking for a gumshoe
named Mike Murphy.

30
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,833
Guy about your size
with a mustache like you.

31
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,504
Even drives a Model A Roadster like you,
with the same license plate too.

32
00:04:55,671 --> 00:05:01,927
- Now, ain't that peculiar?
- Yeah, that's peculiar.

33
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,851
They're a couple of cupcakes.

34
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,562
I guess this wouldn't work again.

35
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,082
Oh, Speer.

36
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,587
Lieutenant, aren't you gonna do anything?

37
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,464
How about a refill?

38
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,054
He can take care of himself.

39
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,690
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
I got a situation here.

40
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,657
I know we're not really close
anymore, but let by...

41
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,965
- You back?
- Fuck, yes, I'm back.

42
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,052
You know why I'm back?
Because I'm being killed.

43
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,159
What are you gawking at?

44
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,639
- You waiting for them to kill me?
- They competitors?

45
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,559
Or did you have your nose
in the wrong ass?

46
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,811
- There's plenty left for you.
- Say when.

47
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,356
Mike, please. There's not much left.

48
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,652
- Anytime, Speer.
- Until then, you watch your step.

49
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,281
- You hear me?
- What are you talking about?

50
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,993
I'm talking about rumors
of a frayed-collar peeper...

51
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,704
trying to get in bed
with the wrong snot balls.

52
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:38,500
Of course, that wouldn't be you.
You're too much of a fancy Dan.

53
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,171
So?

54
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,841
- I'll be watching.
- I'm shaking.

55
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,886
So long, shorty.

56
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,182
You pathetic son of a bitch.

57
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,643
He's so pathetic.
I turned in my badge, you know.

58
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,022
I got my own... I got my own office now!

59
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,151
I got my name in gold.
You're just jealous.

60
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,362
You're so insecure, it's unbelievable.

61
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,201
Is this frayed?

62
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,000
How you doing, boss?

63
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,212
- Fine, fine, doing fine.
- Alrighty.

64
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,925
- Keep the change.
- Thanks a million. Much obliged.

65
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,060
The finance company just called.
Those mugs last night were after your car.

66
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,812
Repo guys?

67
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,023
Seems they don't enjoy their work
as much as they used to.

68
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,944
You owe $98.98, Mike.
It's the cash or the keys.

69
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,362
Mahoney.

70
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,780
- Who?
- The landlord.

71
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,617
Do I have to do everything?
I told you to send that check weeks ago.

72
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,245
- Oh, my gosh!
- I can't stand irresponsibility.

73
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,746
I know. I'm so...

74
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,917
Still singing that song? Ain't never
worked. Ain't never gonna work.

75
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,629
You remember my silent
and invisible partner, Mr. Swift.

76
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,716
We thought you were Mahoney...

77
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,844
president of the Landlord's
Malevolent Association.

78
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,513
- Behind in our rent again.
- The word is "still."

79
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,977
Tell Mr. Mahoney to fix the plumbing,
or we're gonna move to a better dump.

80
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,396
Mike, catch me. I'm gonna faint.

81
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,481
I suppose Murphy and Swift...

82
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,651
are financially delinquent
with regards to their secretary.

83
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,486
- Somewhat.
- One week, two weeks?

84
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,488
- Three.
- For shame.

85
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:17,409
- Months.
- Oh, now that's what I call loyalty.

86
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,371
And a little bonus. How's that?

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,792
Addy, take a letter somewhere.

88
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,670
Yes, sir, Mr. Murphy. Sir.

89
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,097
Yes.

90
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,726
Free Spirit in the seventh.

91
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,315
You've never been that lucky,
and you ain't that smart.

92
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,694
- People change.
- Not you.

93
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,698
I heard a rumor about you last night.

94
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,700
Taletelling, Mike?

95
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,788
- I didn't figure you were the type.
- Snot balls play hard.

96
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,040
It warms my cockles knowing you care.

97
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,751
You're not that good, Dehl.

98
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,302
Hello. Hey, sugar. Fine.

99
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,181
Tonight at 8? Okay. Bye-bye.

100
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,600
Gotta breeze, Mike.

101
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,270
Promises to keep and all.

102
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,272
Oh, by the way...

103
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,692
don't be surprised if you receive
a little bonus soon.

104
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,402
Why would that happen?

105
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,612
Maybe because
you're the only guy around...

106
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,407
who's got trouble telling dark from light.

107
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,871
- Take care of yourself.
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,750
Don't spend it all in one place.

109
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,339
I won't even ask.

110
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,426
- I appreciate that.
- Here.

111
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,889
That's your bonus.

112
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:06,977
I'm investing in the company.
Can't do much detecting without a car.

113
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,064
Addy...

114
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,364
thank you.

115
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,297
I'll see you.

116
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,619
It's all arranged.

117
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,131
You must not give it
to Pitt before I've gone.

118
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,092
Tomorrow night.

119
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,112
Ginny, baby.

120
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:52,161
If it's worth 25,000 to Primo Pitt, then
it's worth twice that much to Leon Coll.

121
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,872
- Dehl.
- Why not?

122
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,376
You know why not.
If you double-cross Pitt...

123
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,545
I got protection from Coll.

124
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:05,883
Now listen, when you finish here,
meet me back at my place, okay?

125
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,135
Dehl?

126
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,222
Please don't do this.

127
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,683
Come on, baby, stop worrying.

128
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,812
In 48 hours, you'll have
everything you ever wanted.

129
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:38,540
Hey, sugar, cheer up. There ain't
nothing left but the good times.

130
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,456
Hello?

131
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:23,418
- Mike?
- Hello, sweetness.

132
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,003
Guess what I'm doing.

133
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:30,050
From the sound, you're either
making gin or taking a bath.

134
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:34,972
Lying there all warm and soapy,
watching your pores open up.

135
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,767
I could help. Come right over
and get those hard to reach places.

136
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:43,063
Actually, I'm making a list for this party
I'm giving. Would you come?

137
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,399
Please? I need cheering up.

138
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,152
And I haven't smiled since last Tuesday.
Do you remember Tuesday?

139
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,405
- Was it raining?
- Yes, it was.

140
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,283
Maybe I'm confused. Maybe you were...

141
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,618
Monday. Yeah, or Sunday. Yeah.

142
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,496
- Sunday was nice.
- You bitch, I was with you Sunday...

143
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,708
and Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.

144
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,628
- Well, what happened to Thursday?
- Thursday I was in traction.

145
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,673
Do you want to be Friday?
Come to my party.

146
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,926
- I might be late.
- Oh, early is boring.

147
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,972
That's why I like you so much,
because you're always so late.

148
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,516
How about I come over and be late now?

149
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,435
I've too much to do.

150
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,936
Just come to my party.

151
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,899
Maybe.

152
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,026
Good night, luscious.

153
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:48,629
Okay, I'll come over and buff your body
and bring a nice glow to your cheeks.

154
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,173
I'll bring a nice foot to your ass.

155
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:57,638
- Who dialed the phone for you, Speer?
- I've been hearing that rumor again.

156
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,599
Once is a pain in the ass,
twice is a bore.

157
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,392
Once is all you get, pal.

158
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,688
I'm tired, Speer. Why don't you save
the patter for the pulp reporters?

159
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:11,026
There's a good card at the arena tonight,
and I'm holding two tickets.

160
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,655
- You think I'd go to the fights with you?
- Who invited you?

161
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:20,369
- I'm calling you for Addy's number.
- Not a chance. I like the girl too much.

162
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:26,291
- See you around, shorty.
- Not if I see your mug first, flatfoot.

163
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,769
Go for the eye!

164
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,709
Thanks for the invite, lieutenant.
I like the fights.

165
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,336
No, honest, I really do.

166
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,213
I love watching two sweaty...

167
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,217
sinewy, nearly-naked guys
bounce each other around.

168
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,220
Raises all my prurient interests.

169
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,723
Well, that's great.

170
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,518
You don't have to be so formal.
Why don't you call me "Speer"?

171
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,208
Come on. Go. Go.

172
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,130
Come on!

173
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,386
Way to go.

174
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:07,518
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

175
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,145
Ten. You're out.

176
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,276
- A toast.
- A toast.

177
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,076
- Where you going?
- One more picture over here.

178
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,551
Better be good, sunshine.

179
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,929
Name's not "Sunshine,"
and it's 50,000 good.

180
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,889
Fifty thousand?

181
00:21:55,023 --> 00:22:00,362
- I don't like clowns, sunshine.
- Told you, my name is not "Sunshine."

182
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,364
Spit it out or you're a memory.

183
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,950
How does "bookkeeper" strike you, huh?

184
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,537
- What about him?
- He sold you out.

185
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:13,208
- To who?
- Primo Pitt for 25 big ones.

186
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,793
What did he sell?

187
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,588
A cleaver big enough
to cut yours clean off.

188
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,591
Yeah.

189
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,647
Pitt got the stuff?

190
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,317
Not yet.

191
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,988
- But you'll get it back.
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:48,160
For 50,000. Half now, half on delivery.

193
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,622
Don't got that much on me.

194
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,543
Tell you what. The bookkeeper does.

195
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,881
On the river. Pier 14, Star of Bolivia.

196
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:05,302
Just have one of your mutts
drop it at my place.

197
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,978
- And the goods?
- Don't worry, you'll hear.

198
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:21,401
- Dehl. Dehl.
- Yeah?

199
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,447
Cross me and you're snail food.

200
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,348
This is crummy, Speer.

201
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:55,185
I better check this out.
It may be for his own good.

202
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,095
Look what the rat dragged in.

203
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,184
Sugar, it's all gonna be fine.

204
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,066
What kind of game are you playing, Pitt?

205
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,946
Did you have a good time at the fight?

206
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,492
- Wasn't nothing.
- Maybe not.

207
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,247
You're in a lot of trouble, shoe fly.
Open that case.

208
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,754
Open the case.

209
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,726
Run!

210
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,397
Get her!

211
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,155
Stay there.

212
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,377
Jesus!

213
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,767
Come on! Come on! Come on!

214
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:27,416
- Everything all right?
- All right for me, not so good for him.

215
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,753
- He took a four-story fall.
- Fall?

216
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,506
- He had help.
- Bastards.

217
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:38,218
- Didn't know you two were so close.
- He was my partner.

218
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,596
That's right, he was.

219
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:48,395
We dug two.38s and a.45 out of
the walls, a 9 mm out of the ceiling.

220
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:53,317
Now this in here was chasing Ginny Lee
when I bumped into him.

221
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:58,405
- She got away.
- Vint Diestock, one of Pitt's soldiers.

222
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,241
Dehl's gun was in his holster.

223
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:08,707
- What'd you do with Addy?
- I sent her home in a patrol car.

224
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:13,879
Boy, you really know how to show
a girl a good time, Speer.

225
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,154
Mr. Coll wants to see you.

226
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,283
Hard or easy, Murphy?

227
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,421
Mr. Murphy.

228
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:00,509
- Mr. Coll.
- Well, I'm so glad you could come.

229
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:04,596
- Make yourself comfortable. A drink?
- No, thanks.

230
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,392
Swell-looking joint you got here.

231
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,812
- Fruits of my labor.
- Yeah.

232
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,358
Don't tell me why you asked me up here.
Let me guess.

233
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,987
You're a night kind of guy.
You like to invite new friends up.

234
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:24,658
Chew the rag a little bit. What do
you want to gab about, fish face?

235
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:34,084
- I saw your late partner tonight.
- Oh, yeah?

236
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,587
Was that about 1:00...

237
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,840
when he tried to fly out of the
fourth-floor window without wings?

238
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,885
- You know I didn't dust him.
- How do I know that?

239
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:46,680
Because you remember all about Mr. Pitt,
don't you?

240
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:50,475
Oh, yeah. Primo Pitt. Hell of a guy.

241
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,439
He came in second to you
in the snot-ball pageant.

242
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:01,361
- You're close to a manners lesson.
- You're close to getting your ass kicked.

243
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,741
- You want some of me, pal? Come on.
- Not now.

244
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,957
Where do you stand, Murphy?

245
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:18,170
You and Dehl, you had a fix
with Mr. Pitt, right?

246
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:22,591
So, Dehl, he pulls a double-cross.

247
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:25,802
Now, you in with him
or he's screwing you too?

248
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,596
He was my partner.

249
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:34,311
- He couldn't cut it. Can you?
- He was my junior partner.

250
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:38,607
I taught him practically nothing
of what I know.

251
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,487
So you'll get my goods back for me, then?

252
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:49,618
Well, I didn't talk to Dehl
before he went out for some air.

253
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:52,538
I don't know the financial arrangement.

254
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,548
This now,
another like it when I take possession.

255
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,217
Fifty thousand or forget it.

256
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,679
Agreed.

257
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,683
Good. Tell the little rodents
to fix me a drink, will you?

258
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,476
Two.

259
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,929
Wait till you see the bedroom.

260
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:10,569
When was the last time
you talked to Primo Pitt?

261
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,324
I've never talked to Primo Pitt.

262
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,660
Well, two of his guns are parked
right across the street.

263
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,964
- Cadillac?
- Yeah.

264
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,425
You rate the heavy artillery.

265
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:38,013
Maybe they're waiting for you.
Did you ever think of that?

266
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,099
I ducked in the alley, came up the back.

267
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:42,601
What are you drinking?

268
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,395
Tea. I found it in the bottle
under the sink.

269
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,482
Or what's left of your sink.
It tastes like gin.

270
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:52,277
It is gin, my gin.

271
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,323
You didn't sly up here
just to prove you're stealthy.

272
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,535
We fished Aram Strossell
out of the river today.

273
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,704
- Leon Coll's bookkeeper.
- A friend of yours?

274
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:05,165
He was gonna do my taxes next year.

275
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,877
He was wired to a cement block.
The wire broke, and he popped up...

276
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,673
in front of a seafood restaurant,
much to the chagrin of the customers.

277
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,802
- Catch of the day.
- Very funny.

278
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,680
Want to quote me odds on the connection...

279
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,558
between Dehl and the bookkeeper?

280
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,520
Or the link between you and them?

281
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,276
They dug a slug out of the mess
that was left of Dehl.

282
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,279
It was a 9 mm.

283
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:39,199
One of those wouldn't be too good
for your looks either, shorty.

284
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,085
Duck.

285
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,563
That's right.

286
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,359
- Yeah?
- Roll it down further.

287
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,004
It's against the law
to lie down in the street.

288
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:38,008
- I never laid down on the street.
- Sure you did. You were hit by a truck.

289
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,261
- What truck?
- Next one that comes along.

290
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:45,349
- Look, lieutenant...
- You look. I don't like sludge like you.

291
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:49,811
In fact, it wouldn't break my heart at all
to scrape the street clean of your ilk.

292
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:53,315
- You know what an "ilk" is, don't you?
- A big deer.

293
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,527
Yeah. Now, if I catch you loitering
around my precinct again...

294
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,946
I'm gonna shoot me an ilk. You understand?

295
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,907
All right, throw your cannons
out the window.

296
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,743
Come on, I hear a truck coming.

297
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,289
Good boy.

298
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:30,769
Pretty stealthy, lieutenant.
Pretty stealthy.

299
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:11,935
- Hello, Tuck. How you feeling?
- Good.

300
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,730
Getting plenty of raw meat, are you?
That's good.

301
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:18,150
- Say, "The Leith police dismisseth us."
- What?

302
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,652
- It's a test they give radio announcers.
- What?

303
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,905
- You don't wanna be a radio announcer?
- No.

304
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:26,450
- C'est la vie, Tuck.
- Yeah.

305
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,790
- Hello, Freddie.
- Well, Murph.

306
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,753
- Care for a taste?
- I'm full of tea.

307
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,172
You're supposed to flush that,
not smoke it.

308
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,133
Now, don't razz my ass, Mike. I'm low.

309
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,512
- Why?
- Ginny.

310
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,598
I do some fine coin with her singing.

311
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,725
She hits them notes real nice.

312
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,354
You worried about business, Freddie?

313
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:00,734
What the hell, Mike,
I never could jive you.

314
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,903
I'm worried about her.

315
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,907
Last night when Dehl was dumped,
he was here, wasn't he?

316
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,953
He came here about 8:00 to see Ginny?

317
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,957
Yeah. Ginny and the bookkeeper.

318
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:20,254
Thanks a lot, Freddie.
And kill those before they kill you.

319
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:31,723
- It's black tie, sir.
- Thank God I've got one.

320
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:38,313
Everybody's going.
Pres, Buffy, Boo, Binky, everyone.

321
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,148
- Well, just pull it out.
- Yes.

322
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,276
I love it when you talk that way.

323
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:46,280
He'll never know the difference if I...
Oh, Mike! Finally!

324
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,955
- Keith, this is Michael Twitchell Murphy.
- Hi.

325
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:58,667
- Where does the "Twitchell" come from?
- The milkman.

326
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,547
- Mike, this is Keith Stoddard, Esq.
- Where's the "esquire" come from?

327
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,133
- Mama the heiress or Papa the pirate?
- Oh, Mike.

328
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,179
- How'd you like to step outside?
- Oh, I don't think so.

329
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:14,349
See, I'm gonna go upstairs and try to put
a twinkle in both of Caroline's eyes.

330
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:16,560
If I'm not too tired afterwards, though...

331
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,062
I'll come down
and pop your face inside out.

332
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,940
Good night, Keith.

333
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:47,549
I don't know how you got in,
but you're not gonna get out so easy.

334
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:53,764
Well, maybe I'll use you as a shield, blind
those goons of yours with your jammies.

335
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,390
What do you want?

336
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:58,352
They picked a 9 mm slug out of Dehl Swift.

337
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,937
What's a Dehl Swift?

338
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,856
You won't mind
if I take this for ballistics?

339
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,943
You're not gonna take this gun
without a warrant.

340
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,362
I wasn't planning to.

341
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,490
Oh, Mother! Jesus!

342
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,667
Just want the bullet.

343
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,798
I'm kind of scared, Mike.

344
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,551
It'll be light soon.

345
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,638
I'm falling in love with you, Murphy.

346
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,600
Real love. And it scares me.

347
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:42,271
I know what you mean.

348
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,774
Say that again.

349
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:49,319
Well, I should be running.
It's getting a little late, you know?

350
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,488
You son of a bitch!

351
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,616
- You can't say it, can you?
- What?

352
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:58,579
You tried, but you couldn't,
you big palooka!

353
00:42:58,745 --> 00:42:59,788
Where you going?

354
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,292
I pour my heart out, and you put
your pants on. You dope!

355
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,003
Big palooka-dope!

356
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,339
Son of a bitch!

357
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,302
Morning, angel.

358
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,179
This just came.

359
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,851
- It's addressed to Dehl.
- In his own handwriting.

360
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,728
Oh, yeah?

361
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,660
- "Majestic Pawnshop."
- This is it, boss.

362
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:41,246
I see that.

363
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:48,086
So after you go to the beauty shop,
you could pick up my laundry?

364
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,050
Primo Pitt. Somebody kicked over
the rock you live under...

365
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,136
and you had to crawl out
into the sunshine.

366
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,766
Scram.

367
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:13,946
- Your partner crossed me.
- Really? That's a shame.

368
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:18,200
His squeeze or you
has got something I want.

369
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,328
What could that be? I know.

370
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,581
The address of a good plastic surgeon.

371
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:28,877
He's a funny man.

372
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:32,172
Don't matter who's got it.
You're gonna hand it over.

373
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,468
- Why would I do that?
- Because I got something you want.

374
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:42,808
The only thing I want
is to see your ass walk out of here.

375
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:49,314
Phone's ringing.

376
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,990
- Yeah?
- Mike?

377
00:44:58,157 --> 00:45:02,161
- I've been kidnapped.
- Where are you?

378
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,581
This is ridiculous! What's going on?

379
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,083
- You okay?
- Hell, no!

380
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,546
My hair's a mess.
I broke two of my fingernails.

381
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:15,340
I don't have my makeup.

382
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:20,012
And I'm stuck here with these
two ugly, smelly garbage cans!

383
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:21,847
Caroline.

384
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,058
Caroline!

385
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:30,606
You son of a bitch!

386
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:35,110
All right.

387
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:39,740
I'll give you whatever you want.
Let her go.

388
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:48,832
She walks when I hold the goods.

389
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,335
Come on.

390
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,023
Did you tab that.45 yet?

391
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,692
How about the 9 mm?

392
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:17,319
They match?

393
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,033
Good.

394
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:29,665
Croix de Guerre. French medal of honor.

395
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,751
When Dehl was good,
he was very, very good.

396
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:37,506
Pretty fancy for the bottom
of a Cracker Jack box.

397
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:38,966
I didn't hear you knock.

398
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:42,344
What a relief. I thought I was going deaf.

399
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,973
What do you want, Speer?

400
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,853
We ID'd the .45, the 9 mm.
Dub Slack and Primo Pitt.

401
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:54,356
- Is it enough to nail them?
- Not with their alibi.

402
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,859
We need an eyewitness.

403
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,863
That's why you will tell me
when you find Ginny Lee, right?

404
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,366
- What makes you think I'm after Ginny?
- Questions you're asking.

405
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,118
The places you're asking them.

406
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,453
Always pushing people around, aren't you?

407
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,746
Always on the prod.

408
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:13,959
- That's how you do the job, remember?
- You're damn right I remember.

409
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:19,381
Okay. No clinches, no rabbit punches
and please, no hitting below the belt.

410
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:23,093
Now shake hands, and at the sound
of the bell, come out slugging.

411
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,345
Anything to drink around here?

412
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:30,684
We're out of tea. There's some
furniture polish under the sink.

413
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,686
I'll get it.

414
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:37,191
Why do you both go at each other
so hard? Do you enjoy it?

415
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,401
Yeah.

416
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,032
Hello?

417
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:47,659
Hello?

418
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,370
Hello?

419
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,543
- One more time and I hang up.
- Mike?

420
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,338
- Who is this?
- It's me, Ginny Lee.

421
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:01,590
You all right, kid? Where are you?

422
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,675
Mike, I got trouble. Can you meet me?

423
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:07,763
- Where?
- The park. You know, the pavilion?

424
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,972
When?

425
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,682
When?

426
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:17,981
Sick friend.

427
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,071
Mike had to take off.

428
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:27,199
- He's good at that.
- Yeah.

429
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:30,619
- Care for a drink?
- Sure, why not?

430
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,084
Thanks, lieutenant.

431
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:47,261
- Really is furniture polish.
- Yeah.

432
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:51,723
Shocking what Prohibition
forces people to drink.

433
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:55,936
So we're back to lieutenant, huh?

434
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:58,021
- It's what you are, right?
- Yeah.

435
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,901
First, last, always,
seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

436
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:07,656
Look, I'm sorry about the other night.
That wasn't too good.

437
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,742
Forget about it.

438
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,872
I better go.

439
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:18,167
- What?
- I've gotta go.

440
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:22,713
- Someday I'll figure it out.
- What?

441
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:27,551
Mike's not the only one around here
who's good at taking off.

442
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,072
Caroline Howley, the society twist.

443
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,869
Pitt took a hell of a chance
kidnapping Randolph Howley's daughter.

444
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,664
He must expect big things from Mr. Murphy.

445
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:41,708
Like the bookkeeper's merchandise?

446
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:47,005
It's time we had another meet
with Mr. Murphy.

447
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,610
Come back for me in five minutes.

448
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,613
Hike!

449
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,159
Fancy seeing you here.
Well, it's a small world after all.

450
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,827
Hike!

451
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,877
Just leave me alone.

452
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:10,839
You really should be nice to me.
You belong in the back, you know.

453
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,260
Why don't you get
the hell out of here, huh?

454
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:18,180
- Now.
- Why weren't you in the last scrimmage?

455
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,564
I waited in the park for two hours, kid.

456
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,526
I'm sorry, Mike.

457
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:32,528
I had to be sure.

458
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:35,155
Are you sure?

459
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:38,367
I don't know.

460
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,245
I don't know anything anymore.

461
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,791
They killed Dehl.

462
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,584
I know.

463
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,380
You're a witness.
They're gonna try to kill you too.

464
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:54,383
Sweet Jesus! What am I supposed to do?

465
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,429
- You can call Speer.
- Oh, God. Mike, I can't do that.

466
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:05,143
I know he's a bastard, but he's straight.
He's good at his job too.

467
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,521
He'll keep you safe.

468
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:12,693
You can put Pitt at the scene of
a murder. Don't you understand?

469
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:19,408
- He'll kill me if I go to Speer.
- He'll kill you if you...

470
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,744
He'll kill you if you don't.

471
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:28,000
Either way, Ginny Lee Lewis is...

472
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,837
Where are the bookkeeper's goods?
Where is it?

473
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,714
- I don't know.
- Pitt says you do.

474
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:36,925
I don't. I swear I don't.

475
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:41,722
Dehl made... He made
some kind of a switch.

476
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,850
Yeah, he was good at that.

477
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,603
Always chasing rainbows.

478
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:55,277
Ginny, did you ever see this key before?

479
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,363
No.

480
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,449
Damn.

481
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:05,204
Did he say anything new?
Talk about anything different?

482
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:12,002
He was talking about getting into shape.

483
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:16,089
He said he was playing handball.
I don't know.

484
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,300
Where?

485
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,802
Somewhere near his place.

486
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,308
All right, I'm gonna go now, kid.

487
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,897
It's gonna be okay.

488
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,652
Call Speer.

489
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:42,324
Hey, you're running the wrong way.

490
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:32,541
- Evening.
- Yeah.

491
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:37,171
Boy, it's so cold tonight
it makes you want to be a boilermaker.

492
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,090
And how the hell would you know?

493
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:46,388
Because I was pounding a beat
when you were still peeing your pants.

494
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:49,766
I used to freeze my ass off
right on the same street.

495
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,644
So many times I thought about
becoming a boilermaker.

496
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,688
See, I was a hotshot like you.

497
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:57,816
Didn't have any respect for the badge
or the uniform.

498
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,278
I got my own business now.
Know what I'm doing?

499
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,155
I'm still freezing my ass off...

500
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:07,868
and taking a lot of flack
from a snot-nosed rookie like you.

501
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:12,122
- I'm sorry.
- Ain't we all.

502
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:16,251
- You know 10th Street?
- Used to be my beat.

503
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:20,422
Are there any athletic clubs around there?

504
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:24,051
- Gymnasiums?
- Riverside Athletic on Broad Street.

505
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,763
Thanks.

506
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,806
Anytime.

507
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,065
Oh, lieutenant, I didn't see you.

508
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,109
Muldoon.

509
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,560
Excuse me.

510
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,225
Oh, my God!

511
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,801
- Where's the locker room?
- It's over there.

512
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:31,094
Thanks.

513
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,347
Get on the heavy bag.

514
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,233
Hey, buddy. Can I help you?

515
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:46,485
Yeah, I wanna see Dehl Swift's locker.

516
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:49,446
- Yeah, why?
- I'm here to pick up his stuff.

517
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,491
I can't let you in his locker
without his permission.

518
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,285
That'll be a little tough. He's dead.

519
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,747
I'm the executor of his estate.

520
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,710
- How did he die?
- Suddenly.

521
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,092
Well, there's his locker right here, 628.

522
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,885
Thank you.

523
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,683
Yeah, okay.

524
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:32,865
- Lt. Speer?
- Yeah.

525
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:35,742
- I'm Dr. Breslin.
- Doc, how is she?

526
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,579
She fractured the radius and ulna
on her left arm...

527
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:42,583
cracked the 10th, 11th and 12th ribs
on her left side and banged her head.

528
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,128
That could mean a concussion. So we're
gonna watch her for a few days.

529
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:49,464
- Can I talk to her?
- Maybe tomorrow.

530
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,285
Addy!

531
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:22,206
I got it! I got a feeling I got it!

532
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:25,292
You know how I am when I got a feeling.

533
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:34,718
This is what got Strossell
and Dehl killed.

534
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,678
Mike.

535
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:41,683
It's a dull knife anyway.

536
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,608
Holy mackerel!

537
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:52,861
I had no idea Dehl was in so deep.

538
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:59,326
This could put Coll away forever and
change Pitt from Mr. Two to Mr. One.

539
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:03,330
- Mike. Got some bad news.
- What?

540
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:06,416
- Caroline's been kidnapped.
- How'd you find out?

541
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,585
Just heard it on the radio. You know?

542
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,505
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

543
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,049
- And that's not all.
- What?

544
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:16,552
- Ginny Lee's in City General.
- What?

545
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,596
Speer called, said she was hit by a car.

546
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,473
No.

547
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:25,227
- Guess I'll go home?
- No! No, no, no, stay.

548
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:27,229
Furniture polish.

549
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,253
Better call Fat Freddie,
tell him about Ginny.

550
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,546
I already did.

551
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,425
You do good work, kid.

552
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,769
- Hello?
- This is Pitt.

553
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:11,231
I was just on my way over
to see you, Mr. Pitt.

554
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:15,110
- I have the goods.
- You better not double-cross me.

555
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,696
Why would I do
a stupid-ass thing like that?

556
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:22,201
- You do, and she's dead.
- I told you, I'll bring you the goods.

557
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:24,453
She better be okay.

558
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:31,919
You don't hear from me by morning,
tell your friend, the cop...

559
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:35,255
to drag the river with a magnet.

560
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,299
Mike.

561
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,055
I know, kid.

562
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,813
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

563
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,504
Now, Addy!

564
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:20,509
Got it.

565
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:26,807
Help.

566
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:00,544
No.

567
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,675
- I'm covered in gasoline.
- What?

568
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:11,638
- I'm covered in goddamn gasoline!
- Stay the hell away from me.

569
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,630
Oh, I've been doing it all wrong.
I've been hiding.

570
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,549
You just walk down
the middle of the street, huh?

571
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:51,011
Two guys down there on the right,
and two guys on the left.

572
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:54,181
There's four guys down there altogether.

573
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,897
Oh, no.

574
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:13,427
Hey!

575
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,388
We did all right, huh? What a team.

576
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:19,475
I start off slow,
but I had to set them up for you.

577
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:24,980
Don't tell me why you hit me.
Let me guess.

578
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:28,192
They took the tire out of your cage,
and you're peeved.

579
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:30,903
You said you'd tell me
when you found Ginny Lee.

580
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,489
- I don't give a damn...
- Where you going?

581
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,824
I got things to do and places to go, pal.

582
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,868
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

583
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:40,078
For obstructing justice,
assaulting a police officer...

584
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:44,041
disturbing the peace
and anything else I can think of.

585
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,502
They got Caroline.

586
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,630
- Who?
- Pitt.

587
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,718
Let me go. I'll wrap it up in a neat
package and give it to you, all right?

588
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,095
What do you say?

589
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:05,854
- Get out of here.
- I appreciate that. I really do.

590
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:19,868
Next time I see you, I'll hit you so hard,
I'll knock you...

591
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,455
into the Stone Age, where you came from.

592
01:09:28,669 --> 01:09:31,046
- Hello.
- You okay?

593
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:33,382
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

594
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:37,094
- In a cop car?
- My cop car.

595
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:41,140
That would be nice, Speer. Real nice.

596
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:45,435
How come you're not married?

597
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:49,398
- How come you're not?
- I don't know.

598
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,483
Lots of reasons.

599
01:09:53,277 --> 01:09:55,821
Why do you and Mike
go at each other so hard?

600
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:01,034
I don't know. Lots of reasons.

601
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:22,598
Five card draw.

602
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,767
Keep your shirt on.

603
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:41,241
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

604
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,501
- Hi.
- Why did you bust my door?

605
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:54,254
Nobody knocks anymore. Haven't you heard?

606
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,007
- You're nuts, Murphy.
- Where is she?

607
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:59,176
Not here.

608
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,928
Not till I know she's safe.

609
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,723
Exterminate this pest.

610
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,934
Don't you want to know what's in the case?

611
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:12,314
- Hold it! I know what better be in there.
- Oh, that's in there.

612
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:18,737
- I think you just said goodbye.
- And a little surprise just for you.

613
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:21,240
- What?
- Dynamite.

614
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,659
Dynamite?

615
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:27,496
Enough to blow this garage right
over to the wealthy section of town.

616
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,040
You're bluffing.

617
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:34,878
I relax my grip and we go boom!

618
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:40,175
- Blast him.
- We shoot him, boss, he relaxes.

619
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:42,719
Give me that.

620
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,849
I'm calling your bluff.

621
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:53,814
- I hope you like loud noises.
- Evening, gents.

622
01:12:02,156 --> 01:12:04,158
Shorty.

623
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:05,909
Hi.

624
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:09,079
Is this a private party
or can anybody attend?

625
01:12:09,246 --> 01:12:12,833
- I thought you were sitting this one out?
- I lied.

626
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:17,212
What are you pointing the gun
at the suitcase for? It's dead already.

627
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:20,048
Oh, what if I shoot me a live cop?

628
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:23,886
Well, that'd give the 20 officers
I have outside just cause.

629
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:26,054
Check it out.

630
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:29,725
- Hey!
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

631
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,102
You stay where you are.

632
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:36,482
Twenty cops. You're as nuts as him.

633
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,943
We're nuts? He's the one
who's got the drop on the luggage.

634
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:43,238
It's all that corruption.
It corrodes their brains.

635
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:47,576
- He says it's full of dynamite.
- Is it?

636
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:52,498
Well, two sticks of dynamite
and a hand grenade.

637
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:54,917
What were you gonna do
after you dropped it?

638
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:58,462
- I don't know, Ollie.
- I really should go to the bathroom.

639
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:00,839
- Pee in your pants.
- I did that.

640
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:05,761
Nobody out there
but an old man walking his dog.

641
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:10,015
Two dead wise guys.

642
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:13,310
Well, that old man is Sgt. Lefkowitz.

643
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:16,522
Who's the guy in the dog suit?

644
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,816
That's Connors. You remember him.

645
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,401
Right. Short legs,
long tongue, pants a lot.

646
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,446
Okay, give me the case.

647
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:28,075
- Give it to him.
- You got it.

648
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,602
- I'm out of here.
- Get up!

649
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:02,104
Help!

650
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:10,988
You shot Pitt. You killed him,
you big dummy.

651
01:16:11,155 --> 01:16:13,073
What were you shooting at me for?

652
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:15,492
- You were shooting at Pitt.
- He was shooting at you.

653
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,912
I wasn't shooting at you.
I was trying to distract you.

654
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:20,956
Some difference.

655
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:28,797
Where's Caroline?

656
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:31,884
What time is it?

657
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:35,762
What the hell difference does that make
to you now? A little after 1.

658
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:40,434
Two o'clock, I don't call,
she don't breath no more.

659
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:44,021
This ain't so bad.

660
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:48,775
You get to watch me die,
I get to watch you squirm.

661
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:03,999
- Now how do we find Caroline?
- Dub and Nino.

662
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:07,336
What does "Dub and Nino" mean,
you closed-mouth son of a...

663
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:13,425
Make that Dub.

664
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:16,178
That's just terrific.
Just goddamn terrific.

665
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,096
I figured somebody had to go down.

666
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,599
Better him than you. Maybe I was wrong.

667
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:23,477
How we gonna find Caroline
if you shoot the bums...

668
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,230
- that'll tell us where she is?
- We'll get Dub.

669
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,689
Where we gonna get Dub?

670
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:30,734
Where would you go
if you had an ass load of buckshot?

671
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:32,694
- Doc Loomis.
- Now you're thinking.

672
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,322
Don't kill anybody.
Let me say this to you one more time.

673
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:38,367
Do not kill anybody. Do me a favor,
don't save my life anymore.

674
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,035
My pleasure.

675
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:45,541
Speer! It's about time.

676
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,545
She's a pal of the cop's too.

677
01:17:49,753 --> 01:17:56,009
We came looking for answers, but
maybe we found some insurance too.

678
01:17:58,303 --> 01:18:00,722
You know, this is gonna hurt.

679
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:04,601
- Maybe I should give you some ether.
- No ether.

680
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,397
Okay, but there's no reason
both of us should suffer.

681
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:13,193
- Just get it over with.
- Patience, Dub.

682
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,449
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

683
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:22,661
After you get the information,
then you can kill him.

684
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:25,581
- How you been keeping?
- Not too bad. How about you?

685
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:29,168
- Not too bad.
- That's good.

686
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:33,755
Last chance, Dub.

687
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:38,177
I don't know what you're talking about.

688
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,059
No!

689
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:50,814
No! No! You crazy!

690
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,736
Yeah?

691
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:58,405
They still together?

692
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:01,158
Murphy's still got the goods?

693
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,660
Right.

694
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,371
Let me guess.
We're going for a little ride.

695
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,959
Look, if it's all the same to you fellas,
I think I'll just take the trolley.

696
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,754
Didn't have any tokens anyway.

697
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:44,827
Hi.

698
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:46,411
- Your coat, sir?
- Thank you.

699
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,913
- How are you?
- Fine.

700
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:49,665
Good to see you.

701
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,584
Gentlemen!

702
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:56,588
Peg, I want to have you meet my friend
Mr. Smith from St. Louis.

703
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:59,007
- Oh, come right in, Mr. Smith.
- Thanks.

704
01:19:59,216 --> 01:20:02,469
We have quite a few
of your relatives here tonight.

705
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,514
- Your 20 and 100.
- A hundred?

706
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:07,516
- I haven't got that much.
- I win.

707
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:10,269
- The hell you do.
- That ain't the way you play.

708
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:12,521
- It's table stakes.
- Whatever I got in front of me.

709
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:17,526
And I got 20, 30, 35, 37,
and you're called. What do you got?

710
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:19,945
A straight.

711
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:22,948
Full house.

712
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,367
All diamonds.

713
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,342
There's a guy on the roof.

714
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:46,221
Man in the doorway.

715
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:54,062
Okay, we're not going to shoot anybody
until we know Caroline's all right.

716
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:57,065
Right?

717
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,401
Right.

718
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:08,452
Seven card stud,
deuces and one-eyed jacks wild.

719
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:10,537
For Pete's sake!

720
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:23,634
- Is this the place, Ollie?
- That's right, Stanley.

721
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:26,094
Where do you two rum-dums
think you're going?

722
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:29,223
- Is this the public library?
- Look, pal...

723
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,413
All right, what now?

724
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:56,291
You can go up and take out
the goon on the roof.

725
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,043
Why do I go up on the roof?

726
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:02,047
Because I'm stealthy. That means
you've gotta be agile. Right, shorty?

727
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:06,552
Listen, ape face, after this is over,
I'm gonna show you how agile I am.

728
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,348
- You name the time.
- I'll see you inside.

729
01:22:11,557 --> 01:22:16,395
Hey, Speer? Let's not kill anybody
until we get Caroline, okay?

730
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,292
What is this?

731
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,336
Police business.
Take her around the block.

732
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,840
Get your clothes off.

733
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:49,553
It's your bet.

734
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,972
- What?
- You got a deuce.

735
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:53,807
Not so bad now, huh?

736
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:57,936
What are you doing? Go watch the window.

737
01:23:03,066 --> 01:23:06,653
- This bet's 50.
- Nine. King.

738
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:09,990
Hey. Got a match?

739
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,876
And an ace to the dealer. Fair bet.

740
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:24,213
- Hey, I don't see Lefty.
- Probably taking a leak.

741
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:26,048
- Two hundred.
- I'm out.

742
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:28,300
- Call.
- Raise 100.

743
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,179
You're raising?
You haven't got a pair showing.

744
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:35,724
Well, he ain't there.
I think somebody ought to go and check.

745
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:04,711
What are you talking about? What's that?

746
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:10,884
All right.

747
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:15,639
- Your jacket?
- I can't give you my jacket.

748
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:19,351
- And why not?
- Because I've got a gun right here.

749
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:24,773
Hello, lieutenant. Since when
do you have the cathouse detail?

750
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:27,985
I want you, your girls and customers
on the street in five minutes.

751
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:31,446
I'm entertaining two congressmen
and a superior court judge.

752
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:34,408
- And a kidnap victim.
- Primo didn't give me any choice.

753
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:37,661
- Primo's dead.
- We can be out of here in two minutes.

754
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:39,079
Where's the girl?

755
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,290
End of the hall,
facing the street, upstairs.

756
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:42,541
How many guns?

757
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:46,128
Four upstairs, one across the street,
one on the roof, one shooting pool.

758
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:04,480
- How about a fast game of sleeper?
- Never heard of it.

759
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:10,027
Well, it's simple. You go ahead and
make your shot, and I put you to sleep.

760
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:17,826
Okay.

761
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:30,005
I'm agile.

762
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:43,352
Who appointed him the boss anyway?

763
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:49,107
My, Granny, what big eyes you have.

764
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:55,113
My, Granny, what big ears you have.

765
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,448
My, Granny...

766
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,206
- Murphy!
- Hi, Marie.

767
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:05,874
What the hell you doing?

768
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:10,087
I'm gonna do to a couple of mugs what
you're gonna do to the congressman.

769
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,673
Are you ready?

770
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,219
- Six nines.
- Five queens.

771
01:26:17,678 --> 01:26:20,430
Hold it, Barney. You can't have six cards.

772
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,225
- The hell I can't.
- Only five cards count.

773
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:25,853
- Not in this game.
- In any poker game.

774
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,730
This ain't any poker game.
This is her dumb game.

775
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:30,983
Dumb deuces, one-eyed jacks.

776
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:34,528
I don't know if I'm winning
or losing this dumb game.

777
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:51,253
Oh, so big, so strong.

778
01:27:05,142 --> 01:27:10,147
- No, no, I don't want the animal thing.
- Oh, sorry. Keep it up.

779
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:14,818
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

780
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:17,154
- That's everybody but the second floor.
- Good.

781
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:20,115
Not too much breakage, please.

782
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:24,453
Will that make it 40? I raise.
I raise you, Barney, all the time.

783
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:26,705
- What the...?
- What are you doing?

784
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:28,290
Take a walk. Wrong room.

785
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:30,834
- I raised over here.
- You bet. Let's go.

786
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,378
- Hey, baby.
- You hear? I said, take a walk!

787
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:37,341
I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house down!

788
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:56,235
Hold it. Hold it! Later, Speer, later!

789
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:15,504
Boys.

790
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,100
Well, it's about time!

791
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:37,151
Michael Twitchell Murphy,
I'm getting scared again.

792
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:40,654
- No, it's all over now.
- No, I don't mean gangsters.

793
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:43,949
I'm really getting scared, Mike.

794
01:28:44,575 --> 01:28:50,497
- I'm a little terrified myself.
- So, what do we do about it?

795
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,296
Get that camera out of here.

796
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:59,381
All right. Let's go.

797
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,345
I want my goods.

798
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:25,407
Hold it.

799
01:29:30,954 --> 01:29:33,165
You call it.

800
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,341
Let him have it.

801
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:45,928
Easy.

802
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:07,282
Sooner or later, I'm gonna get those rats.

803
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:09,618
I got a feeling it's gonna be sooner.

804
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:23,799
- I thought you said you defused that.
- I lied.

805
01:30:55,414 --> 01:30:57,416
Sit right here, lieutenant.

806
01:30:59,084 --> 01:31:02,796
- Speer, you amaze me.
- Thank you, my dove.

807
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:20,397
Madam.

808
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:29,156
Hi, Addy. You know,
I been thinking it over, and...

809
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:30,824
we make a pretty fair team.

810
01:31:31,575 --> 01:31:33,952
Yeah, I suppose so, shorty.

811
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:37,498
All right, that tears it.

812
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:40,876
Step out here, brass ass,
and let's settle this right now.

813
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:43,378
Hey, pal! Pipe down and then sit down.

814
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:44,880
- Down in front.
- Sit down!

815
01:31:45,088 --> 01:31:49,718
Hey, pal, when you talk to me, stand up.
Sorry, you are standing.

816
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:53,430
No reason to kneel. We're not in church.

817
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:57,476
Oh, boy! We can play ball.
We got three bases.

818
01:32:00,103 --> 01:32:01,730
Play ball.

819
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:20,415
This is either the Woolworth building,
in which case it's okay, or...

820
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:23,460
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

821
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:34,930
Aren't you gonna help him?

822
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:37,599
I abhor violence.

823
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:43,021
"The Leith police dismisseth us."

824
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,693
- I got a situation here.
- So?

825
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:49,278
That's it.

826
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:02,666
I'll take it from here.
Good luck in your radio career.

827
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:06,086
Where we going?
Out there, huh? Fine with me.

828
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:09,214
I need a lot of room for you, pal. Yeah.

829
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,508
I looked up "Neanderthal"
in the dictionary.

830
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:13,760
There was a picture of you.

831
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:15,762
Whereabouts?

832
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:18,640
- Right here.
- That's good for me.

833
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:21,351
I don't know what Addy sees in you.

834
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,562
You know, she should go out with humans.

835
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,314
I was wrong.

836
01:33:25,522 --> 01:33:29,318
- What?
- You can't take care of yourself.

837
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:34,323
They wrote a song about you.

838
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:37,576
"Brother, Can You Spare a Brain?"

839
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:40,704
- You want to know something?
- What?

840
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:44,625
You'll always be "shorty" to me.

841
