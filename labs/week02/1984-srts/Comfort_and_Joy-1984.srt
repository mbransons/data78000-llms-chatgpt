25
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,499
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

26
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,124
- You'll be the death of me, Maddy.
- Shut up and get the car.

27
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,249
You're going bald. It must be nerves.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,415
Thank you.

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,040
Shit, these are all size large.

30
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,499
You've got to stop it, Maddy.
I can't stand the strain.

31
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,832
Stay home, then.

32
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,207
If you've got to steal things,
then at least be practical.

33
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,374
We needed onions.
We did not need more Christmas lights.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,374
You buy the food, I'll get the goodies.

35
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,165
Please don't smoke in the car, Maddy.

36
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,374
Stop it. Stop it.

37
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,249
Now, Maddy, have you any idea

38
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,415
what a burning cigarette
can do to velour upholstery?

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,957
I can live with the pollution,

40
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,540
but you're becoming a fire hazard too,
and that's a problem.

41
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,207
Now, look, don't get me wrong.
I'm not worried about the car.

42
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,707
I can live without it.
It's your own safety that concerns me.

43
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,624
<i>The summer's gone...</i>

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,999
<i>And all the leaves are dying...</i>

45
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:53,249
Hm. Very, very nice.
Thank you, Maddy. Mwah!

46
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,874
But why the four sets of Christmas lights?

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,957
I want to have lots of lights on the tree.

48
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,790
Uh-huh. Well, we can always use
the other two sets as spares.

49
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,832
No, they'll all go on the tree.

50
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,915
OK. OK.

51
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,999
OK.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,582
Do you want to go out tonight?

53
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,040
No.

54
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,499
Do you want to eat?

55
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,707
Later.

56
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,299
Do you want to wrap
Auntie Betty's handbag?

57
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,415
No.

58
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,582
- No?
- No.

59
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,290
- No? No, no?
- No.

60
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,290
No, no, no? No?

61
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,540
Mm...

62
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,915
Mm-mm.

63
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,624
- What time is it, Alan?
- Christmas time, I think. Mm-hm.

64
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,790
Oh, God.

65
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,374
Just a wee something.

66
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,707
Cheers.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,499
Maddy, I think it's time we took some
of the price tags off these things.

68
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,874
Why?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,665
I think there were some tags
on the olives.

70
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,832
OK.

71
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,374
What are you doing?
Are you collecting them or what?

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,624
I am, yeah. You get a Ford Fiesta.

73
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,249
Are you sure you don't want to go out,
Maddy? It's only eight.

74
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,457
Er... no.

75
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,582
Maddy? What are you up to?

76
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,165
I'm leaving, Alan.

77
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:37,249
I'm taking some things,
my things, and I'm leaving.

78
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,374
I meant to tell you ages ago,
but the moment didn't arise.

79
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,207
I have to go.

80
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,415
I wanted to talk to you about it,
but it just didn't happen.

81
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,999
Maddy, please. Sit down.
We can talk about it now.

82
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,624
It's too late.

83
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,165
George is coming over soon.
He's, er... he's hired a truck.

84
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,624
I meant to tell you ages ago.

85
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,332
It's your sister set this up, didn't she?
It's your crazy sister!

86
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,999
No, it's me. I'm doing it.

87
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,332
I asked George to help me move out.
That... that's all.

88
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,124
To be honest,
this last room may take a while.

89
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,207
No, be all right.
Be finished quick, I would think.

90
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,857
Evening, Alan. All right?

91
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,040
- All right?
- Good evening.

92
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,832
Er... fellows,
if you could go through here...

93
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,915
- Aye, sure.
- There's a table and some chairs.

94
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,790
Well, you're quite serious
about this, then, Maddy?

95
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:46,207
Look, I'm really sorry about this, Alan.
I'm just helping out.

96
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,290
There'll be no hard feelings, eh?
I mean, it's just... you know, just women.

97
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,457
George, there's some more
chairs in the kitchen.

98
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,874
- Right, Maddy.
- Maddy, baby, please talk to me.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,665
- Please stay and talk to me.
- Oh, don't let's drag it out, Alan.

100
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,124
Don't be cruel.

101
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,374
- Could you take that?
- Nice chair.

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,957
Aye, lovely. Sorry.

103
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,749
Maddy!

104
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,999
Please stop this, Alan.
You're not making it easy.

105
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,540
You don't make anything easy.

106
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,790
All right, just leave the book.
I'm reading it, eh?

107
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,540
- Just leave that book. I'm reading it.
- No, put it in the box. It's my book.

108
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,249
I'm halfway through it.
Could you just leave the damn book?

109
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,499
- You didn't buy it.
- Neither did you buy it.

110
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,290
- Well, it's mine.
- Oh, right.

111
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,874
Right. Well, that's my sweater, if it comes
down to it, so give me the sweater.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,499
Oh, you're upset. Don't be childish.

113
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,957
If I'm a child, well, you're a thief!

114
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,749
I only wanted it as a keepsake.

115
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,082
But if you feel that strongly about it,
you can have it.

116
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,874
Have the book too, with my compliments.

117
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,540
I don't want to do this, you know.

118
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,790
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I don't want to do it.

119
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,165
Well, it's very good of you, Alan,
very good. No, no, no, down, down.

120
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,832
Now easy with the handle. Right.

121
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,207
So, you really, really
want to leave, then, eh?

122
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,749
You really want to go?

123
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,582
Now? Leave?

124
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,707
Yeah.

125
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,082
Huh!

126
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,290
It's a bit of a shock.

127
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,249
I know.

128
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,332
I wanted to get the lights
on the tree for you before I left.

129
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,749
Well, come upstairs and do that, then, eh?

130
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,457
No, you do it.

131
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,707
Don't leave it bare.

132
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,582
Can I drive you anywhere?

133
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,040
No, I'll go with George.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,082
Be good.

135
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:01,165
<i>It's six o'clock in the morning!</i>

136

- Good morning, Dicky.

'This is the six o'clock news headlines

'Rival guerrilla groups are claiming victory

'and Radio Berunda last night
announced a total curfew in the capital.'

142

In Washington, the Pentagon has confirmed

that the US fleet at present
exercising off the coast of Berunda

would continue its watching patrol.

In the Middle East, the hoped-for
settlement of fighting in Avonia

146
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,707
has hit new obstacles.

147
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,040
Delegates from both sides abandoned the
Christmas peace conference yesterday

148
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,374
and later fresh rocket attacks
took place at the capital's airport.

27 people died before UN troops
managed to stop the shelling.

And in the Far East,
40 civilian refugees died

in heavy bombing attacks
on the island of Samato

when the Christmas truce there
broke down yesterday.

Opponents of the dictatorship
government of President Barmai

154
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,332
claimed that the armed forces were
deliberately attacking civilian targets

155
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,415
as an act of provocation.

156

More foreign news.

157
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,832
Mamie, the giant panda,
recently arrived at the Moscow Zoo,

158
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,124
as a gift from
the People's Republic of China,

159
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,915
might just be pregnant.

160
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,499
Officials at the Moscow Zoo

161
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,040
said that tests today
should confirm the pregnancy.

162
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,290
All this week, Mamie has been off her food

163
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,332
and suffering from morning sickness.

164
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,790
Mamie needs peace and quiet now,
said the zoo official.

165
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,749
And lastly, the weather
for west central Scotland and the city.

166
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,374
This morning will be milder
than overnight,

167
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,040
still no sign of a white Christmas,

168
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,915
and some light rain might reach
the area by early evening.

169
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,290
The next news at seven,

170
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,832
and now stand by
for your daily dose of Dicky Bird.

171
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,749
<i>National news on the hour!</i>

172
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,290
Thanks for all that wonderful
six o'clock news, Peter.

173
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,207
You know, I keep telling him
that it would be cheaper

174
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,290
to telephone the early news
to those half a dozen poor souls

175
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,540
that have been listening
to yawn-a-minute Kelly all night,

176
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,415
- but he won't listen to me.
- <i>Time to get up!</i>

177
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,082
<i>Hello, Dicky! Good morning!</i>

178
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,499
Hello!

179
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,290
- <i>Hello!</i>
- <i>Good morning! Tweet-tweet!</i>

180
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,790
Anyway, the fun starts now

181
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,165
because Dicky Bird is here
to get you up, get you to work

182
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,999
or wherever it is you have to be by nine.

183

<i>Don't you know what they say
about the early worm?</i>

184
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,457
- <i>The early worm!</i>
- What do they say?

185
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,082
<i>It always gets the bird</i>

186
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,557
Yes, "The Dicky Bird Early Worm Show".

187
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,999
Hello there!

188
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,957
Oh. Hi, Steve.

189
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,374
- You OK, kid?
- Aye, I'm fine, I'm fine.

190
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,290
Keep your pecker up, eh?

191
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,957
He's done it again, folks.
Kelly's fallen asleep at the microphone.

192
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,582
I got here only just in time.

193
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,624
Anyway, here's a quick traffic roundup.

194
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,832
There's absolutely nothing in the streets
right now, not a car in sight,

195
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,499
so why don't you take advantage of that?

196
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,624
Get in your car
and get into work straightaway.

197
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,290
You'll be in three hours early,

198
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,124
and there'll be another traffic roundup
at the same time tomorrow.

199
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,957
And Nancy in the front office
has just come in to tell me that

200
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,165
the lookalikes competition has captured
her imagination again this week.

201
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,790
A man from Paisley has just phoned in

202
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,790
to say that his wife is the absolute
double of Richard Nixon.

203
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,624
Ha-ha-ha! We'll believe anything
that happens in Paisley,

204
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,624
but the rules are either a photograph
sent up here to the station

205
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,082
or why don't you just pop up
and let Nancy check you out in person?

206
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,457
And I can tell you that's a journey
very, very well worth making, eh?

207
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,665
<i>Lookalike, lookalike, someday famous</i>

208
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,082
I've just seen the very lovely Anne
coming in there

209
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,249
to give us the 8.30 travel roundup.

210
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,124
I wonder who Anne
thinks she looks like, eh?

211
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,874
I think there's a little touch
of the Ingrid Bergman in there, eh?

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,624
How are you, Annie? Are you all right?

213
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,207
'Thank you, yes, Dicky, I'm fine.'

214
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,415
OK, now, where should we avoid
traffic-wise today?

215
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,290
'Er... how about everywhere?'

216
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,290
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
I'll leave you to it, then.

217
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,040
'Thank you. Well, Dicky,

Well, what do you want me to say?

00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,540
That she'll be back in a day or two,
with her tail between her legs

and the piano and the dining table?

for a washing machine. Fur coat, maybe.

She, er... didn't leave
her fur coat, did she?

- Was everything hers?

Except for the mortgage. That was mine.

Well, you know Maddy. She was
always acquiring things, you know.

What am I going to do?

246
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,790
Do you realise how lucky you are?

247
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,374
Don't you see
what an opportunity you have?

248

It's a new life. That's what
you've been handed on a plate.

251

There's nothing but you here now.

What a chance!

256
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,790
Look, you've been submerged
in another person's personality,

257
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,540
become a sub-person, and now you're free.

258
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,832
Well, thanks a lot.
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

259
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:46,290
Because Maddy was
just utterly fantastic and special...

260
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,499
and you deserved as much of her
as you were going to get.

But now you've had it.

You were like kids, playing and fighting.

It was a bit of a caper, wasn't it?

266
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:11,040
No, no, don't say that.
No, I worshipped her.

That's not the nicest thing
you can do to somebody, is it?

Ah. What age?

277
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,249

somebody to a second-hand kidney.

What will you do?

284
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:34,082
I'll do some shopping, get some things
for the house, pots and pans and things.

285
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,624
Good lad.

286
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,915

Colin?

290
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,165
- Do you think she loved me?
- Sure she did.

291
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,124
She told me one night when she was drunk.

292
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,915
- She never told me.
- Well, she wouldn't.

293
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,832
Where was I at the time?

294
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,415
You were through in the kitchen
telling Fiona you loved her.

295
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,707
You were drunk too.

296
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,915
You know you can have
all three products the same colour?

297
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,040
- Aye, I know it. It doesn't matter.
- Sure? OK.

298
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,207
I kind of like to mix and match.

299
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,290

Aye, Rufus told me about Madeline leaving.

459
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,624
Who the hell told Rufus?

460
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,290
Anyway, it's got nothing to do
with Maddy. This is work.

461
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:18,040
I think I'm on to something.
I want to chase it up. Make a programme.

462
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:23,249
You know, there are things going on in
this town that would make your hair curl.

463
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:29,332
Have I ever told you about my Navy days?

464
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:33,707
We used to do ship-to-ship transfers.
You know, breeches buoy.

465
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:38,499
Just a little bucket seat
way out there in the ocean.

466
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:44,790
There was a point, you see, when you'd be
halfway between one ship and the other

467
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:48,249
and the swell sometimes
which put both ships out of sight,

468
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,665
oh, for... 15, 20 seconds...

469
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:57,665
and there you'd be,
hanging beneath a bit of rope...

470
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,165
and nothing all around you
but angry water.

471
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,957
Do you get my point?

472
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,207
No.

473
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,499
But surely, I mean, I...
if you're sat there, where you...

474
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,665
- Are you sure you don't get the point?
- Not exactly.

475
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,624
Well, it's... it's depression,
Alan, depression.

476
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,374
You're stuck between where you've been
and where you're going,

477
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,082
and you've lost sight of both.

478
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,624
The secret, Alan, is faith.

479
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:42,374
Next time you look up,
the way ahead will be clear.

480
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,540
Think about it.

481
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:49,540
Can I make a documentary anyway?

482
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:53,999
Alan, the resources of the station
are yours to make use of, you know that,

483
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:58,124
but I don't see any need to tamper with
"The Dicky Bird Early Worm Show",

484
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,499
do you?

485
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,999
Fair enough.

486
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,290
I can pick up a tape recorder
at the newsroom?

487
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,957
Of course you can.

488
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,124
Knock on the door any time, Alan.

489
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,207
Oh, and Alan,

490
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:14,582
don't fret about
these angry seas below you.

491
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,707
I'll be seeing you, Hilary.

492
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,499
Hi, Gloria. Listen, get onto
the legal department, would you?

493
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:31,457
I want the lowdown
on Alan Bird's contract.

494
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,165
Aye, find out if it's yearly
or six-monthly.

495
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:39,499
Oh, and, Gloria, find out
if there's a sanity clause.

496
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,915
No, a sanity clause.

497
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,915
Santa Claus!

498
00:38:57,408 --> 00:39:01,124
Dicky Bird documentary,
"Bird's-eye View", take one.

499
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:07,249
Alan Bird documentary,
"Bird's-eye View", take one.

500
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,124
Here I am in the heart of the city...

501
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,582
talking about this place that...

502
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,624
We all think that we know our own place...

503
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:33,415
our own town, but do we?

504
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,040
How much do we know...

505
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:40,749
or care?

506
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,415
Things happen around us...

507
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:00,165
The other night, I saw two men demolish
an ice-cream van with iron bars.

508
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,165
Can you believe it?

509
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:05,124
Right here in this city.

510
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,749
There are things...

511
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,832
going on in this city
that would make you...

512
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,790
Maddy, please come home.

513
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,082
I want to see you today.

514
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,290
I want to see what you're wearing.

515
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,790
I want you to tell me a joke.

516
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,374
I want to make you something nice to eat.

517
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:43,832
Ice cream is not something that many
of us give a great deal of thought to.

518
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,457
But, um...

519
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:49,874
especially at this time of year, I mean.

520
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:18,040
Hello, Colin? Yeah, this is Alan.
Yeah, this is an SOS.

521
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,290
Can I come over?

522
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:22,332
'Hi, this is Dicky Bird
and I've got a real problem.

523
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,999
'I've just tasted an exciting
new minty snack called EasiChews,

524
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,832
'but I can't decide whether
it's a mint or a chew bar.

525
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,499
'It comes from the people
who make Minty Crunch,

526
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,499
'so you know that
it tastes good and minty,

527
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,832
'but it chews like a real chewy chew bar.

528
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:38,665
'It's a between-meal snack that comes
in four big chocolate-covered fingers.

529
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,915
'Try one, and then you decide.
Is it a mint or is it a chew?

530
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,249
'It's a problem.'

531
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,999
How was the operation yesterday?

532
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,499
- Eh?
- The operation.

533
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,082
Oh, yeah. That was fine. Um...

534
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,332
The bugger had eaten a sandwich
the night before and not told us.

535
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,760
I very nearly sewed his new kidney
onto a piece of tomato.

536
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:12,415
The one essential is a good empty gut.
But the kidney seems like a good match.

537
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:18,624
- What did you do last night?
- I bought some ice cream.

538
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,915
Oh.

539
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,165
Do you know anything about ice cream?
I mean professionally.

540
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,790
- Medically.
- Erm...

541
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,874
- Chemically.
- Not a lot, no.

542
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,832
- You should ask the experts.
- Aye.

543
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,832
Could you sew it for her, please?

544
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,624
Oh, I've left my needle and thread
at the hospital, sweetheart.

545
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,790
Oh, this is a real mess, Lilly.
I've told you about amputations.

546
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:51,124
Now, you just watch them closely
and only chop if you have to, OK?

547
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:56,165
I wish I could cry like that.
I've forgotten how to.

548
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:58,374
Have another couple of drinks
and it'll all come back.

549
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,499
- Oh, aye.
- Well, that's serious medical advice.

550
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,332
Sometimes there's
nothing like a good skinful.

551
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,749
Stay the night, Alan.
The girls can double up.

552
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:12,249
Do you want me to ask him?

553
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,457
Lilly says you can get her ready
for bed tonight, Uncle Dicky.

554
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,582
- Now, that's a great honour.
- Lilly.

555
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,832
Dicky in the bed,
girls in the bunk, all right?

556
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,457
- Yes.
- Night-night, ladies.

557
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,082
Kiss Daddy night-night.

558
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,874
- Big kiss. Mm-mm!
- Aw...!

559
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,540
Night-night, night-night, sweetheart.

560
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,832
Come on, baby. There.

561
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:36,040
Come on.

562
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,124
You're a lucky bugger.

563
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,415
How did you get it all together?

564
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,332
You're so productive.

565
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:48,249
Reproductive. There's a difference.

566
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:53,415
Now, don't forget. I was always
jealous of you at university.

567
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,499
Organising the hops, hm?

568
00:43:56,025 --> 00:43:57,790
Mr Showbiz.

569
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:00,082
- Pulling girls.
- Failing exams.

570
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:03,082
Even that made me jealous.
I didn't have the guts to fail exams.

571
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,082
You're just trying to make me feel better.

572
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,290
Well, that's my job.

573
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:14,957
I only hung around with you
because you knew all the fast girls.

574
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:18,082
Yeah, but you married one of them.
You got one of them to keep.

575
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,582
I don't even have a home.

576
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:22,540
You drive around the city
and all you see are homes,

577
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:23,915
and I don't have one.

578
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,790
Oh, we've all got worries, you know.

579
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:29,999
I have this recurring nightmare about you
coming to date one of my daughters

580
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,832
in about ten years' time. It's awful.

581
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:35,207
Well, she will be old enough
to know her own mind, Colin.

582
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:39,249
Well, imagine, that little madam
wanting you to undress her tonight.

583
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,124
Six years old.

584
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,457
Night-night, Dicky.

585
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,915
Night-night, Lilly.

586
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,874
Er... will you be staying tomorrow night?

587
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,999
I don't think so.

588
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,165
Will you play me a record?

589
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,415
On the Saturday show. I promise.

590
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:51,332
Um... it's for Andrew,
but don't mention my name.

591
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,499
OK.

592
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,207
- Night-night.
- Night-night.

593
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:43,749
- What happened to the car?
- Ice-cream cones.

594
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,249
Take me home. I'm freezing.

595
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:48,082
How did you find me?

596
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,249
Oh, I tried you at home
and the rest was easy.

597
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,149
You're a dream, aren't you?

598
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:57,415
No, I'm real.

599
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,707
Touch me.

600
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,957
Feel me.

601
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,332
Sniff me.

602
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,790
I smell nice, don't I?

603
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:10,249
Even my sweat smells nice.

604
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,624
Take me home.

605
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,874
Oh, you wee bugger, you're not a dream.

606
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,832
Maddy, I'm...

607
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,124
Hi, Dicky Bird here.

608
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,124
My parties are going with a zing
this Christmas, and you know why?

609
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,082
It's new Party Mix,
the drink mixer for every taste,

610
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,999
in tangy, tropical four-fruits
or smoothie-tomato flavour.

611
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:55,582
Yes, gin, vodka and Bacardi
taste new and exciting with Party Mix.

612
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,415
Come in and join the crowd with Party Mix.

613
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,874
'Hey, Dicky darling, over here!'

614
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,540
Excuse me, folks. See you later.
Help yourself to the Party Mix.

615
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:07,374
<i>Party Mix, your new Party Mix</i>

616
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,040
Sorry, Alan. We'd like to go again.
We'll have to do a live mix, OK?

617
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,415
Clive says could you make it
a bit more suggestive at the end,

618
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,665
like you know you're going
to have a good time.

619
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,957
A good time. Lovely, thanks.

620
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,207
Mm-hm.

621
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,915
<i>...around me tight,
oh, Santa, hear my plea...</i>

622
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,415
<i>A message for you, Alan.</i>

623
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,999
<i>Santa, bring my baby back to me...</i>

624
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:36,707
A Mr Bruno Cullinari says he'll see you
outside the car park at six o'clock.

625
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:40,582
- Mr who?
- Bruno Cullinari? He was a bit weird.

626
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,415
Mm-hm. OK, thanks.

627
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:47,499
Alan? Bob Hope and Fred Astaire.
The doubles competition.

628
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,499
- I'm Bob Hope.
- Right.

629
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,415
I was actually more like him
when I was younger.

630
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:56,582
I've got a photograph.
Does photographs count?

631
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,040
Er... I'm not sure about that.

632
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:01,290
No, the rules are a wee bit hazy
on that score.

633
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,624
Now, look, this was taken in 1958

634
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,832
and everybody says
I was Bob Hope's double.

635
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,290
Surely that must go for something.

636
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:13,082
Er... yeah, well, look, Bob,
we'll let you know on that. Thanks.

637
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,374
Er... Mr Bird? Fred Astaire.

638
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:23,665
- Yes?
- Thank you for coming, Mr Bird.

639
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,874
Come on out. You're OK.

640
00:51:27,166 --> 00:51:29,540
It's a real treat to meet you, Mr Bird.

641
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:34,790
- That's my brother Paolo.
- How do you do?

642
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,921
That's Renato....

643
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:41,624
and I'm Bruno.

644
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,207
Come inside and meet Mr McCool.

645
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,665
Mr Bird, meet Mr McCool.

646
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,249
Mr Bird.

647
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,790
- I believe you know Mr Bunny.
- Oh, no, hardly at all.

648
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:36,457
No, I bought a 99 from him and, er...
we exchanged a few words.

649
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,290
Sit down, please, Mr Bird.

650
00:52:56,458 --> 00:53:01,207
Mr Bird, ice cream
is an old established business.

651
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:04,332
Everybody knows
where he stands in the city.

652
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:08,499
We all work together.
It's a kind of family.

653
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,082
That sounds nice.

654
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:15,957
Of course, everything works on trust.
Kind of unwritten rules.

655
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:20,207
A certain amount of honour is involved.

656
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,957
But Mr Bunny doesn't play by the rules.

657
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,207
- The unwritten ones?
- Yes.

658
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:28,249
The unwritten ones.

659
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,249
It's a territorial thing, really.

660
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,082
Other people work in the east,
in the south,

661
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:38,415
but we do business here in the north,
where we belong.

662
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:42,624
But Mr Bunny,
he's all over the place, Mr Bird.

663
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,707
He is an interloper.

664
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,332
He's like a rogue elephant,
wild, no rules.

665
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:53,040
Well, as I say,
we only exchanged a few words.

666
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,790
In fact I'm not even sure
if it was Mr Bunny himself.

667
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,832
No, no, no, there is no Mr Bunny, Mr Bird.

668
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:02,999
I told you, he's wild. He's a rogue.

669
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:06,540
No family, no heart.
Just a bunch of desperadoes.

670
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,707
Well, what's it got to do with me?

671
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,249
You must talk to him,
let him see reason...

672
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,290
before things get bad.

673
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:21,999
But they're bad already.
I mean, my car, the seats are ruined!

674
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,082
Have you ever tried to get
ice cream off velour upholstery?

675
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:01,749
My father says that things can
only get worse if you don't help us.

676
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:05,207
People do desperate things
when their livelihood is threatened.

677
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,249
For reasons of honour
and for other reasons,

678
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,249
we can't talk directly to Mr Bunny.

679
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,707
Everybody puts their faith in you.

680
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:15,415
My father says that he speaks for
the whole of the ice-cream community,

681
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,124
and my father asks
if he can call you Dicky.

682
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,540
My father says that ice cream is his life

683
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,540
and, er... he's called you Dicky again.

684
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:38,332
Call me Alan.
Yeah, my friends call me Alan, er...

685
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:42,040
Well, er... I'll do what I can.

686
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,915
Thank you for helping us.
I knew you would.

687
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,790
You came along just when we needed you.

688
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,540
The best machines for the best ice cream.

689
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,874
Ah, grazie, Renato.

690
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:10,957
A small early token
of our appreciation, Alan.

691
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,582
Gold Medal de luxe vanilla.

692
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,665
Of course, you can have
any flavour you like it.

693
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,582
Oh, no, that's... that's fine.
Vanilla is fine, yes.

694
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:22,290
And this is what Mr Bunny and people
like him want to deprive the people of,

695
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,957
a first-class ice cream. Please.

696
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,624
- Oh, thank you.
- Pleasure.

697
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,665
- Oh, and I wonder...
- Yes?

698
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,415
Could you help me out with a pint of milk?
I think I missed the shops.

699
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:34,624
Of course, of course.

700
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,499
Si, si.

701
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,582
Er... that's Archie and Amos,
two of my best men.

702
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:42,124
This is Dicky Bird from the radio.

703
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,665
Er... I'm Amos. He's Archie.

704
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,124
Bruno.

705
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,915
Oh. Ha.

706
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,249
Here. Let me pay for this.

707
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,915
Well, if you insist. It's 20 pence.
That's exactly what we pay.

708
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:04,707
Aye, 20p. Well, there you are. Thank you.

709
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,882
- Ah, Bruno?
- Si?

710
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:13,207
My father apologises
for speaking in Italian,

711
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,040
but he says
it's the language of his heart.

712
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,665
Oh, sure.

713
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:20,415
Well, er... cheerio and, er...

714
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,249
thanks for the milk
and the ice cream and, er...

715
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:25,082
Good night, Mr Bird. Thank you very much.

716
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,790
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

717
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,124
Good night.

718
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,374
- Good night. We'll keep in touch.
- Thank you.

719
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,832
Bye-bye.

720
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:49,415
Dicky? Dicky.

721
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:53,582
- Could I have your autograph?
- Oh, sure, sure, yes.

722
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:57,582
Have you got a... have you got a pen?
Right, lovely. What was your name again?

723
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,957
Er... could... could you make it to
"my dear friend Paolo"?

724
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:04,207
- To my dear friend Paolo, eh?
- Paolo.

725
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:06,874
That's a good Scottish name,
that, isn't it?

726
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,249
Dicky Bird.

727
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:12,040
"Tweet, twiddly, tweet."

728
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,082
- That's great.
- Lovely. OK?

729
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,332
- Right, thanks a lot.
- See you.

730
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,874
- Lovely car.
- Aye, thanks very much.

news for Bob Hope of Anniesland,

741
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,832
but, come on, Bob, keep trying.

742
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,132
Maybe you could practise
looking like somebody else, eh?

01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:21,165
And before I go today,
I just want to steal the airwaves

746
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,582
and just get a teensy bit serious.

747
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:27,915
I've got a message for someone
who might just be listening. Mr Bunny.

748
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,207
Or Miss Bunny.
I do want to talk to you again.

749
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:35,082
So, how about same time, same place?

750
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,540
Tonight. End of message.

751
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:42,915
And listen, everybody. One day soon,
I'm gonna tell you all about this.

752
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:48,082
Perhaps in a very special programme.
But until then I'm a man of mystery.

753
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,540
I'm afraid that tooth's very bad.

754
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,207
So, what we'll do, seeing it's you...

755
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:21,040
we'll put a dressing into it

756
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:23,415
and...

757
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:27,749
if there's no pain at all,
fix it on your next visit.

758

762
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,957
This is the reserve vehicle.
The rest are back at the body shop.

763
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:20,874
This is me completely out of action.
No more front-line units.

764
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,249
- I just wanted to have a word with you.
- I know that.

765
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,332
I was coming to see you.
What did you think I was doing?

766
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:27,749
- I thought you were trying to get away.
- Oh, God Almighty.

767
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:32,415
This is my first night on the Loganvale
estate. I was cleaning up here!

768
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,249
Let's have a look. Your radiator's OK.

769
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:38,124
I'll get the lads at the body shop
to beat this out for you.

770
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,749
Oh, no, no, no. I'll get it fixed.

771
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,665
No point hanging about here, is there?

772
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:46,290
Come on, follow me back to HQ.

773
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:25,249
'Hello, folks!'

774
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:31,582
You seen some action tonight, Trevor.
Was it a ramming job?

775
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:35,249
No, it was Robin Hood here
coming to rescue me.

776
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,749
'Hello, folks!

777
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,374
- 'Hello, folks!'
- Oh, you're, er...

778
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,040
Aye.

779
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,499
'Hello, folks!'

780
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,374
Oh, it's just superficial damage.

781
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,832
I'll get Roddy to bash it out
and slap some paint on it.

782
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,707
Oh, no, please. I'll fix it tomorrow.

783
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:05,124
Suit yourself. It'll cost you a fortune
to get it fixed anywhere else.

784
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,832
- Really?
- We can field two units tomorrow night.

785
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:11,624
- I've fixed up the freezer on the Merc.
- Oh, good, good. Well done.

786
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,165
- Listen, is Charlotte in the...
- She's in the office.

787
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:14,415
Right.

788
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,999
'Hello, folks!'

789
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,540
So, is this really
the ultimate driving machine?

790
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,415
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

791
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:31,624
Hello, folks!

792
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,332
Hello, folks!

793
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,790
'Hello, folks!'

794
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:54,290
Take a seat.

795
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,957
Mr Bird here wants to talk to us.

796
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,207
- He's seen McCool.
- Oh, yeah?

797
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:10,540
McCool wants to get together,
reach an agreement.

798
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,675
He's very upset.

799
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,624
I think it's a serious offer.

800
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,124
Oh, McCool's serious, all right.
He's deadly serious.

801
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:33,749
Do you have any idea
what you're getting involved in here?

802
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:38,165
- Do you work for McCool?
- Oh, certainly not. I'm a journalist.

803
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:41,165
I'm trying to stop senseless violence.

804
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,540
McCool runs a big outfit.
He wants to talk.

805
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:47,540
He wants to annihilate us,
that's what he wants.

806
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:51,249
McCool has got a stranglehold on
every operator in the north of this city.

807
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:55,332
He controls every franchise.
Wafer supply, ice cream, soft drinks.

808
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,915
He's even got a 10% mark-up
on every gallon of raspberry essence.

809
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,332
Now, you do your shopping elsewhere
and you got the demolition treatment.

810
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,874
How long have you been locked up
in that radio station of yours, Mr Bird?

811
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,957
Do you have any idea
what's going on around here?

812
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:15,749
Well, I got the impression that he wants
to try and find a working relationship.

813
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:19,082
Oh, yeah, exactly. Us working for him.

814
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:22,415
And you want me to tell those people
that you want them to work for McCool,

815
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,832
after the threats, the violence,
the day-and-night work here?

816
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:25,999
You go and tell them!

817
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:30,582
Well, something's got to be done.
It seems so stupid. It's almost like a joke.

818
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:34,540
People getting so angry about ice cream.
It's a joke.

819
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,415
And what deadly serious occupation
are you involved in, Mr Dicky Bird?

820
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,499
What exactly is
your contribution to humanity?

821
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:46,915
I want to help. But what can I do?

822
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,207
I want to help all of you find a solution.

823
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:09,749
You tell McCool this. We'll take
his ice cream, but under our conditions.

824
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:12,790
Every Mr Bunny's his own boss,
and that's the way it stays.

825
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:15,165
Now, we're talking equal prices
with no mark-ups.

826
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,207
And an open market in wafers.
We buy where we want.

827
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,624
If he prices fairly,
then he gets the business.

828
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,124
Now, on territories, we are willing
to negotiate openly around the table.

829
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:25,582
We talk under those conditions.

830
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,665
Where do you get your supplies from
at the moment?

831
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:31,790
So, that's what McCool's after.
That's why he sent you.

832
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:34,165
- He must be worried, Charlotte.
- Nobody sent me.

833
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:37,040
OK, well, you go back
to where nobody sent you from

834
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:41,290
and you tell them what we said,
we talk in an open market.

835
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,790
- OK.
- OK.

836
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:48,374
Now, you'd better go before
the boys get to work on your car.

837
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,790
You'll end up with a fridge in the back
and a set of chimes.

838
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,707
'Hello, folks!'

839
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,999
Charlotte? See Mr Bird off the premises.

840
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,165
Parlare italiano, er... non...

841
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,124
I speak English.

842
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,624
Oh, good.
Well, I'm on your side, Charlotte.

843
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,374
- You know that.
- Oh?

844
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,665
Well, I'm on... I'm on both your sides,
really, because what I think...

845
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:15,332
I think you should all be
on the same side.

846
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,207
'Cheerio, folks!'

847
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:22,915
I'd really like to see you again...
and get to know you better.

848
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,915
'Cheerio, folks!'

849
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:28,332
What's the matter? Don't people
date each other anymore?

850
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,582
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- 'Cheerio, folks!'

851
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:35,082
Mr Bird!

852
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:41,624
When you see McCool,
be sure and remind him.

853
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:45,665
Formerly Mr Softy. No more.

854
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:47,915
'Cheerio, folks!'

855
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:51,082
Here. Here's some ice cream for you.

856
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,124
Oh. Thank you.

857
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,207
'Cheerio, folks!'

858
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,624
Oh, in the name of...

859
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,290
Be finished in a minute, Dicky.

860
01:10:56,541 --> 01:11:00,082
<i>Munch them all day!</i>

861
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,499
'Thrifty Pops! Thrifty Pops!

862
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,124
'You just munch them all day.
They never stop.'

863
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,707
<i>Thrifty Pops! Thrifty Pops!
I want them now...</i>

864
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:36,249
Oh, hello, Mr Bird. Please come in.

865
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,665
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

866
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,457
Sit down. Have a cup of coffee.

867
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:46,707
A wee cake
or some chocolate biscuit, Alan?

868
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,332
- Yes, please.
- Maria.

869
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:54,374
Maria, what have you got left?
Any Kunzle cake?

870
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,999
Yes, I have two Kunzle cakes
and, er... some apple pie.

871
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:01,582
Oh, good, good, good.
Mr Bird and I will have the Kunzle cakes.

872
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,707
Some biscuit for the boys.
Oh, a wee slice of apple pie too.

873
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,874
There's a good girl.

874
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,332
I wanted some Kunzle cake as well.

875
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,540
Well, that's a pity, Bruno,

876
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:18,665
because you'll just have to have
some apple pie or a Yo Yo, won't you?

877
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:24,415
So, Alan, what did Mr Bunny
have to say for himself?

878
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,915
A lot. He wants to talk.

879
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,207
- I think it could work out good.
- Hm.

880
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,957
Where did you meet? His place?

881
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,332
Mm-hm. We went there, yes.

882
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,332
Where? Where is it?

883
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:42,540
Now, listen. I'm not taking any sides.

884
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:46,540
You asked me to help you talk
to Mr Bunny. That's all.

885
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,207
Hey, Bruno, please. Here, have this.

886
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:19,999
- Thanks.
- Bruno.

887
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,707
Give Alan his Kunzle cake.

888
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:32,582
Well, they have simple demands.

889
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,874
They want to do business with you,
that's obvious.

890
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,915
Who? Who's they?

891
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,874
I spoke with Trevor.
That's no secret, is it?

892
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,332
Trevor? Trevor, Trevor, Trevor!

893
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,415
My father says,
"Of all the most loathsome names,

894
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,415
"you have to mention that one,
the most abhorred name of all,

895
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:10,332
"the name of a two-timing,
interloping, fish-and-chip seller.

896
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,624
- "A name without honour."
- Yes.

897
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,207
"The name of a son
whose father turns in his grave

898
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,415
"to see the disgrace
that he brings to his family."

899
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:19,165
I don't understand.

900
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:23,582
Trevor's a Marinetti.
They have fish-and-chip shops all over.

901
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,124
We were close to them at one time.

902
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,624
Then Trevor started to drift into ice cream,
and he shouldn't have,

903
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,290
because there was a...
there was a kind of a...

904
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,540
Unwritten law.

905
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,290
Yes, an unwritten law.

906
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:38,124
Oh, dear God! What's this?

907
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,415
I forgot I was at the dentist today.

908
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:44,207
What else happened at Mr Bunny, Alan?

909
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,374
Ah, well, nothing much.

910
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,332
He wants to talk, that's for sure,
and, um...

911
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,540
and they gave me some ice cream,
just like you did.

912
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:54,665
Ah, they gave you some ice cream?
Some ice cream.

913
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,707
Bruno...

914
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:09,249
Si. Bravo, Papa. Si, si.

915
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:21,374
My father says that one taste of that
ice cream can answer many questions.

916
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,249
My father has the taste buds of a master.

917
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,332
He knows every ice cream in the country.

918
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,915
Paolo! Silenzio!

919
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,290
You're not having my ice cream, Mr McCool.

920
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:34,415
If you want one, there's a Mr Bunny van
every night up in Rosshall Park.

921
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:37,207
Alan, Alan, please come back.
Have another cup of coffee.

922
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,290
- Come on, please.
- Can I have your autograph?

923
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:42,499
Aye, sure, sure. Is that to Maria?

924
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,624
Just let me know
when you really want to talk.

925
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:47,415
I'll be happy to fix it up for you.

926
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,790
Ciao!

927
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,540
Bruno, no!

928
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,790
Stupido!

929
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:09,499
'It was announced in Moscow today

930
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:12,415
'that Mamie the giant panda
died in the night.

931
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:17,249
'Earlier this week, zoo officials were
rejoicing at Mamie's confirmed pregnancy,

932
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:21,124
'but a spokesman said today that tests
had revealed a serious stomach illness

933
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,415
'bearing similar symptoms to pregnancy.

934
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:26,165
'Messages of condolence have
been arriving at the Moscow Zoo

935
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,082
'from all over the world.

936
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,665
'The spokesman also said

937
01:16:29,791 --> 01:16:31,915
'that there would be early plans
to have Mamie stuffed

938
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,665
'and put on permanent display at the zoo

939
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:36,832
'as a lasting tribute to the generosity
of the People's Republic of China

940
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,707
'in gifting the animal
to the Russian people.'

941
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:58,957
And I'm saying this for any Mr Bunny who
may be listening. The message is urgent.

942
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,665
Mr McCool is on the trail.

943
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,707
Be prepared. Mr McCool is on to you.

944
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:08,290
So, please, same time, same place,
Mr Bunny, and I'll give you all the details

945
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,415
but in the meantime double the guards,

946
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,415
and send the women and children
to the hills.

947
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,332
'So, this is Dicky Worm,
your early bird, saying cheery-bye

948
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,832
'and don't forget, big prize day
tomorrow on the doubles match

949
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,499
'and the big prize this week
is a wee bitty special.

950
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:21,874
'It's one whole day's use

951
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,582

953
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,832
'he'll make sure that it's Boxing Day

954
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:31,874
'But never mind.
Finally, once again, Mr Bunny.

955
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,832
'If any Mr Bunny is listening out there,

956
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:37,165
'then please get the word
back to big Mr Bunny.'

957
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:41,790
- Gloria? I want to see Alan Bird.
- 'The McCools are on the warpath. Bye!'

958
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:44,332
Well, I told you. I'm on to something.

959
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,124
It'll break soon. I'll make a programme.

960
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:51,874
- Alan, you have not been yourself lately.
- Well, that's just the point.

961
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,332
I wasn't myself before, when I was myself,

962
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:57,332
but now I am myself, or very nearly.

963
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:00,207
- I don't follow you.
- I told you.

964
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:03,290
I'm changing. I had to.

965
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,915
My life was the wrong flavour.

966
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:09,999
My whole life was the wrong ice cream.
It needed a new flavour.

967
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,499
Ice cream?

968
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:15,165
You see, I was raspberry when I
should have been vanilla. Do you get it?

969
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:20,415
Alan, does, er...

970
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:24,124
Does this Bunny talk to you a lot?

971
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:27,290
Oh, I talk to them all. I see them all.
I'm helping them. They need me.

972
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,957
- Them all?
- Yes.

973
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,290
I needed to care for something,
to get involved.

974
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:33,165
You can ask my friend Colin.
He's a surgeon.

975
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:34,999
Mm-hm.

976
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:38,165
I've got a friend too, Alan,
who's a kind of a doctor.

977
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,915
Would you like to have a talk with him?

978
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,499
What about?

979
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,832
I think you should see someone soon, Alan,

980
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:46,415
someone who could help you find yourself.

981
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:50,624
Oh, do you mean a head psychiatrist?
Oh, you think I'm nuts. I'm not nuts!

982
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:55,540
Alan, before you go back on the air again,
I have to insist.

983
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,415
- Mr Swan?
- Bird.

984
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:16,124
Make yourself at home.
I'll be with you in a jiffy.

985
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:25,999
I wouldn't lie there.
That's another £20 an hour.

986
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,957
Oh. Ha-ha.

987
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:31,665
It's mostly used for group therapy
nowadays, anyway.

988
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,040
So, I hear you have
a friend called Mr Bunny?

989
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,165
Er... not a friend, no.
Somebody I'm helping.

990
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,707
I'm helping all of them,
all the Mr Bunnys.

991
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:50,207
How long have you been associating
with these Mr Bunnys?

992
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:53,249
All week, since Maddy left.

993
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:57,082
- Maddy?
- Yeah, my girl. She left me.

994
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,749
Yeah, we'd been together for four years.

995
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:01,540
It was... it was a bit of a shock.

996
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,832
How did that happen?

997
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,540
A removal truck came one night
and she left.

998
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:09,624
It was very sudden, yes, quite a shock.

999
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,832
How was your relationship with Maddy?

1000
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,290
Er... well, it was fine.
Well, I thought it was fine.

1001
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:18,332
Yes, I thought we were a very good team.

1002
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,290
Do you have a healthy sexual relationship?

1003
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:24,374
Mm, very healthy, I thought.

1004
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,207
Any abnormal sexual practices?

1005
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:33,249
No.

1006
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:36,582
- Nothing at all?
- No.

1007
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,790
- Any sexual violence?
- No, certainly not.

1008
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:42,540
Very well, we'll take your word for it.

1009
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:47,874
So, tell me, how do you feel
about losing Maddy?

1010
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,999
Heartbroken. It was a big shock.

1011
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:54,790
And I've had these dreams,
these awful depressing dreams.

1012
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:57,540
- Dreams?
- Yes, but now I see it's all for the best.

1013
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:00,249
I've already explained this to Hilary.
I think...

1014
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,707
I think that we've all got
to change at certain times.

1015
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,249
But if your life is like...
like an apple cake,

1016
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:08,207
when it should be like a Kunzle cake,
I think you're in trouble.

1017
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:10,124
I think you've got
to find the right flavour.

1018
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,082
Now, Maddy and I,
we were like a chocolate mousse.

1019
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:15,832
We were really terrific chocolate mousse,
but you can't live on chocolate mousse.

1020
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,499
No, you need other things.

1021
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,665
So, I... I do miss her, though.

1022
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:24,707
She was wonderful.

1023
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:29,207
We were some chocolate mousse.

1024
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,624
I wonder if you've ever done
any sailing, Mr Bird.

1025
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,124
No.

1026
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:43,624
I have a little illustration
that might be of some comfort.

1027
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,082
It goes back to my days in the Navy.

1028
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:49,582
They used to move us medicos
around a great deal, ship to ship,

1029
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:53,540
and they had this contraption
called a breeches buoy...

1030
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:54,915
Mm-hm.

1031
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:57,915
...and sometimes you could find
yourself out there on the ocean...

1032
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,415
Hanging on a piece of rope.

1033
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,874
There's nothing else around you
but the angry waters

1034
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,332
and you're stuck between here and there.
Oh, yes, I know, I know. You're right.

1035
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:07,915
How did you know that? That's my story.

1036
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,499
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's my story.

1037
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:13,124
It really happened to me.
Where did you hear it?

1038
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,415
Oh, I don't remember.
Maybe I read it in a book.

1039
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:17,415
No, you didn't.
I haven't written the book yet.

1040
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:20,290
- I'm sorry.
- This is very upsetting.

1041
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,457
It really happened, you know.
It really happened.

1042
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,957
I've got to warn the bunnies tonight.

1043
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:29,790
I think the McCools could be onto them.

1044
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:34,040
Listen. What about Maddy?

1045
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,582
It's only been four days now.

1046
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,124
I think you should take a little bit longer
than that to get over her,

1047
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,374
after all she meant to you.

1048
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,415
I don't think you're being fair.

1049
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:49,749
Don't worry. I'm still miserable.
I'll be miserable for ages, I know.

1050
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:54,249
But I can see the way forward now,
the ship on the horizon.

1051
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,832
- Hello, Miss Wilson.
- Hello, Doctor.

1052
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,665
- How are you?
- Fine, Doctor. Just a bit stiff.

1053
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,207
Well, I'll tell Sister you can have
a real bath today, then.

1054
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,207
Oh, thank you.

1055
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,999
I've brought someone to meet you.
It's Dicky Bird from the radio.

1056
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:17,165
- Oh...!
- A friend of mine.

1057
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:20,415
Very pleased to meet you, Dicky.
This is a real treat.

1058
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:22,957
I listen to you every morning here.

1059
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:27,499
I'm always awake first, and they don't
bring breakfast till half past seven.

1060
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,124
Well, thank you very much.

1061
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:32,415
I wish you did Saturday and Sunday too.

1062
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:34,874
They've got
that other noisy clown on then.

1063
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,415
- Oh, aye, Rufus.
- I don't like him.

1064
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:41,415
I don't like him much either.

1065
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,624
We'll have to go just now.

1066
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,415
Bye, Doctor. Cheerio, Dicky.

1067
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:49,540
You make an old lady smile every morning.

1068
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,040
Cheery-bye.

1069
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:55,374
- How long has she been in for?
- A couple of months.

1070
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,707
Oh, Jesus.

1071
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:01,232
No, she's OK. She's got you.

1072
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:07,040
Well, anyway, you've obviously got
a great deal to do

1073
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:09,790
and you shouldn't really be here
unless you're sick.

1074
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:13,082
- You're not sick, are you?
- Oh, no.

1075
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,082
Well, not really.

1076
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,665
Ah, well, I'll be seeing you, Colin.

1077
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:20,999
- Keep on taking the alcohol.
- Check.

1078
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,540
'Hello, folks!'

1079
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:48,290
Trevor. I'm glad you're here.

1080
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,124
- Did you get my message?
- What was that?

1081
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:54,165
McCool got ahold of your ice cream.
He reckons that he can track you down.

1082
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:57,832
I don't think he'll get too far.
You see, it's his own recipe.

1083
01:25:57,958 --> 01:26:00,249
- 'Hello, folks!'
- McCool's my father.

1084
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:06,249
I don't get it. What are you playing at?
You're all crackers.

1085
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,290
Nothing like a family feud,
Dicky, is there?

1086
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:11,040
Crazy people. You're all crazy people!

1087
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,040
You brought them here. You bastard.

1088
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:30,124
You're a dead man, Dicky Bird.
You are a dead man!

1089
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:56,082
Come on!

1090
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:58,374
Cheerio, folks!

1091
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:01,790
Bastard! Bastard!

1092
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,874
You bastard!

1093
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,040
Gonna have you!

1094
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,707
I'll have you, you bastard!

1095
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:24,707
Andiamo!

1096
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,665
They used me. They all used me.

1097
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:41,915
They could've picked up the telephone
if they'd wanted to talk to each other.

1098
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:45,082
And the girl, all along, it turns out
that she's McCool's daughter.

1099
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:48,332
- Do you want some eggs, Alan?
- Eh? No, thanks, Colin. No, thanks.

1100
01:28:50,916 --> 01:28:52,915
All the best fights
happen inside families.

1101
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:55,915
Yeah, that's what Trevor said,
shortly before he demolished my car.

1102
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:58,249
I just don't see any hope for the world.

1103
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:02,040
If people want to damage each other
over ice cream, we're doomed.

1104
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:05,415
I don't know.
I think ice cream's quite important.

1105
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,457
- Isn't it, girls?
- Yes.

1106
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,707
Did you, er... pay the milk this morning?

1107
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:13,832
- No, you paid him two weeks last week.
- I wasn't here last week, love.

1108
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,874
Oh, Colin, you said you were going to.

1109
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,915
I told you.

1110
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:22,124
Look, I hadn't got any cash
to pay him this morning.

1111
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,874
Are you remembering that Lilly's
got to be at her party at two o'clock?

1112
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,957
- Can you take her?
- Well, if I'm back, love, OK?

1113
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:33,415
- She's got two brothers, this girl?
- Yes, yeah.

1114
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:35,874
Well, that explains her rebellion, anyway.

1115
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,374
Well, that's what got McCool really angry,

1116
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,707
his daughter mixed up
with a fish-and-chip family.

1117
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,082
He's mortified.

1118
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:45,040
- Ice cream and chips.
- Oh, aye.

1119
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:47,540
Eh? Oh, no, no.

1120
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,665
No, it couldn't work.

1121
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:54,874
You said you'd get me
a request today, Dicky.

1122
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,040
Oh, goodness, so I did, Lilly.
I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'll fix it.

1123
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:01,249
I'll go into the station
right after I've had my breakfast,

1124
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:04,207
and, Rufus, he'll let me on
for a minute or two.

1125
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,999
You watch out for the ice-cream men, OK?

1126
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:09,290
Aye, but I've got to
do something about them.

1127
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:12,040
They're all so angry,
they can't think straight.

1128
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:14,415
Let me into the studio,
Rufus, just for one minute,

1129
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:17,749
to say hello to a kiddie and an old lady
that's in hospital, that's all.

1130
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:20,124
I'm sorry, Alan.
I'd have to clear it with Hilary first.

1131
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,082
I don't know what happened between
you two yesterday. I'd have to clear it.

1132
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:24,374
You're a shit, Rufus.

1133
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,374
I let you onto my show
on Mother's Day, do you remember?

1134
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,415
Just because you hadn't
phoned her for three weeks.

1135
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:31,040
Just give me the names
and I'll take care of it, OK?

1136
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:32,207
OK. Right, thank you.

1137
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:36,290
Well, this is to Andrew from Lilly,
but don't mention her name.

1138
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:39,582
And to a Miss Wilson
in the Western Infirmary.

1139
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:42,374
Just lots of love from me, OK? Thanks.

1140
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,207
- Which ward?
- Oh, I don't know which ward.

1141
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:48,249
I'll play them something nice, Alan.
No sweat, no sweat.

1142
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:50,124
No heavy metal, please.

1143
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,707
Well, after all that exercise,

1144
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:54,624
let's all sit down and think
about a nice fattening pudding.

1145
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,832
And here's Katie Pollock
with today's recipe.

1146
01:30:56,958 --> 01:31:00,165
It sounds delicious. Banana fritters.

1147
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:01,457
'Hello, everyone.

1148
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:05,749
'The Chinese are the acknowledged
masters in the art of fritter-making.

1149
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,707
'Everything from the humble
apple and pineapple fritters

1150
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:13,332
'to the rare and exotic
and difficult ice-cream fritter.

1151
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:16,457
'But today we'll concentrate
on the easy-to-make banana fritter,

1152
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:18,332
'a very delicious hot sweet

1153
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:21,457
'that'll make a change
from leftover Christmas pudding.'

1154
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:24,957
- She said ice-cream fritters.
- Sorry, Alan?

1155
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,124
Katie Pollock.
She said ice-cream fritters.

1156
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,457
Yeah, that's right, like baked Alaska.

1157
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:32,457
- How do you make them?
- Ask Katie Pollock.

1158
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:35,540
Er... but-but, I mean, well,
is she... is she a real person?

1159
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:38,665
I don't know if she's a real person,
but she's Hilary Sandeman's wife.

1160
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:42,040
'...baking the banana before frittering,
but I don't hold with that.

1161
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,832
'I think it's worth the extra effort...'

1162
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,415
Yeah, Hilary, much better.
Yeah, I feel fine.

1163
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,749
Yeah, I think everything's
going to work out fine. Yeah.

1164
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:50,749
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the angry scenes are subsiding. Yeah.

1165
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:52,415
No, I really phoned
about something else, Hilary. Yes.

1166
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:54,624
I wanted to speak to Heather.

1167
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,665
Do you know, I never realised
that she was Katie Pollock?

1168
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:01,124
Well, I wanted to ask her for a recipe.

1169
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,415
Mm, just a recipe. Mm-hm.

1170
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:06,707
Eh? No, no, I'm fine, honestly.
I'm fine, I'm cool. Everything's cool.

1171
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:10,249
Yeah, good shape, good shape.
But I do need a recipe from Katie.

1172
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:12,915
I mean Heather, and it's quite urgent.

1173
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,540
Look, I swear to you, Hilary,
I'm on top of the world.

1174
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:20,790
Yes, but, er...
it's a specific recipe. Ah...!

1175
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:02,082
- Trevor wants to see you.
- Oh, no, pal. No, you've got it wrong.

1176
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,707
No, I want to see Trevor.

1177
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:07,499
Oh, and, er... just one other thing.

1178
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:16,582
From now on, if anybody hits this car,
it'll be me and nobody else. Get in.

1179
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:59,332
So, it's gone about
as far as it can go, eh?

1180
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:01,040
Yeah.

1181
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:05,415
What does honour demand now? Hara-kiri?

1182
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:10,332
Listen, I just wanted to tell you, I don't
blame you for anything that's happened.

1183
01:34:11,455 --> 01:34:13,320
Thank you!

1184
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:16,082
Now, you and I are going to see Mr McCool.

1185
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:19,624
I've got something to say
to both of you. Fix it.

1186
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:22,040
- How?
- Phone the bastard.

1187
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:24,249
Or would you rather send a war party?

1188
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,374
Er... what do I say?

1189
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,457
Just tell him that I want to talk to him,
that's all. He'll turn up.

1190
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:41,874
'Hello, folks!'

1191
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:52,040
He's a weird old bugger,
picking a place like this.

1192
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:55,415
What did he say on the telephone?

1193
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:58,565
He said they do
a nice lemon-meringue pie here.

1194
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:03,090
What's the joke?

1195
01:35:09,945 --> 01:35:12,381
Oh, dear.

1196
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:18,042
Oh, dear.

1197
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,415
- Hello, Trevor.
- Hello, Uncle Luigi.

1198
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,915
- How's your mother?
- She's very well, thanks.

1199
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:36,457
Good, good. Have a sweetie.

1200
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,915
Can we get down to business,
Mr Bird, please?

1201
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:53,915
- You're Trevor's uncle?
- That's right.

1202
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:56,665
All the best families fight.
You know that, Mr Bird.

1203
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:58,665
Yes, I've heard that one a lot this week.

1204
01:35:58,791 --> 01:36:02,707
Only, I'm not family,
and neither is my car,

1205
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:07,374
and neither are any of all those
freedom-loving independent operators

1206
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,540
that you care about so deeply, Trevor.

1207
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:13,665
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance
to make it up,

1208
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:17,624
to me, to all those people
that you've duped into believing in you,

1209
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,290
and to yourselves.

1210
01:36:19,416 --> 01:36:24,999
You're going to work together on this,
a joint venture.

1211
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,582
What is it?

1212
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:29,999
Ice-cream fritters.

1213
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:46,832
Alan, you must be mad. Matto!

1214
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:50,790
You can't afford to laugh.
You're going to annihilate one another.

1215
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:52,832
Now, this way, you pool your resources.

1216
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:56,207
Your ice cream.
Your deep-fry shops. Your trucks.

1217
01:36:56,333 --> 01:37:00,957
You share a new product.
600 million Chinese can't be wrong.

1218
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:03,332
600 million Chinese!

1219
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:11,540
Here's the secret bit.

1220
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:21,707
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1221
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:28,707
And we create...

1222
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,207
a commodity...

1223
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:38,207
which we sell
at extreme profit to ourselves.

1224
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:40,290
Perfect, eh?

1225
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:28,707
Oh! Hot, and, er... and then it's cold.

1226
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:32,415
It's... it's interesting.
It's very, very interesting.

1227
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:34,915
It's bitter. It's sweet.

1228
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:38,707
Syrup. It needs syrup.

1229
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:41,832
But the syrup will be extra, on the side.

1230
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,165
Five, even ten pence a portion.

1231
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:47,624
I know, 30, 40 pence a fritter.
More maybe.

1232
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:52,624
More, definitely more.
It's a luxury item. It needs a royal name.

1233
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:56,290
- King Fritter.
- That's too obvious.

1234
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:58,707
Right, we've got to precook, freeze-pack,

1235
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:01,790
- and microwave at point of sale.
- Yeah.

1236
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:05,290
Hot ice cream, year-round sales,

1237
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:08,374
summer and winter - it's a miracle.

1238
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,290
It's a miracle!

1239
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:13,707
Hey, hey, hey... Slow down. You haven't
said if you liked it yet. Do you like it?

1240
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,790
- It's a winner, Dicky.
- Well done, Dicky.

1241
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:19,332
50-50 on the whole thing, Trevor.
Manufacture and sales.

1242
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:21,040
Paolo and I can handle the syrups.

1243
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:23,540
- Yeah.
- Maybe five or six flavours.

1244
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,915
Flavours! Good boy, Bruno, good boy.
You've got the syrups.

1245
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:27,874
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1246
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,957
Look, if you're talking business,
you ought to be talking to me.

1247
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:34,624
Don't you worry, Dicky.
We need a big campaign behind this one.

1248
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:37,540
We are revolutionising the market.
You can do the voiceovers.

1249
01:39:37,666 --> 01:39:39,040
No, no, you boys can run the show.
That's fine.

1250
01:39:39,166 --> 01:39:41,707
But, er... I'm in for, er... what?

1251
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:45,207
Er... 30 per cent off the top, hm?

1252
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:46,957
Yeah, you could call that a consideration

1253
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:49,540
for having thought up the whole
damned idea in the first place.

1254
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:53,082
And just in case you get any fancy ideas,

1255
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:55,707
you won't find this in any cookery book.

1256
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,082
This is the batter adhesive agent.

1257
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:00,665
Without this, you get
a sticky, gooey mess.

1258
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:04,665
The Chinese don't tell
everybody about this one.

1259
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:08,749
So, why don't we just visit a lawyer
first thing Monday morning

1260
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:11,915
and make this wonderful friendship legal?

1261
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:17,582
Oh, er... and just one other further
item of mutual company expenditure.

1262
01:40:17,708 --> 01:40:21,207
My car gets a new roof. OK?

1263
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,374
Yeah, sure, Dicky.

1264
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,832
OK, Dicky. Va bene.

1265
01:40:28,058 --> 01:40:29,707
No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1266
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,165
We need something short and sweet,
right? Bunnyfrits.

1267
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,915
No, McCool Bunny Fritters.

1268
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:38,624
Well, it's four o'clock on this lovely
peaceful Christmas afternoon,

1269
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:42,790
and this is Dicky Bird here,
being a very happy Christmas worm.

1270
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:45,749
You know, I got really sentimental
after the morning show today

1271
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:48,957
and I thought about poor old
Steve Kelly having to come in here,

1272
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:52,665
spend the afternoon away
from his lovely wife and happy kids,

1273
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:56,540
so bachelor boy Dicky volunteered
and here I am.

1274
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,332
You know, I must be crackers.
Matto. Crazy.

1275
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:03,415
But to tell you the truth, we are having
a pretty good time in Metrosound today.

1276
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:05,207
There's definitely a party atmosphere.

1277
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:08,957
We've got the food, we've got
the goodies, and the odd drink or two,

1278
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,957
so don't you feel too sorry for us.

1279
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:15,540
And anyway, Hilary Sandeman has
promised all us Christmas workers

1280
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:18,290
an extra four weeks' holiday
in the Caribbean

1281
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:21,582
as a means of compensation,
so that can't be at all bad.

1282
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,249
What an awfully nice boss Hilary is!

1283
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:27,457
So, I hope that you'll stay with us
and let us join your party

1284
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:31,957
or, if you haven't got a party of your own,
you come and join ours.

1285
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:39,124
So, cheers, everybody, in this great, big,
weird and wonderful city of ours,

1286
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,999
and, listen, folks, I'm not gonna tell you
what the time is today,

1287
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:45,624
or tell you what the traffic is doing,

1288
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:47,707
or tell you what's happening
with the weather.

1289
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:50,290
Oh, no, we're gonna have
a day away from all that.

1290
01:41:50,416 --> 01:41:54,915
I'm just gonna sit back, play you some
very nice music, talk my head off,

1291
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:58,665
and tell you some of the worst jokes
that you're ever likely to repeat.

1292
01:41:58,791 --> 01:42:01,165
So, in the meantime,
here's a little bit of music,

1293
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:03,874
while I tuck into my Christmas pud.

1294
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:07,207
Mm-mm.

1295
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:11,932
Merry Christmas, everybody.
God bless us, everyone.

1296
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,374
'Hello, folks, this is Dicky Bird

1297
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:06,415
'and I'm here to tell you that winter
will never be the same again.

1298
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:10,874
'From this Monday, exclusively from
all Mr McCool and Mr Bunny outlets,

1299
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,624
'you'll be able to enjoy
the new taste sensation, Frostihots,

1300
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,707
'a smooth and creamy ice cream
wrapped in delicious hot batter

1301
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:21,040
'and smothered
in your favourite fruity syrup.

1302
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:24,332
'Wow! And guess what? I invented it.

1303
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:27,665
'Yes, I tell you that once
my Frostihots reach the Eskimos,

1304
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:28,874
'they won't need igloos any more.

1305
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,790
'But right now, Frostihots are for you.

1306
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:33,874
'So, stop a Bunny or McCool van.

1307
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,040
'Ice cream will never be the same again.'

1308
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:39,415
'Sorry, Alan. We'd like to go again.'

1309
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:41,665
'Oh, shit.'
