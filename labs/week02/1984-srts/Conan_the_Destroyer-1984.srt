1
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:47,323
Between the years
when the oceans drank Atlantis

2
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,534
and the rise of the sons of Arius,

3
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,162
there was an age undreamed of,

4
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:57,041
when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.

5
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:01,504
Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian,
sword in hand.

6
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,674
It is I, his chronicler,
who knows well his saga.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,386
Now, let me tell you of
the days of high adventure.

8
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:40,681
- I think we made the merchant angry.
- Are you surprised?

9
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:44,435
- But we didn't steal everything he had.
- We didn't have time.

10
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:43,244
- Why aren't they trying to kill us?
- Maybe they want to capture us,

11
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,038
then torture us to death.

12
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,745
Conan, help!

13
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,088
- Do you know who I am?
- Taramis.

14
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,508
- Queen Taramis.
- Not my queen.

15
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:06,637
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.

16
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:09,348
The Cimmerians have no rulers.

17
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:12,309
You're a barbarian.
You live free in the world.

18
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,938
You owe allegiance to no one.
Is that not so?

19
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,649
It is and it always will be.

20
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:21,402
- What do you want?
- I need your help.

21
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,571
- No.
- No?

22
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,574
You don't know what I'd give you
if you help me.

23
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,368
You have nothing that I want.

24
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:34,915
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?

25
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:42,381
Look at the shrine.

26
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,967
See what you were praying for.

27
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,764
What is there, Conan?

28
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,807
Think.

29
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,732
Show me the desire in your deepest heart.

30
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,969
- Valeria!
- Where is this Valeria?

31
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,015
- With Crom.
- Your god.

32
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,518
She sits by the side of my god.

33
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:42,274
What I want, you cannot give me.

34
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,612
- Yes, I can.
- You can bring back the dead?

35
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,449
Do as I ask of you and I will.

36
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,622
Wake.

37
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:04,755
- And remember.
- Tell me what I must do.

38
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,217
Soon.

39
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,091
Conan! Look!

40
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,211
Doesn't that animal look familiar?

41
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:32,176
I think it does. I'm sorry about
what happened the last time.

42
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,817
They love us!

43
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,254
We will drink to Dagoth,
the dreaming god.

44
00:12:55,926 --> 00:13:00,347
- What do you want me to do for you?
- To bring back the woman you love?

45
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,516
Yes.

46
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:08,272
It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

47
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:12,443
that a woman child born with a certain
mark must make a perilous journey.

48
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:15,029
It is her destiny.

49
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:21,368
My niece Jehnna has such a mark.

50
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,790
- I want you to take her on that journey.
- To where?

51
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,584
Jehnna will show you.

52
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:33,964
From the day she was born,
she's been prepared for this.

53
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,053
There is a key she must find,
a key only she can touch,

54
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,723
as it was written in the scrolls of Skelos.

55
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,186
- Where is it?
In a castle.

56
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:51,190
- guarded?
- By a wizard called Toth-Amon.

57
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,777
- By a wizard?
- That frightens you.

58
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,696
You're afraid of magic.

59
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:01,158
And you will have to deal with it.

60
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,246
What good is a sword against sorcery?

61
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:09,417
- Then you're afraid to go?
- No. I will find a way.

62
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,130
- What does this key unlock?
- A treasure.

63
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,470
A jewelled horn. Only she can procure it.

64
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,224
Only she can lead you to it.

65
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:31,105
And when she has it,
you'll bring her back to me.

66
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,984
Then you will have your reward.

67
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:42,908
We shall both have everything we want...
through magic.

68
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,953
No!

69
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:50,583
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

70
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,795
- It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
- No, I saw...

71
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,506
A dream. Only a dream.

72
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,093
- Be still. Lie down.
I saw it.

73
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,930
I saw it again.
- No, you saw nothing.

74
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:07,725
A nightmare.
lmaginings out of excitement.

75
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,810
go back to sleep.

76
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,979
I saw it...

77
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:14,690
I saw it.

78
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:17,026
I did. I saw it.

79
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,570
Tomorrow you start your journey.

80
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:23,324
You'll need all your strength.
Your destiny is at hand.

81
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:27,578
Sleep.

82
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,166
Sleep.

83
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,253
All our destinies are at hand,
even Conan's,

84
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:40,299
- though he doesn't yet know it.
- We don't need him, my queen.

85
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:45,638
I don't need the captain of the guard
to steal a key. That is a task for a thief.

86
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:51,644
What I need you for is to see that this dear
child is returned safely to the palace

87
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:55,439
with both the treasure
and her virginity intact.

88
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,400
I will protect them both.

89
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:04,907
You'd better, my friend, for she must be
a virgin when she's returned to me,

90
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,494
so she can be properly sacrificed.

91
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:15,167
One other thing, Bombaata.

92
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,504
It is not wise to have the king of thieves
near the treasure.

93
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:23,259
So when the key is in my niece's hand,
I want your sword in Conan's heart.

94
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:27,430
Have the Elite guard follow. They will
strike at the right moment to help you.

95
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,306
Conan must die.

96
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:41,819
Do you think he's handsome?

97
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:45,531
Very ugly.

98
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:48,742
No, not him. Conan.

99
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,539
Can't you judge for yourself?

100
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:58,294
But how can I?
How many times have I seen a man?

101
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:01,130
A real man.

102
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,799
All I've seen is you.

103
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:10,931
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.

104
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,185
Yes. He is handsome.

105
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:57,186
Conan, wait! We must go this way.

106
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:00,564
- Not yet.
- But you have to obey me.

107
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,735
Weren't you told?
There are rules to every game.

108
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,780
I believe you.
But there's magic in this game

109
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,950
and I have to be able
to fight it with magic.

110
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,119
Akiro!

111
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:50,156
Crom!

112
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,117
- What are they going to do?
- Have lunch.

113
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:16,056
Those savages should thank me,
sparing them a terrible stomachache.

114
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:20,060
Why would they wanna eat someone
as old and as sour as you?

115
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:24,482
They thought if they digested me,
my magic would be in their blood.

116
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:27,359
At least they coulda washed you first.

117
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:52,134
I need you.
- I'm yours.

118
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,438
Tell me more about this key.

119
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:07,817
Oh, it's not an ordinary key. It's a jewel.

120
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:11,487
- A jewel?
- Yes. The Heart of Ahriman.

121
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,284
- Well, can it be worn?
- Only by me.

122
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,870
No one else dare touch it.

123
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,350
lf there is anything here that you like,
try not to take it.

124
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:26,604
I know when to steal and when not to.

125
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,717
Hit her. get her!

126
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:59,512
- What did she do?
- She came with bandits to raid us.

127
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:02,264
The others are dead. Now it's her turn,

128
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,934
after we have our fun with her.

129
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:08,646
Don't kill her too soon!

130
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:12,650
- Save her!
- Thieves should be hanged.

131
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,698
Conan, there are six of them against her.

132
00:22:20,699 --> 00:22:24,537
One, two, three... I think you're right.

133
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:27,248
And she's tied to the stake.

134
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,834
Do something!

135
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,061
Stop.

136
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:07,199
I think we made a friend.
- Wait here.

137
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:30,431
What do you want?

138
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:32,850
- To come with you.
- Be off!

139
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:39,523
- Let me speak to Conan.
I said be off.

140
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:51,971
Stop!

141
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:58,519
Leave.

142
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,733
I swear that if Conan will let me ride
with him, I will give my life for him.

143
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:12,366
We shall see.

144
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,865
The castle of Toth-Amon. It holds the key.

145
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:11,509
Come bring her, Conan.

146
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:17,807
- We leave now.
In the morning.

147
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,020
- I'm the leader here.
- Lead in the morning.

148
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,898
It will be better. We must rest.

149
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:28,275
My thinking exactly.

150
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:31,941
Sleep.

151
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:38,197
ln the morning you will touch
the Heart of Ahriman.

152
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:41,033
The first to do so in a thousand years.

153
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:12,481
Look!

154
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,739
Jehnna... Jehnna!

155
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,993
Jehnna!

156
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:35,379
Akiro, where is she?

157
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,719
ln there!

158
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:46,932
- Who took her?
- A giant bird.

159
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:49,935
A bird of smoke.

160
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:54,315
lnto the boat!

161
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,777
Somebody should stay
and watch the horses.

162
00:31:57,902 --> 00:31:59,862
Malak!

163
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:02,448
I didn't mean me.

164
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:07,745
I'm rowing!

165
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:39,860
Too late, my friends.

166
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:44,448
But come... come anyway.

167
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:43,299
How do we get in?
Is there another entrance?

168
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:57,938
Under here is a way in.

169
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:02,693
- You mean under the water?
- You can stay here if you like.

170
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:08,699
Alone?

171
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,764
They need me.

172
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:05,626
Bombaata.

173
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:56,195
Wizard it open.

174
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:26,308
Fine magician you are.
go back to juggling apples.

175
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,955
get up! get him!

176
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:05,778
That's exactly what I would have done.
Exactly.

177
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:54,452
There are only two left, wizard,
and you're behind one of them.

178
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:58,122
Which one?

179
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:00,458
- No! Not here!
- It's us!

180
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:05,189
Bombaata.

181
00:45:06,857 --> 00:45:08,109
Bombaata!

182
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,573
Bombaata!

183
00:45:17,243 --> 00:45:18,869
Bombaata!

184
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:22,456
I need you!

185
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:24,875
Bombaata!

186
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:29,755
- Bombaata...
- It's all right.

187
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,024
Crom!

188
00:46:50,002 --> 00:46:52,838
Out! Out of here quick!

189
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:55,466
- Hurry, hurry!
- Quick! Out!

190
00:47:43,347 --> 00:47:45,391
Bombaata!

191
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,121
All an illusion.

192
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:46,619
Help! Bombaata, help me!

193
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:49,497
Bombaata, where are you?

194
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:52,583
Put me down, do you hear me?
Put me down!

195
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,669
Look out, you fool!

196
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,353
Bombaata, stop!

197
00:52:02,106 --> 00:52:05,609
- Why?
I thought you were going to hurt the girl.

198
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:19,415
This is one of the queen's guards.

199
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,501
- Why did they attack us?
- Not by her order.

200
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:12,384
Wait, wait. This is much better.
Akiro's own magic mixture.

201
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:15,679
Let me help you.

202
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,251
- What do you think you're doing?
- Covering your wound.

203
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:47,670
My wound is lower.

204
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:50,881
We don't want an infection to spread.

205
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:53,217
I'll spread your head open.

206
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:00,975
Is this what the world has come to?

207
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,522
You try to help somebody
and what do you get instead of thanks?

208
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:10,234
Threats.

209
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,664
Now, yell if it hurts.

210
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:33,257
I suppose nothing hurts you.

211
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:35,634
Only pain.

212
00:54:36,844 --> 00:54:41,223
After we return to Shadizar,
what will you do?

213
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:46,771
I'll find my kingdom
and a queen to sit beside me.

214
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:53,319
What kingdom?

215
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:56,447
The promise I was kingdomed.

216
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:58,741
No...

217
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:01,535
The kingdom I was promised.

218
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:11,587
- What queen?
- Valeria.

219
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:18,844
- Valeria...
- Valeria.

220
00:55:20,763 --> 00:55:25,226
What is she like, this... Valeria?

221
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:31,190
Do you see this woman over there?

222
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:36,487
- Zula?
- Valeria is like her.

223
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:43,369
She doesn't look like her,
but she has the same... spirit.

224
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:50,126
The same... The same...

225
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:52,503
Strength?

226
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:55,714
Strength. Strength.

227
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,134
And she's a warrior too?

228
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:00,719
A great warrior.

229
00:56:02,012 --> 00:56:04,056
A great woman.

230
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:09,228
Could there ever be...
anyone else but her?

231
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,273
Another queen?

232
00:56:12,857 --> 00:56:15,234
Lot on your knife.

233
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:20,197
Not on your life.

234
00:56:25,703 --> 00:56:29,415
Excuse me. I must get up now.

235
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:52,146
How do you feel?

236
00:56:53,064 --> 00:56:55,316
Welcome.

237
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:58,861
You are welcome.

238
00:57:00,821 --> 00:57:03,616
I didn't know women could be warriors.

239
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:06,118
All my tribe are warriors.

240
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,332
Well, it seems that
men like women warriors.

241
00:57:11,457 --> 00:57:13,501
Some.

242
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:18,464
Do you think that I could ever be one?

243
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:22,676
I could teach you how to use this.

244
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:27,515
Yes. Please.

245
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:34,063
Now, the power is in the wrists.

246
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:36,649
Oh, I see. Like this?

247
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:40,653
That's right. They've got to stay loose.

248
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:43,197
It takes practice and strength.

249
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,200
Wait!

250
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:48,994
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

251
00:57:50,496 --> 00:57:52,540
Hold on.

252
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:58,421
lf you're going to learn how to fight,
then learn with a real weapon.

253
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:00,923
Not with a toothpick.

254
00:58:02,091 --> 00:58:05,886
Here. I'll show you. Stand like this.

255
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:13,394
Yes. You do it. Try it.

256
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,896
And then swing it over your head.

257
00:58:17,523 --> 00:58:20,151
I'll help you. Swing over your head.

258
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:24,321
good.

259
00:58:25,865 --> 00:58:28,951
Now you're ready to take on anybody.

260
00:58:53,684 --> 00:58:56,145
How do you attract a man?

261
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,648
What I mean is...

262
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:03,944
suppose you set your heart on somebody,

263
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,197
what would you do to get him?

264
00:59:06,322 --> 00:59:09,116
grab him! And take him!

265
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:13,162
You'd grab him and... and take him?

266
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:17,249
Take him, like that!

267
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:28,511
- What did she mean?
- What did she say?

268
00:59:28,886 --> 00:59:34,850
Well, she said that if she wanted a man,
she'd reach out and take him.

269
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,686
good idea.

270
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:43,484
But then what? I mean, you've got him.
What do you do with him?

271
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,363
That's easy. You see, you just...

272
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:50,199
You...

273
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,579
You see, in order for a man
to really know a woman

274
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,543
and for her to know him, they have to...

275
01:00:02,128 --> 01:00:04,797
they have to... to join.

276
01:00:06,424 --> 01:00:07,925
Join?

277
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:14,265
get together.

278
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:19,103
You see, he has to take his... his...

279
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:23,649
and grab her by the...

280
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,362
There you are, joined.

281
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:30,990
I mean, how do you think flowers grow?

282
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:43,586
- Through this?
- Yes.

283
01:00:43,711 --> 01:00:46,672
Is this the only way?
- Yes.

284
01:00:47,214 --> 01:00:51,385
- We can't go around it?
I go where I feel myself led.

285
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,971
So I've noticed.

286
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,257
That way.

287
01:04:21,262 --> 01:04:25,224
Shouldn't one of us
go back and stand guard?

288
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,024
Bombaata.

289
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:20,071
Together.

290
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:57,483
Here, let me help.

291
01:06:00,111 --> 01:06:03,656
Malak, go inside and see if there's a lock.

292
01:06:03,781 --> 01:06:06,158
- You mean in there?
- go!

293
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:27,596
I found something. Let go. Easy.

294
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:50,346
''It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

295
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:55,893
that the horn will be
found by a woman child.''

296
01:07:56,727 --> 01:08:01,774
''A virgin, who will have a mark upon her.''

297
01:08:13,953 --> 01:08:22,253
''And when the horn is placed once more
in the forehead of the dreaming god,

298
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:25,589
Dagoth will arise.''

299
01:08:25,714 --> 01:08:29,343
''Then let men fear.''

300
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:32,638
''Death to the world.''

301
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:38,811
''The woman child will be sacrificed.''

302
01:09:17,975 --> 01:09:20,853
- Stop her!
- Be silent!

303
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:00,476
Crom!

304
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:11,964
Death to the world.

305
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,550
Life for Valeria.

306
01:11:20,306 --> 01:11:23,142
The girl's destiny isn't only
to deliver the horn.

307
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:25,686
It's just writing on a wall.

308
01:11:25,811 --> 01:11:28,647
She is to be killed. Sacrificed.

309
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,902
We shall see, destiny or not.

310
01:11:34,945 --> 01:11:37,323
Everybody out!

311
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:39,575
Out!

312
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:43,329
Wait! It's worth a fortune!

313
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:25,037
- We come in peace.
- Then let us go in peace.

314
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:31,752
Let the girl come forward.
We've been waiting for her all our lives.

315
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:37,091
We are the keepers of the horn.
It belongs to us.

316
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:39,510
No longer.

317
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,929
- Who are you?
- Conan.

318
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:44,765
I have heard of you.

319
01:12:53,065 --> 01:12:56,235
Do you know the legend
written on the wall of the crypt?

320
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,404
From the day of my birth.

321
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:01,741
Then you know what will happen
if the horn is placed back

322
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:04,702
in the forehead of Dagoth.

323
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,037
The god will live again.

324
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:13,294
And we who give him life will stand by his
right hand and rule the world with him.

325
01:13:13,419 --> 01:13:17,715
You will die in the great evil
that will come from his rebirth!

326
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,052
- We will control him.
- No one is able to control him!

327
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:25,681
His power and his evil are too great!

328
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:28,184
give us the girl or we'll take her!

329
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:30,561
Enough talk!

330
01:14:00,382 --> 01:14:02,718
Back to the crypt!

331
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:55,271
Bombaata, get out!

332
01:14:56,522 --> 01:14:58,774
Out! Let's get out of here!

333
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:38,314
Behind the dragon there's a tunnel.
It could be our only way out.

334
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,691
The jewel. Take the jewel.

335
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:44,028
Hurry, hurry.

336
01:15:48,115 --> 01:15:50,159
That way.

337
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:59,835
Malak! Malak, come on!

338
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,382
Malak!

339
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:40,251
It's the leader. He's a wizard.

340
01:16:50,302 --> 01:16:55,433
- He's forcing the mouth open.
- Well, stop him. Kill him or something.

341
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:02,022
- My dagger is gone. You kill him.
- Not me. It's bad luck to kill a wizard.

342
01:17:02,148 --> 01:17:06,360
Wait. There is a better way
to take care of a wizard.

343
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:42,438
Well done, Akiro.

344
01:17:43,481 --> 01:17:45,733
lnto the tunnel.

345
01:18:00,748 --> 01:18:03,667
Don't stop. Hurry! Hurry!

346
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:51,108
Run! Run!

347
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:02,620
- Where are the others?
- They're coming. Don't worry. go!

348
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:43,369
- They've gone.
- Taken their horses.

349
01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:45,621
Or been captured. Let's flee.

350
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:48,165
Wait.

351
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,751
Bombaata took her.

352
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:55,339
Taramis planned it from the beginning.

353
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:59,552
We get the horn, her guards will kill us,

354
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:02,847
and Bombaata takes the girl
and the horn back to her.

355
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:07,435
- And her promise to you?
- A lie.

356
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:17,737
- Where are we going?
- To Shadizar.

357
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:20,948
- What for?
- To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.

358
01:21:21,073 --> 01:21:24,952
But it's her destiny. It can't be stopped.

359
01:21:25,077 --> 01:21:27,621
- You don't have to come.
I will.

360
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:30,207
I will.
I won't!

361
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:32,793
I mean, what's in it for us?

362
01:21:34,086 --> 01:21:38,174
What are we? Some charitable
institution? We're thieves!

363
01:21:38,299 --> 01:21:40,760
go! I won't help!

364
01:21:51,312 --> 01:21:53,147
Hey!

365
01:21:53,272 --> 01:21:57,401
Hey, wait for me!
You know you can't do without me!

366
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,154
Wait, Conan, wait!

367
01:22:21,884 --> 01:22:24,345
Do you have the treasure?

368
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:38,984
Bring it to me.

369
01:22:57,711 --> 01:22:59,755
Reserves to guard the palace.

370
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,718
There must be hundreds of them
around it. We can't get in there.

371
01:23:03,843 --> 01:23:06,303
Well, you can't say we didn't try.

372
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:12,143
- The front gate can't be the only way in.
- Oh, it isn't...

373
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,228
Malak?

374
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:28,284
At the bottom, behind the waterfall,
there's an entrance.

375
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:32,288
It used to be an exit. My cousin's sister's
brother dug his way out there,

376
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:35,458
when he was a prisoner in Shadizar.

377
01:23:57,271 --> 01:24:01,609
Today is your birthday.
All of Shadizar is celebrating.

378
01:24:03,194 --> 01:24:05,237
Drink.

379
01:24:09,533 --> 01:24:12,328
To life. To Dagoth.

380
01:24:12,953 --> 01:24:15,206
To Dagoth.

381
01:24:48,739 --> 01:24:52,243
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

382
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:05,089
My cousin's sister's brother
never said anything about bars.

383
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:07,174
How do we get back up?

384
01:25:07,299 --> 01:25:11,512
The bars were put up after
your sister's brother's cousin escaped!

385
01:25:11,637 --> 01:25:15,516
Cousin's sister's brother. How many
times do I have to tell you that?

386
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:20,396
- You said your sister's brother's cousin!
- Who cares who it is?

387
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:23,107
What difference does it make?

388
01:25:49,175 --> 01:25:53,596
At the first sign of life in our god,
the girl must be sacrificed.

389
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:58,434
Or, as the scrolls of Skelos say,
a catastrophe will befall us.

390
01:26:44,522 --> 01:26:48,359
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

391
01:26:48,484 --> 01:26:50,986
Power above all power.

392
01:28:41,055 --> 01:28:43,307
Kill her!

393
01:28:45,101 --> 01:28:47,353
Save the girl!

394
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:37,027
Kill her! Kill her! She must be sacrificed.

395
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,444
No!

396
01:30:36,962 --> 01:30:39,006
get back!

397
01:31:00,027 --> 01:31:02,530
Down the steps!

398
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:41,652
No!

399
01:32:03,299 --> 01:32:04,717
Run!

400
01:32:44,715 --> 01:32:49,136
His horn is his life! Tear out the horn!

401
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,853
Zula.

402
01:35:14,532 --> 01:35:17,159
I need a captain of the guards.

403
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:21,038
I see no reason why a woman
wouldn't do as well as a man.

404
01:35:38,055 --> 01:35:40,850
- You.
- Me?

405
01:35:40,975 --> 01:35:43,227
Come here.

406
01:35:49,275 --> 01:35:52,653
I understand that every king or queen
must have a fool.

407
01:35:56,282 --> 01:35:59,660
- Do I qualify?
- More than qualify.

408
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:15,509
Will the world's greatest
wizard come forward, please?

409
01:36:20,014 --> 01:36:22,266
At your service.

410
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:27,063
One cannot rule without wisdom.

411
01:36:27,188 --> 01:36:30,816
- Let me instruct you in the fine art of...
- Later.

412
01:37:02,681 --> 01:37:05,309
Rule Shadizar with me.

413
01:37:05,434 --> 01:37:08,979
I will have my own kingdom,
my own queen.

414
01:37:54,233 --> 01:37:58,487
So it was that Conan
mourned his lost Valeria.

415
01:37:58,988 --> 01:38:02,283
At length, he sought adventure
in distant lands

416
01:38:02,408 --> 01:38:08,330
and trod the jewelled thrones of
the earth beneath his sandalled feet,

417
01:38:08,456 --> 01:38:12,918
until at last he found his own Kingdom

418
01:38:13,044 --> 01:38:16,338
and wore his crown
upon a troubled brow.

419
01:40:23,174 --> 01:40:44,907
