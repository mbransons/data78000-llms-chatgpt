00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,900
Hi.
Julie Schofield.

2
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,400
Hello.

3
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,300
That thing does work properly,
does it?

4
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh, it works just fine.

5
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,800
I want my words
preserved for posterity.

6
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,500
I won't miss a thing.

7
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
Drink?
Thanks very much.

8
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,800
No bourbon, I'm afraid. Scotch.

9
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,300
Scotch would be great.

10
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
Ice?
Mm-hm.

11
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, of course.

12
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm afraid so.

13
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,300
I've always wanted fame.

14
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,900
I've always liked the idea
of my name going down in history.

15
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,900
Going down as a spy for Russia?

16
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,300
Fame or infamy -- what does it matter?

17
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
I shan't be forgotten.

18
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,600
If my mother could only see me now.

19
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,900
The last of the few.

20
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,100
It really was only a few?

21
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh, there were plenty of people
waiting to see which way to jump.

22
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,900
Things only had to go a little
differently and...well, you know.

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
But, yes, in practice
we were just a few.

24
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
A happy few.

25
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
"A band of brothers."

26
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,100
Shakespeare. 'Henry V'.

27
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,700
Our most patriotic king.

28
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,400
How big a band were you,
this band of brothers?

29
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,800
Some things have to remain secret,
even now.

30
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,400
You sure?

31
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,700
Certain, no less.

32
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Background, dear lady,
is all I can give you.

33
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,400
The whole delightful, utterly
despicable English background.

34
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
Well, I understand
the delightfulness, alright,

35
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,900
but not why you had to despise it.

36
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,600
How someone of your class
and, well, background...

37
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,300
Should want to kick it in the teeth?
Precisely.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,200
You have no idea what life in England
in the 1930s was like.

39
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Treason and loyalty,
they're all relative, you know.

40
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Treason to what?

41
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,600
Loyalty to whom?

42
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,100
That's what matters.

43
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
.. I vow to thee,
my country

44
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,000
.. All earthly things above

45
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,500
.. Entire and whole and perfect

46
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,600
.. The service of my love

47
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,100
.. The love that asks no question

48
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,700
.. The love that stands the test

49
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
.. That lays upon the altar

50
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,800
.. The dearest and the best

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,800
.. The land that never falters

52
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,800
.. The love that pays the price

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,900
.. The love that makes undaunted

54
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,700
.. The final sacrifice

55
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,500
.. And there's another country

56
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,900
.. I've heard of long ago

57
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,800
.. Most dear to them that love her

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,700
.. Most great to them that know.....

59
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
.. We may not count her armies

60
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,400
.. We may not see her king

61
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,100
.. Her fortress
is a faithful heart.....

62
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
.. Her pride is suffering.....

63
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,100
.. And soul by soul and silently

64
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,100
.. Her shining bounds increase

65
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,900
.. And her ways
are ways of gentleness.....

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Martineau! Robbins!

67
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,600
.. And all her paths are peace...

68
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,700
They shall grow not old
as we that are left grow old.

69
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

70
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,700
At the going down of the sun,

71
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,900
and in the morning,

72
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
we will remember them.

73
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,100
We will remember them.

74
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Want to come and have lunch?
My parents are down.

75
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
That's very nice of you. Thanks.

76
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,100
You were laughing.
I was not.

77
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,000
Giggling, then.
I didn't utter a sound.

78
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
You were giggling silently.
I couldn't concentrate at all.

79
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Even a crusty old Tory like you,
Devenish,

80
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,500
must see it's absolutely ludicrous

81
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,100
for 400 boys to line up and blub
for people they never knew.

82
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,900
What do you mean, didn't know?

83
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,500
Who died in a businessman's war

84
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,300
because they were too stupid
to shoot their superior officers

85
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,300
and start a revolution
like the Russians.

86
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
They were the superior officers,
weren't they?

87
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,000
We could all see
who YOU were thinking about.

88
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,400
Wharton! Wharton!

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
A glass of sherry?

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,700
Yes, Barclay?
Take these round to all the Houses.

91
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,900
I want one on every noticeboard
before lunch.

92
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Yes, Barclay.

93
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,300
What you forget
is all those people died for us.

94
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,800
They died for their class.
You are their class.

95
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,500
It's silly to pretend you're not.

96
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
You're always
trying to be different.

97
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
What's wrong with being different?
There you are.

98
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,200
I mean, you want to be elected
to be a God, don't you, Devenish?

99
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,300
Yes.
They're different.

100
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
That's not what I mean.

101
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,600
You wait.

102
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
My waistcoats are going to be
the most different you've ever seen.

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Why an intelligent person like you

104
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,300
should want to be part
of a self-perpetuating oligarchy...

105
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,300
It's a pity you have to be a prefect
before you can be elected,

106
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
else I'd be wearing one now.

107
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,500
You'll make it. Menzies will see to
that. Will I? That's the question.

108
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,100
I expect so.

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Would you like to do the honours?
Yes, of course.

110
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Well, I must say I think
that's the best service yet.

111
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes.

112
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,700
Boys! Have any of you seen Martineau?

113
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Bennett, do pull yourself together.

114
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,200
It's not even
as though he was there.

115
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Not yet.

116
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,300
Any moment now,
the great oak doors of Longford

117
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,400
will swing open
on their rusty hinges...

118
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,600
That door does need oiling.

119
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,100
..and the glorious vision
will step forth.

120
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,500
He'll stand a moment, winsomely
framed in the tumescent archway.

121
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Doing what?

122
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Sniffing the wind.

123
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Like a dappled deer.

124
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh, my God.

125
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,100
And then... then he'll shoot
a tender yet burning,

126
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
soft yet passionate glance

127
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,200
across the 300 yards of sacred turf,

128
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,600
hoping against hope
that I shall be there to receive it.

129
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
Hmm.

130
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
And I shall lay my heart at his feet.

131
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Must have enormous feet
if they'll stretch from Longford's to here.

132
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,300
They are. Want a peek?
Thank you, no.

133
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,700
You seen Martineau?

134
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,100
No, I only have eyes for one person
in the entire world.

135
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,100
Any of you?
Probably with his parents.

136
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,100
I don't think that they came down.

137
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,500
Still, never mind. Thanks.

138
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,800
No, thank you
for the good-humoured restraint

139
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,700
with which you exercise your power.

140
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,700
It's not only not fair,
it's not even sensible.

141
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
Come on, Judd.

142
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,600
Our parents spend hundreds of pounds
sending us here to be educated

143
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,000
and we spend the entire time
playing games.

144
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Quite right too.
Games are good for Bolsheviks.

145
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Teach you a bit of team spirit.

146
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,700
You could be good at cricket
if you'd try.

147
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
I don't want to try. I want
to be left alone to do my work.

148
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,300
I hope you're not taking those
bio notes out of House, Bennett.

149
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,100
Then you hope in vain, Fowler.

150
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Farcical's given me permission
to use them for nature study.

151
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,300
Who?
Farcical.

152
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
If you mean the Housemaster,
kindly use his proper name.

153
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
You didn't.
What?

154
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,600
Use his proper name.

155
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,300
His proper name is Mr Farquharson.

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,100
Are you trying to be clever?
I don't have to try. I am clever.

157
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I've half a mind
to ask for permission to beat you.

158
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,500
You've half a mind,
we agree on that.

159
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Quiet!

160
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,900
Get changed, everybody.

161
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Anyone late for the House matches

162
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
will be up before Barclay
for six strokes.

163
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,300
Ooh!

164
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,300
What you have to grasp, Devenish,

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,600
is that Fowler is precisely what
this school was designed to produce.

166
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Not empire builders. Dear me, no.
Building empires needs imagination.

167
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,100
Empire ruling.
Oh, do dry up.

168
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,700
Fowler will go straight from
the King's African Rifles

169
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,300
into the Colonial Service.

170
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
He'll end up with an OBE.
And syphilis.

171
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,700
Bennett, do you mind?

172
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,300
He'll catch it off a little native girl

173
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,900
who he'll visit after dark
in her steamy primeval hut.

174
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,200
When he gets back to his mildewed wife
in Bexhill-on-Sea,

175
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,100
he won't be able to look at her
so he'll turn her over...

176
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,700
For heaven's sake!

177
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Serves her right for marrying
an imperialist and an exploiter.

178
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,500
There's nothing wrong
with the Colonial Service...

179
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
"It's a perfectly decent career."
Shut up!

180
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,100
There is nothing decent
about colonialism.

181
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,900
I don't see why
you have to be against everything.

182
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not. I'm FOR revolution.

183
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,800
Alright, everyone!

184
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,700
Umpires for Longfords
versus Chancellors?

185
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,000
Me, please. Me and Judd.

186
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
Alright.

187
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,700
I don't want to go and umpire.
Yes, you do. Come along.

188
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,200
Umpire!

189
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,200
Umpire, that was a wide.

190
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,800
No, it wasn't.

191
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
I couldn't possibly
have reached that.

192
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,400
Course you could. You just didn't try.

193
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,400
It was practically
outside the white line.

194
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Are you arguing with the umpire?

195
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Because arguing with the umpire
is not school practice.

196
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,800
It might be in your House
but it isn't in ours.

197
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,600
Since we beat you last week,
you can shut up.

198
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Play!

199
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,800
Howzat?!

200
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,300
Out!

201
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
We should have rung
the muffled peal after the dedication.

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,900
I don't see why we didn't.
Because we're not good enough.

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,500
You don't have to be good
to run a muffled peal. It's muffled.

204
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
No-one can really tell.

205
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,300
I'll muffle you if you don't shut up.

206
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,600
Out! You lot -- go! Out, all of you.

207
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,300
Spungin, you get a master. Now!

208
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,700
Jesus, God! Did you see?
That was Martineau.

209
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
This place.

210
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
This place!

211
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
These things
should be left to the Gods.

212
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,200
He'd never have done it if he hadn't
been sent to see the headmaster.

213
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,700
He knew that meant expulsion.

214
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes, but once a master caught him,
Delahay, it was out of our hands.

215
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,400
Especially as it was
with a man from another House.

216
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,800
The Gods could have dealt with it.
That's what we're here for.

217
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
Prefects handle House matters.

218
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
The Gods deal with everything else.

219
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
And masters
should mind their own business.

220
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,600
Even the mighty Gods
can't expel people, Delahay.

221
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Who needs people expelled?

222
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,900
You wouldn't have let Martineau stay?
Of course.

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
But he wouldn't have sat down
for a week

224
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,100
after the Gods finished with him.

225
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
If we expel everyone who indulges...
There we are, aren't we?

226
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,900
The tone of this whole House
has gone to pieces

227
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
and you, Delahay,
are mainly responsible.

228
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,500
Fowler, please.
Yes. Shut up, Fowler.

229
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
But it's precisely attitudes like that...

230
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Will you shut up?!

231
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,900
Now, we're all, I know, very
distressed about what's happened.

232
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,100
Personally... well, I've always tried
to make everyone feel

233
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,400
he can come to me at any time,

234
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,000
whatever the problem.

235
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
But he must have been desperate.

236
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
It probably
wouldn't have made any difference.

237
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
But if he'd talked to me, to you...
Anyone!

238
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,800
However, we have to try
and overcome our personal feelings.

239
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
And remember
our responsibility to the House.

240
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,700
We don't want people rushing off
confessing things,

241
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,400
which, quite frankly, they'd
do better to keep to themselves.

242
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,200
If people have things to confess,
they should confess them.

243
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,700
A thorough clear-out
is what this House needs.

244
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I'd like there to BE a House
next term for me to be Head of.

245
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm sure it's not nearly on that scale.

246
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,900
Anyway, wouldn't you like
to start with a clean House?

247
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,500
Quite frankly, I doubt if such a thing
as a clean House exists,

248
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
in this school or any other.

249
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,700
What about a special session
of House prayers?

250
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,600
Almighty
and most merciful Father.

251
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,800
"Almighty
and most merciful Father,

252
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,800
"we have erred and strayed
from thy ways like lost sheep.

253
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
"We have followed too much

254
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,700
"the devices and desires
of our own hearts."

255
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,900
If you ask me, it all comes of having
masters who aren't old boys.

256
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
I see.

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Well, an old boy
would have more sense

258
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,900
than to go prowling around
gymnasium changing room.

259
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Everybody knows what goes on there.

260
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,500
Look, you'd better watch yourself,
Bennett.

261
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,300
Discretion is going to be the
better part of valour around here.

262
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,900
Wouldn't you say?

263
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,700
May I go and talk to Judd, please?

264
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,200
If you think you can get a word in.

265
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
"Thou shalt not lie with mankind
as with womankind.

266
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
"It is abomination.

267
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,100
"Neither shalt thy lie with any beast
to defile thyself therewith.

268
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,900
"Neither shall any woman stand before
a beast to lie down there too.

269
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,900
"It is confusion. Defile not ye
yourselves in any of these things."

270
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,300
Alone at last!
Get off.

271
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,400
I'll get you one day.
No, you won't.

272
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,700
Yes, I will. Everyone gives in
in the end. It's Bennett's Law.

273
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,900
I won't give in.
Then you're not normal.

274
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,100
My God, that was quick. Who did it?
Matron.

275
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
Poor Martineau.

276
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
The reason everyone gives in
in the end

277
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,000
is they get lonely
doing it on their own.

278
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,500
They long for company.
Well, I don't.

279
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Not your sort, anyway.

280
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,300
That's why my mother's marrying
this awful Colonel person.

281
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
Arthur.

282
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,400
It couldn't just possibly be
that she loves him?

283
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
Out of the question.

284
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,600
He's got one of those awful little
moustaches. He's ghastly.

285
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,800
Almost as much of a loather
as my father was.

286
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
You mean even you
would draw the line?

287
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't be revolting.

288
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,800
He's a grown-up.

289
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,200
Of course. And it's all
just a passing phase.

290
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Exactly.
Just like you being a communist.

291
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
Ha, ha.

292
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,300
Judd...
Hmm?

293
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,200
You and your usherette.
What about her?

294
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
Is is really so different?

295
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,700
From what?

296
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Boys.

297
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,600
How would I know?
I've only ever had a girl.

298
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,300
What is it, Wharton?

299
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,700
I don't know what to do
about Spungin's water.

300
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,700
Leave him to pass it on his own.
Pour it out.

301
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,200
He makes a terrible fuss
if his water's cold.

302
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,800
He said he'd report me to Barclay.

303
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,400
Go and fill up the jug
with new hot water, bring it back,

304
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,500
cover it with a flannel
and leave it by Spungin's bed.

305
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
Thanks, Judd.

306
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Hurry up, Wharton.
Yes, Delahay.

307
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,800
God, 'Das Kapital' looks difficult.

308
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,600
I haven't found anything
I couldn't understand eventually.

309
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,300
And if they taught us
any economics here

310
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,300
instead of Tudors
and bloody Stuarts...

311
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,100
Marx should be a set book
for the 6ths.

312
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,600
They shouldn't leave us to
fight our way through it on our own.

313
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,000
And under the blankets.

314
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Barclay confiscated
another torch last night.

315
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,800
How many's that?
12.

316
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,400
12 torches taken away

317
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,700
to stop me getting the education
I'm supposed to be here for.

318
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,400
God, if our parents only knew
what actually went on here.

319
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,300
They do know.

320
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,200
The fathers, anyway.

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,700
Bennett, what the hell
are you doing? Go to bed.

322
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,100
.. My kingdom says

323
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,400
.. I'm yours forever

324
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,900
.. Dear Lord, thy creatures all

325
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,200
.. I swear.....

326
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,100
What's this?

327
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm very sorry, Fowler,
I thought I...

328
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Juniors aren't required to think,
Wharton.

329
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,200
They're required to obey orders
and I told you to make this shine.

330
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
Yes, Fowler.

331
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,300
Well...

332
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,500
..not bad except for that smear.

333
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,100
Get it off.

334
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Yes, Fowler.

335
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
If you're going to be
in the south of France,

336
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,400
you might look around
for a little villa for August.

337
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,100
Might I?

338
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,300
Why not just extend the honeymoon?

339
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,200
I could pop down on the Blue Train
just as soon as school's over.

340
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,900
I see.

341
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,400
I only want to bring one friend.
It won't be at all expensive.

342
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
I don't think Arthur
would like Judd, darling.

343
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,400
I don't mean Judd, darling.

344
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,900
Anyway, Arthur thinks
everyone under the age of 18

345
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,900
is either a pinko or a pansy,

346
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,900
so it won't make much difference
who I bring, will it?

347
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,000
You know, I'm awfully worried.

348
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,500
You see, it is an established fact

349
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,100
that people who go around
suspecting vice in others

350
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,000
are highly suspect themselves.

351
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,400
But Arthur's the most normal man
I've ever known!

352
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,800
What better disguise?
Listen, there's still time to call it off.

353
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,500
Come on, let's stop the car.

354
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,100
You really shouldn't joke about it, Guy.

355
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
Not after that poor boy.

356
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I suppose
he was dreadfully unpopular.

357
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,000
Martineau? No.

358
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,900
I should've thought a boy like that...

359
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,800
Better off dead, no doubt about it.

360
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Well, I have known
one or two of, er... of those.

361
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,900
And they're never very happy,
you know.

362
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,500
Mummy!

363
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, they can be very amusing,
but, er... Oh, here we are!

364
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,000
If you ask me,
public schools go on too long.

365
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,800
Arthur means the fees.
It's not just the fees.

366
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,500
Look at Guy. He's not a boy anymore.
He's a young man.

367
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,200
Aren't you, old chap?
Rather.

368
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
You should leave at the end
of this term. Take a job for a bit.

369
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,500
Go round the world.
You must be mad.

370
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,500
School's just getting
to the good bit.

371
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,900
You need to find out a bit about life
before you go up to the varsity.

372
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,500
I second that.
Why not the army?

373
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,100
Why not, indeed? First class.

374
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,600
I mean, one learns so much about life
in the army.

375
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,900
Yes.
Killing people.

376
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,600
Excuse me.

377
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
Mummy!

378
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
How dare you talk like that?!

379
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,700
How dare you
plan to send me around the world

380
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,300
without even consulting me?

381
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,100
It's alright, Ivy.
Oh, excuse me.

382
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,100
It was only an idea, darling.
It's just that Arthur thought...

383
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Arthur!
We only want what's best for you.

384
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,000
If either of you seriously thinks
I would leave now,

385
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
after 10 years of hard labour

386
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,200
in the salt mines
of prep and public school...

387
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,800
You want to stay?
I'll be a God, Mummy.

388
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,400
What?

389
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,200
The school elite.
The creme de la creme.

390
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,900
Oh, yes. Of course.

391
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,800
It's the only thing that's made
the last 10 years endurable --

392
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
thnking one day I'd be top
of the whole stinking heap!

393
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
Well, if that's how you feel, darling.

394
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,600
I really must get back to my wedding.

395
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,900
Would you care for a drink, sir?

396
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,100
Ah, yes. A glass of sherry,
thank you.

397
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,700
Very good, sir.

398
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Gosh, you are brave.

399
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,500
Did you think I wouldn't come?

400
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,400
I, um, didn't know. I hoped you would.

401
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,000
Well...

402
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
..here I am.

403
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
I, um, hope you're hungry. I'm ravenous.

404
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,500
I've had nothing to eat but a bit
of caviar and toast all day long.

405
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Doesn't sound bad.

406
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,800
Oh! It's awful.

407
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,600
Listen, I, um...

408
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,400
..I can't call you Harcourt.

409
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,600
My name's Guy.
I know.

410
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,300
I found out.

411
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,200
Mine's James.
James.

412
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,200
That's a very nice name.

413
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,600
I nearly lost my nerve.

414
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,400
I passed a couple of masters
on the way here.

415
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Don't worry about them. They won't
come in here. They can't afford to.

416
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,100
Listen, then,
do you like smoked salmon?

417
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
I love it.

418
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,000
I-I love...

419
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,000
.. I-I love food and drink and...

420
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,600
Shall we get terribly, terribly drunk?

421
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,000
If you like!

422
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,100
The only thing is, though,
sometimes when I get drunk, I...

423
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,200
..I say things I shouldn't.

424
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,700
Still, we ought to have something
to celebrate with, oughtn't we?

425
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,700
Your sherry, sir.

426
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,900
Are you ready to order?

427
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,800
Ah, not yet.
Bring me the wine list, would you?

428
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
Here we are, sir.

429
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,400
We've a nice little hock,
if you care for hock, sir.

430
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,900
No, no, no -- champagne.

431
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,900
I've been drinking it all day
and it doesn't do to mix one's drinks.

432
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,600
What's the best champagne you've got?

433
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
The Moet, I suppose, sir.

434
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,000
It's been a most unfortunate affair,
of course,

435
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,000
but on the whole, the school
has not come out of it too badly.

436
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,100
For that, we must be extremely
grateful to Barclay and Henderson

437
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,100
for the admirable way they've
handled their respective Houses

438
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,700
through what could have been
a most serious crisis.

439
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Hear, hear.

440
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,900
We all know how quickly
scandal can spread.

441
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Actually, my father won't have
anyone in the firm from Harrow

442
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,500
because of what he's heard.

443
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Well, I can't imagine him wanting
anyone from Harrow, anyway.

444
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,500
But we do still
have to make it absolutely clear

445
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,600
to the outside world

446
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,100
this was
a completely isolated incident.

447
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
I cannot emphasise too strongly --

448
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,000
nothing even remotely like it
can ever be allowed to occur again.

449
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,300
Alright?

450
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,100
My real father died when I was 14.

451
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,100
How awful.

452
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
It was the Easter hols.

453
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
I was reading one night in my bed,

454
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
when I heard the most peculiar noise --

455
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,000
a sort of...
a sort of muffled squeaking.

456
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,100
Couldn't think what it was, at first.

457
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Sounded... trapped or something.

458
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,500
So I... I went down the passage

459
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,300
and it seemed to be coming
from my parents' room

460
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,000
and there was a light
under the door so...

461
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,400
.. I assumed...

462
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,400
None of my business.
Gosh.

463
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Then I... I distinctly heard
my mother say, "Help."

464
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,600
Help.

465
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,200
It was terribly eerie.

466
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,900
Complete silence
and there it was again. "Help."

467
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,100
I... I didn't know what to do.

468
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,900
No.

469
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,200
I went down the passage
and I knocked loudly on the door

470
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
and I said, "Are you alright?"

471
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
And she said, "Guy, quick, help."

472
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,700
She sounded
absolutely at her last gasp.

473
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,000
So I went in.

474
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,900
Listen, are you sure
you really want to hear this?

475
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,200
No. No,
not if you don't want to tell me.

476
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,600
No, I do.

477
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,600
My...

478
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,600
..my father had... had a heart attack.

479
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
Right in the middle of...
No!

480
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
Happens all the time, apparently.

481
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Well, what better way to go
for the man, but for my mother...

482
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,100
Well... she was trapped.

483
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,500
How absolutely incredible!

484
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,200
It was awful.

485
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,000
My mother kept her eyes closed
the whole time.

486
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,100
Only wish I could've done so.

487
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,500
It was so embarrassing.

488
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,300
It must have been.

489
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,700
She never really
looked me in the eye again.

490
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,600
See... I always hated him.

491
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,700
He was... he was vile.

492
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,200
My mother...

493
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,500
Always been very fond of my mother.

494
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,000
But, well...

495
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,300
..things haven't been quite the same
between us since...

496
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
..since then.

497
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,100
Perhaps that's why she married again.

498
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,300
Perhaps it is.

499
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Never thought about that.

500
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,100
You know what I'd like to do sometime?

501
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Ride around Europe on a bicycle.

502
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,300
With a tent.

503
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Sharing it
with someone you really like.

504
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,900
Mmm.

505
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,500
I've never spent the night with anyone.

506
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,900
Have you?
No.

507
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
Must be wonderful.

508
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
Have you ever been in love?

509
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,100
No. Have you?

510
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,100
No.

511
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,200
Must get in.

512
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,300
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

513
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,400
Fetch!

514
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,000
Come here. Come here!

515
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,800
Susie!

516
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,900
Come here!

517
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,500
Sit!

518
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Alright, Bennett, I've got you this time.

519
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Oh! God, I thought you were Fowler.

520
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,300
Ah! Oh! Ah!

521
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,900
Hmm!

522
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,800
That drainpipe's a bloody disgrace.

523
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,400
I must have a word
with the Housemaster.

524
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,900
Pshh!

525
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,100
Tommy...

526
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,500
May I call you Tommy, Tommy?

527
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,900
If you want.

528
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,600
Oh! I'm in love.

529
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,900
That's not exactly news.

530
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,300
Well, I... I don't mean in love.
I mean...

531
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,000
I mean in love.

532
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,700
You're drunk.

533
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,600
You know, till now,
it's just been a game but...

534
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,000
..now!

535
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,600
What are you doing here?

536
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,400
I thought you didn't have to
be back till tomorrow.

537
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,000
And why are you dressed like a God?
Um, practice for next term.

538
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,600
You'd better be careful not to get
any more food on that waistcoat.

539
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,400
It's grubby already.
Damn the waistcoat!

540
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,400
I've been waiting for this since my...

541
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,900
Nothing's ever going to be as good
again till I'm ambassador in Paris.

542
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,900
Don't be so pathetic.
Life is ladders, Tommy, that's all.

543
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,600
Prep school to here.

544
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
1st Form to 6th.

545
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,700
Second assistant junior undersecretary
to ambassador in Paris.

546
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,400
Sir Guy Bennett, KCVO, KCMG.

547
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,300
Comtemptible sycophant
in the service of the bourgeosie.

548
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,900
What?

549
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,200
It's what Lenin called
the renegade Karl Kautsky.

550
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,700
Did he indeed?

551
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,900
Because he substituted eclecticism
and sophistry for dialectics.

552
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,700
Oh, well, that is bad.

553
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,100
Grovelling about the kings and queens,
walking backwards!

554
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,900
Kissing hands.

555
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,500
You're utterly imbued
with the spirit of servility,

556
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,300
that's what he'd have said.

557
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,300
You mean he wouldn't have liked me?

558
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,800
No.

559
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,300
What about James?
Who's James?

560
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,000
Harcourt. His name's James.

561
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,800
Quite frankly, I don't think he'd
have cared much for the pair of you.

562
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,300
God! First, they take away my torches.

563
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,200
Then when I take my life --
or at least my bum -- in my hands

564
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,000
and creep here to do some work,
they send you.

565
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,900
This place is impossible.

566
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,300
'Night.
Goodnight.

567
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,100
.. Who stole my heart away.....

568
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,900
Huh!

569
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,100
.. Who makes me dream all day

570
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,700
.. Dreams I know will never come true

571
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:19,300
.. Seems as though
I'll ever be blue.....

572
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,700
All up!

573
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,200
Who's last?

574
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,100
Wharton.

575
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,000
Find Menzies and ask him to come
to me in the garden, right away.

576
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,700
Yes, Barclay.
Go on!

577
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Howzat!

578
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,800
Jim, good.
What is it?

579
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,500
I'm sorry, I've just discovered
something awful.

580
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,200
Mr Farquharson's thinking
of asking Fowler to stay on.

581
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,400
To be Head of House instead of you.
What?

582
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,800
You see, the House isn't going to have
enough prefects next term.

583
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,700
Why not? What do you mean?

584
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,300
It'll only be you and Bennett.
Two's not enough.

585
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
What about Devenish?
He's leaving.

586
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,600
His parents take a very dim view
of the Martineau business.

587
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,800
They want him to go to
agricultural college straightaway.

588
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,300
And as Fowler's a year senior to you
and as Judd refuses to be a prefect...

589
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,000
Judd!

590
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,100
Unless you can get him
to take a more responsible attitude,

591
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,700
you're a man short, Jim.

592
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,200
Fat chance!

593
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,800
I'm terribly sorry.

594
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,200
He's your only hope.

595
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,400
The answer is no.

596
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,300
I wish you'd reconsider.

597
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,000
I wish you'd let me work.

598
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,300
Look, I wouldn't ask you to do
anything you didn't want to do.

599
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,800
You just have to go through
the motions, that's all.

600
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,300
Prep duty, dorm, rollcall.
Nothing, really.

601
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Menzies, do you have the makings
of a politician?

602
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,800
I'm only speaking
as one friend to another.

603
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,400
You have! Well, well.

604
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,300
You don't want Fowler to be
Head of House any more than I do.

605
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,300
He'll make your life a complete misery.

606
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,900
Too bad.

607
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But I still refuse to collaborate
with a system of oppression.

608
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,600
Oh, for God's sake!

609
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,400
Oh, my God!

610
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,900
I can't look.

611
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,600
Are you alright, Bennett?

612
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,600
Shall I get Matron?

613
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,300
No. It was his smile.
It made me dizzy.

614
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,900
Everything beautiful is slightly lopsided.

615
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,400
There's a hollow
at the base of his throat

616
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,400
that makes me want to
pour honey over him and lick...

617
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,000
Bennett!
Hmm?

618
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Wharton, washing up was supposed
to be finished 10 minutes ago.

619
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,600
Bennett, come with me.

620
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,400
Have you completely lost your mind?!

621
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,900
Yes, actually.

622
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,500
After all that's happened,
you talk like that in front of a junior?!

623
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,500
He doesn't understand.
Of course he does!

624
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,700
You'd better take a pull on yourself, Guy.

625
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,600
I'd rather do it with you.

626
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,100
For God's sake, will you stop?!

627
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,000
You've got to start showing
a little responsibility.

628
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,900
What on earth are you talking about?!

629
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,800
You don't know what's going on.

630
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,700
Devenish may be leaving.
Well?

631
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,800
Fowler may be going to stay on
as Head of House.

632
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,500
It can't be true...

633
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,900
Unfortunately, it can.

634
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,500
I need your help, Guy.

635
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,400
It's all Judd's fault
for refusing to be a prefect.

636
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,500
I want you to talk to him.
You're much more his friend than I am.

637
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,300
Shouldn't think
there's a hope in hell.

638
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,900
Well, there must be.

639
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,200
Remember,
if Fowler becomes Head of House,

640
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,700
he certainly won't
put you up for the Gods.

641
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,400
I'm relying on you, Guy.

642
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,600
Prove your worth for once.

643
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,400
Alright, Devenish, let's have a look.

644
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,400
Not bad.

645
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,300
Not bad at all.

646
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,100
Bennett.
Where?

647
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,700
Don't be silly.
Let me see your uniform.

648
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,100
Well, it won't do.

649
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,000
It won't do at all.

650
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,600
What's wrong with it?

651
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,600
Do you call those creases?

652
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,400
Well, I'm not very handy
with the iron, actually.

653
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,500
Do them again. Do everything again.

654
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,900
I'm not having you
let down the whole House.

655
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,700
Won't be the WHOLE House, Fowler,
I mean...

656
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,500
..the juniors aren't in the corps.

657
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,100
Nor is Judd.

658
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,700
Don't mention Judd to me.

659
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,200
Judd?

660
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,300
Judd...

661
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,400
Judd, Judd, Judd, Judd, Judd...

662
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,100
The moon shines bright.

663
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,000
On such a night as this...

664
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,800
..when the sweet wind
did gently kiss the trees

665
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,200
and they did make no noise...

666
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,500
..on such a night, Bennett, methinks,
mounted the Gascoigne walls

667
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,000
and sighed his soul toward
the Longford tents...

668
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,700
..where Harcourt lay that night.

669
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,100
I can't do it.

670
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,900
I just cannot be a prefect.

671
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
Why not?

672
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I do have my reputation, you know.

673
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,700
Your what?!

674
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,300
I'm a school joke, I quite realise that.

675
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,900
But I am, don't you think,
a respected joke?

676
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,900
I do at least stick to my principles.
People appreciate that.

677
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,900
If I abandoned them now...

678
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,900
No. Sorry.

679
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But you don't care what people think.

680
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,000
About me personally, no.

681
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,500
But they'll say it was all a fake.

682
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,300
No.

683
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,200
Say, "That's what we said all along.
It's all a form of showing off."

684
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,400
On the contrary,
they'll see the means justifying the ends.

685
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,100
What could be more communist
than that?

686
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,200
They'll think it was all a fake.

687
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,700
They'll think all communists are fake.

688
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,600
That's what they say about Stalin.

689
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,900
What's Stalin got to do with it?

690
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,100
That man is sweating blood
night and day

691
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,300
to drag his country into the 20th century

692
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,600
and create a whole new concept
of society at the same time.

693
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,300
I can't stand it when people sneer at him.

694
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,300
Jokes about the Tzar...
Quick! Quick!

695
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,500
Thought I might find you here.

696
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,900
It's alright. I couldn't sleep either.

697
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,300
That bloody dog of Wharton's
gets on my nerves.

698
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,100
I should like to go walkies myself.
Want to come?

699
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm not exactly dressed for walking,
actually.

700
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,900
I was working.

701
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,700
Well... I won't disturb you.
Would you like my torch?

702
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
It IS yours.

703
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,300
Thanks.

704
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,900
This drainpipe's still alright, isn't it?

705
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,600
Afraid I can't tell you.

706
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,600
Barclay...
Yes?

707
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,500
Is the Housemaster really going to
ask Fowler to stay on?

708
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,400
Things do get about, don't they?

709
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,400
Is he?
I don't know.

710
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,400
To tell you the truth,
I don't actually care anymore.

711
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,500
I've had enough.

712
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,400
I haven't slept for nights and nights.

713
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,900
Really?

714
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,300
Frankly, I've got to the pitch
where I wonder why we bother.

715
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,900
Who?
Any of us.

716
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,900
Why we keep the whole thing going.

717
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,700
Sometimes I think none of us
really believes in it.

718
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,700
Of course you don't believe in it.

719
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,700
You're afraid to think of anything better.

720
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,100
Do you think so?

721
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
You know perfectly well
it's all nonsense.

722
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,800
You know it's positively wrong,
but you daren't act on your knowledge.

723
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,700
You daren't accept
the logical consequences.

724
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,300
Is that it?

725
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,200
You're afraid for your status,
your money, your class.

726
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,900
Everything that makes your life
safe and comfortable and privileged.

727
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,800
You're afraid to live
like an ordinary human being.

728
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,600
Perhaps I am.

729
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,500
Yes.

730
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,300
Leave the window open for me,
won't you?

731
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,100
My God...

732
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,700
..that man's really cracking up.

733
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,500
Liberals always do under pressure.

734
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,800
You know...
you're a really hard man, Tommy.

735
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,600
I've no time for him.

736
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,900
He just wants a nice easy life
with a nice easy conscience

737
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,000
and he's got no right to either.

738
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,600
I'm going to bed.

739
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,100
Are you going to join
the fight against Fowler?

740
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,500
I hate him so much,
it's difficult to be objective.

741
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,500
Well, the objective fact in this case

742
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,900
is that Fowler
is absolutely objectionable.

743
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,800
Please, Tommy.

744
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,100
If you appeal to me as your friend,
I'll never forgive you.

745
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,800
Menzies tried that.

746
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,500
I didn't mind it from him. He isn't a friend.

747
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,300
I'll think about it, but...

748
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,400
Oh, God, and I'll be in a rage
all day tomorrow.

749
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,400
Ah. Jacker Pot.

750
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,900
Militarism from 12:00 to 4:30.

751
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,300
Little boys all dressed up
and playing soldiers. God!

752
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,200
Tommy...

753
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,900
..if I lose his Jacker Pot...

754
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,100
..would you agree
to become a prefect then?

755
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,200
If you lose his Jacker Pot,

756
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,100
you probably won't be
a prefect yourself.

757
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,100
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

758
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,800
Guy?

759
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,800
Careful! Barclay's about.

760
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,500
I know. He nearly saw me.

761
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,000
Thought I'd have a heart attack.

762
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,400
Alright, thank you, Wharton.
Now my sash.

763
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,200
Good.

764
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,900
Good luck, Fowler.

765
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,400
Thank you, Wharton.

766
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,700
Fall in!

767
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,000
Battalion -- atten...tion!

768
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,300
Battalion ready for inspection, sir.

769
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,000
Thank you, Sergeant-Major.

770
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,600
How's your father?

771
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,500
Very well, thank you, sir.
Good. Good.

772
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,900
Why did you do it, Bennett?

773
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,900
Do what?
You lost us the Pot!

774
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,100
Surely not just me, all on my own?

775
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,500
You were far and away
the worst-dressed soldier on the parade.

776
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,500
I'm not a soldier,
I'm a schoolboy and so are you.

777
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,600
You're a disgrace to the House
and to the entire school.

778
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,300
I'm hopeless with Brasso.

779
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,900
I only get a good shine on my nails. Look!

780
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,500
Let me see your belt.

781
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,600
You want me to undress
in front of all these people?

782
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,100
Give it to me!

783
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,000
I reckon that's worth a full six strokes.

784
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,300
Alright, Fowler. You can go ahead.

785
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,900
Thank you.

786
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,800
Come on, Bennett.
I appeal to Barclay and Delahay.

787
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,300
Of course.

788
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,300
It's my right. They're our House Gods.

789
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,100
It won't do you any good.

790
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,700
It's still my right.

791
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,300
Alright. If you insist.

792
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,700
If you let him off...
We won't.

793
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Bennett's appealed to House Gods.

794
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,100
Gosh.

795
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,300
I wonder what they'll do to him.

796
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,800
Give him a jolly good beating,
I should think.

797
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,800
Well, um...

798
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,500
..I just thought you ought to know...

799
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,900
..that if one stroke of Fowler's cane
lands on my arse,

800
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:54,200
I shall go straight
to Mr Farquharson, and, ah...

801
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,900
..give him the names
of all the people I've...

802
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,700
..done it with
over the past three years, that's all.

803
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,900
Bennett, you can't do this.

804
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,400
Oh, I shall begin at the top.

805
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,600
Well... can I, um... go now?

806
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,300
Bloody little tart!

807
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,500
You never thought it
particularly bloody at the time.

808
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,200
My God, I'll thrash you myself!

809
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,500
It's only a game, Delahay.
There's no need to get so excited.

810
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,900
I thought sportsmen
were supposed to be good losers.

811
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,600
I'd never have dared do that.

812
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,700
It's only cheating.

813
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,800
Everyone cheats here the whole time.

814
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,400
I don't.

815
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,700
I bet you do.

816
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,400
When you've got the chance.

817
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,400
I don't even crib!

818
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,700
I don't mean work, I mean games.

819
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,500
Sportsmanship.

820
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,900
It's all hypocrisy.

821
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,700
Well... we all know what goes on
in the scrum when the ref's not looking.

822
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,500
Oh, well...

823
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,600
..if THAT'S what you mean.

824
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,400
Mmm.

825
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,300
Yes, of course.

826
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,000
It'll be getting light soon.

827
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,900
Mmm.

828
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,300
I must be going.

829
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,300
Come on.

830
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,700
You know...

831
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,700
..what I really hate about cricket...

832
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,700
..is it's such a damn good game.

833
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,600
Ah, Judd's Paradox.

834
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,400
Of course...

835
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,800
..cricket is a fundamental part
of the capitalist conspiracy, hmm?

836
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,400
Of course.

837
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,000
One only has to observe the team.

838
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,000
There's the proletariat
forced to labour in the field

839
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,000
while the bourgeoisie indulges in
the pleasures of batting and bowling.

840
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,600
Quite.

841
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,000
I mean, there's every reason
to suppose...

842
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,200
..that the game ultimately derives

843
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,300
from the wholly unjustified right
of the medieval lord

844
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,800
to the unpaid labour of villeins and serfs
at haymaking and harvest.

845
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,900
You're really beginning to get the idea.

846
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,300
Thanks.

847
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,000
Ah, there he is at the school shop.

848
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,300
Isn't he awesome, Tommy?

849
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,500
Drawing attention to yourself again?

850
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,300
He's not even waving back.

851
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,000
Course he's not.

852
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,600
You should learn from his discretion.

853
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,900
Oh, if only I could.

854
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,100
I can't get you to change your mind?
It's my father.

855
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,800
When he asked what I'd be staying for,
it was hard to say.

856
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,300
The First XI next term?

857
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,100
It's a long time to wait
on the off-chance.

858
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,500
If I was going to be a God,
but... as it is,

859
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,500
just being an ordinary prefect
doesn't really make it worthwhile.

860
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,100
Sorry.

861
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,900
By the way...

862
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,700
.. I've decided that greatest happiness
of the greatest number

863
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,000
will best be achieved
if I do agree to be a prefect.

864
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,100
Tommy!

865
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,800
Stop it.

866
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,300
I'll insist on the terms
set forth by Menzies

867
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,100
with one extra condition --
I refuse to take House prayers.

868
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,100
Oh, he won't care about that.
Oh, Tommy, my cup runneth over.

869
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,400
You really are a hero of the people.

870
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,200
I'm going to award you the Order
of Lenin, first class with oak leaves.

871
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,000
If I wasn't in love with James,
I'd be in love with you.

872
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,500
Don't be so emotional.
It's a purely rational decision.

873
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,200
Go on. Go tell Menzies
before you change your mind.

874
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,300
Alright, alright.
He's in the music school.

875
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,000
Go on. Hurry!
Going, going.

876
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,300
Wharton!
Yes, Bennett?

877
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,500
Want to earn yourself another ice-cream?

878
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,900
I wouldn't mind.

879
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,700
If you go to school shop, you'll
find a man from Longford -- Harcourt.

880
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,000
Do you know him?
By sight.

881
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,600
Good. Give him this.

882
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,200
Here's sixpence.

883
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,200
Why are you so keen on Harcourt?

884
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,300
If you don't know,
I'm certainly not going to tell you.

885
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,800
Now get along.

886
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,600
Oh!

887
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,800
I'll have that, if you don't mind, Wharton.

888
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,700
Now, come on! Give it to me!

889
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
Alright, Wharton. Thank you.

890
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,400
Thank you very much.

891
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,400
Menzies, can I have a word?

892
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,100
Yes, of course. What is it?

893
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,600
I am willing to become a prefect...
Menzies!

894
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,800
..but there are some conditions...
Menzies!

895
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,300
Look at this.

896
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,400
What is it?

897
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,500
I've got him this time.

898
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,300
He can't get away now.

899
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,700
I'm taking this straight to Barclay.

900
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,800
What on earth's that all about?

901
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,900
Just one moment, Judd.

902
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,400
We can discuss this later.

903
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,100
Devenish, do you think it would
make any difference to your attitude,

904
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,300
or your father's attitude,

905
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,700
if you told him you would be in the Gods
next term, instead of Bennett?

906
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,300
I'm sure it would.

907
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,800
Perhaps you should
go and telephone him.

908
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,500
You mean there's a real chance?

909
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Wharton!

910
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,600
Tell Bennett to come to Hall Table.

911
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,400
I can't do it.

912
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,400
What's the matter? Lost your nerve?

913
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,500
Alright, I'll do it. Come on.

914
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,300
Alright, Bennett. Bend over.

915
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,600
I don't understand.

916
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,400
Why didn't you
just use the blackmail again?

917
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,400
Because.

918
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,900
Because what?

919
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,100
Because if I'd gone to Housemaster...

920
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,400
..it'd all come out about James.

921
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,000
So what?

922
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,700
We'd have both been expelled.

923
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,900
Lucky you.

924
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,400
I couldn't do that.

925
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,500
I love him.
Oh, come on, Guy.

926
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,700
Look, I'm not going to pretend anymore.

927
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,300
I'm sick of pretending!

928
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,500
You think it's a joke. Well, it's not.

929
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
I am never going to love women!

930
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,100
Don't be ridiculous!

931
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Martineau knew that about himself
when he was 10. He told me.

932
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,900
You can't possibly know that
at 10 or now.

933
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,300
Yes, you can.

934
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,200
Look, it doesn't...
come as any great revelation.

935
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,000
It's... more like admitting to yourself
something you've always known.

936
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,600
Owning up to yourself. It's...

937
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,900
It's a great relief... in some ways.

938
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,700
You can't trust intuitions like that.

939
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,300
Well, what else is there?

940
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,100
Are you a communist
because you read Karl Marx? No.

941
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,300
You read Karl Marx
because you are a communist.

942
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,800
I'm very sorry for you.

943
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,500
Thanks! If that's how friends react...

944
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,100
I'm sorry.

945
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,400
You're quite right.
That was patronising and unforgivable.

946
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,900
But you couldn't help it, could you?

947
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,700
Because in your heart of hearts,

948
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,700
like Barclay and Delahay
and Fowler and Menzies,

949
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,300
you still believe...

950
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,800
..in spite of your talk
of equality and fraternity,

951
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,900
you still believe...

952
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,500
..some people are better than others
because of the way they make love.

953
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,900
Well... 

954
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,500
..think of that for a lifetime.

955
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,700
Think of the names.

956
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,100
Pansy. Nancy. Fairy. Fruit.
Brown-nose.

957
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,500
Look...

958
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,700
This hurts like hell. I'm...

959
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,200
I'm... I'm gonna walk it off.

960
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,500
Coming?

961
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,600
Good, that's settled then, Donald.
Thanks.

962
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,200
I mean, well, thanks.

963
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:45,200
Bennett can't complain.
I've warned him time and again.

964
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,100
Oh, good. Here they are.
Wonderful news.

965
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,400
Devenish is staying on after all.

966
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,800
It's most generous of you to offer, Judd,

967
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,600
but you can keep your principles
untarnished now.

968
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,900
But I've a disappointment
for you, Bennett,

969
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,400
though it can hardly
come as a surprise after recent events.

970
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,000
I shall be nominating Devenish
for the Gods next term instead of you.

971
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,000
You bastard.

972
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,900
You really gave me no choice, Guy.

973
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,700
Don't you ever
call me by my Christian name again.

974
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,900
Ever.

975
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,600
You were easily bought.

976
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,600
My father was a God himself
and when I told him...

977
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:37,000
Yes, your son will be a God, and
your son's son, unto the end of school.

978
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,100
Look, we saved the House
from Fowler.

979
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,600
We saved your conscience.

980
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:44,100
Oh, yes. All problems solved
for life. No commies and no queers.

981
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,900
Don't let's quarrel.

982
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,100
We've all got to live together
next term.

983
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,100
Let's try and do it
as amicably as possible, shall we?

984
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,000
It isn't the end of the world.

985
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,300
Isn't it?

986
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,200
When people like Menzies
rule the world...

987
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,700
..and you want to be ambassador
in Paris... 

988
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,300
"Ah, Bennett, yes.

989
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,900
"Nice enough chap.

990
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,000
"Quite amusing, actually.

991
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,100
"We had high hopes of him once
but... oh, yes, you heard.

992
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,200
"Not... not quite one of us.

993
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,300
"Bogota, do you think? No.
Haiti -- isn't that coming up?

994
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,500
"That's much more his line.
You see, he was never a God.

995
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,900
"Only ever an ordinary prefect."

996
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,400
No need to be even that.

997
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,800
Oh, yes, there is.

998
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,300
If I'm spending the rest of my life...

999
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,000
..hiding my true nature...

1000
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,600
..I'm taking every comfort that's going
when it IS going.

1001
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,100
Oh, well, if that's your attitude.

1002
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,000
And, besides, being absolutely...

1003
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,200
..objective...

1004
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,400
..it would dish me once and for all.

1005
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,300
You can't have things both ways.

1006
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,900
Why not?

1007
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,300
OW!

1008
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,800
Why not?

1009
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,600
Pretend to do one thing,
only really do the other.

1010
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,400
Fool the swine. Play along with them.
Let them think what they like.

1011
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,400
Let them despise you, but all along...

1012
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,900
Oh, don't talk dribble.

1013
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,700
..and have the last laugh
and be revenged.

1014
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,300
That's just sentimental twaddle.

1015
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,700
You wouldn't be in this mess
if you had any discretion at all.

1016
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,800
What better cover
for someone like me than...

1017
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,700
..total indiscretion?

1018
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,200
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if communism were really true?

1019
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,800
It is true.

1020
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,700
What? Heaven on earth?

1021
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,100
Earth on earth.

1022
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,800
The JUST earth.

1023
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,700
Of course, Tommy was killed
in the Spanish Civil War.

1024
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,500
Tough as old boots, Tommy was.

1025
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
Till the bloody fascists got him.

1026
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,200
Have you ever wanted to go back?

1027
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,800
No.

1028
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,000
Is there nobody
that you'd want to see?

1029
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,600
No.

1030
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,800
Isn't there anything you miss at all?

1031
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,900
I...

1032
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,300
.. I miss the cricket.

1033
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:52,700
.. Most dear
to them that love her

1034
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:58,600
.. Most great to them that know

1035
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:04,500
.. We may not count her armies

1036
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:10,300
.. We may not see her king

1037
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:16,100
.. Her fortress is a faithful heart

1038
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:22,100
.. Her pride is suffering

1039
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:28,100
.. And soul by soul and silently

1040
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:34,200
.. Her shining bounds increase

1041
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:40,400
.. And her ways
are ways of gentleness

1042
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:46,300
.. And all her paths are peace...
