00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,237
Hi, Maxine. Hello, Slam Dunk.

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,607
Made your quota today? I
had it covered by lunch.

3
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:53,312
How about yourself?
Still working on it, baby.

4
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,247
Still working on it.

5
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:09,394
Gentlemen are so rare these days.
How can I ever repay you?

6
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,643
Why, thank you.

7
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,880
Gentlemen are so rare
these days. How can I...

8
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,951
<i>I' La migra! I' La migra!</i>

9
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:14,927
Immigration. Let's see some I.D.,

10
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,563
I'm wearing it.

11
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,400
Good afternoon, madam,
I'm Sharon from Total Woman.

12
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,307
Good afternoon, madam. I'm Sharon
from Total Woman Cosmetics,

13
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:32,511
a new and exciting line of home beauty
aids for a new and exciting home beauty.

14
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,746
<i>Yo no hablo ingles.</i>

15
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,983
Her jojoba body lotion is just fabulous.

16
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,525
<i>It's my move! You moved! It's my move!</i>

17
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,663
All right, this is a bust!

18
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,766
Hello?

19
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,302
Hi, Maxie. Hi, Maxie.

20
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,909
Careful, fellas, you might spoil
me with too much attention.

21
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,946
How are you doing, Turtle?

22
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,981
I don't know.

23
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:47,352
Well, you think about it.

24
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,056
Wait! Ho! Hey, girl, wait a minute here!

25
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,393
Say, you a lot of trouble for me!
You never pay anyway.

26
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,462
It's the principle! You're just lucky
it's on blocks and hard to tow,

27
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,531
or it would have been gone by now.

28
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,933
You're finished! Do you mind?

29
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,310
- Mind?
- No, I don't mind.

30
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,979
I can win now, I can win later.
I don't mind.

31
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,916
Say, Mr. Fix-It, can't you
keep that bitch in line?

32
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,519
I told ya, don't call her a bitch.

33
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:24,022
Lighten up, Fix-It.
Now bitch don't mean nothing.

34
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,325
I call my old lady that.

35
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,861
Call 'em all that. Say, bitch!

36
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,432
See? Boardwalk, are you here on business?

37
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,567
Yeah.

38
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,670
What, a baby carriage?

39
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,374
You want to sell a baby carriage?
Baby carriage?

40
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:46,845
Compare this to a baby carriage,
you talking Toyota to Cadillac.

41
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,881
I mean, you either got a
car, or you got a ride.

42
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:54,686
<i>We're talking chrome wire
wheels, front disc brakes.</i>

43
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,356
Sure. Ten dollars.

44
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:01,793
Man, this book from 1935. The
carriage is from 1932. Here.

45
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:05,497
Garvey, you don't understand,
This old shit's comin' back.

46
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:09,067
Look here, they got a
blanket, a little pillow.

47
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,870
Look at the tires, they're radials.
Never wear out.

48
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,139
Ten. Ten?

49
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,410
Ten.

50
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,879
Did you move? Answer the phone.

51
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:28,653
<i>Hello. Mama, how you doing?</i>

52
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,456
Mama, I'll be there.

53
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,892
It's your 90th birthday.

54
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,763
Sure, Mama.

55
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,665
No, Jerry won't be there.

56
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:45,437
Because he's dead, Mama.
He's been dead for ten years.

57
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,141
That's right. That's why
he wasn't there last year.

58
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,644
Anything I can bring you?

59
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,649
Yeah.

60
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,455
No, Mama, I can't bring that.

61
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,659
Why? Because the doctor has to prescribe it.
You know that.

62
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,196
<i>Look, I got to go now, Mama.</i>

63
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,466
Yeah. Yes, I'll be there.

64
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,770
I promise. All right? All right, Mama.

65
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:26,144
So what are you looking at? You never
saw a son talk to his mother before?

66
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,147
Yeah. Here.

67
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,691
Damn!

68
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,127
Tyrone.

69
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:50,569
I wouldn't forget you. You know that. Here.

70
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm just taking care of him for this
afternoon, 'til Slam Dunk's done.

71
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,843
Turtle!

72
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,079
You don't be robbin' no baby, man.

73
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,584
Jesus Christ!

74
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,521
My God, Turtle. What... Move the carriage,

75
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,025
How's your mother?

76
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:18,530
Ninety. Come on, it's your move.

77
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,936
It's gonna cost you more this time. What?

78
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:29,140
Me. Guarding the store
when you go see your mother.

79
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,243
We're gonna have to make it
25 bucks for the day.

80
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:36,615
Twen... What is this, a welfare office?
What do you mean "welfare"?

81
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:40,752
You know how much a real
security guard would cost ya?

82
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,222
Move. I'm not on welfare. I
don't believe in welfare.

83
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,925
You believe in eating?
It's a temporary layoff.

84
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,161
Temporary. Six months? I
talked to Kurnitz yesterday.

85
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,598
He said things were picking up. He
said he'd have me back on the job.

86
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,235
<i>Takes time.</i> Hey, Garvino.

87
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,005
How's it going? Listen, McGarvey.

88
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,842
Hey, baby. You miss daddy?

89
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,611
<i>Any dumb punkers been picking on ya?</i>

90
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,715
Don't worry about it, baby,
'cause we are reunited.

91
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,694
How much?

92
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,263
Twenty bucks.

93
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,799
Twenty bucks?

94
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,835
That's a brand new BMW radio, man.

95
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:35,574
You know what those things go for?
Yeah. 326 bucks.

96
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,713
Well, a piece as hot as this, they
could raise my fire insurance.

97
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,817
No, Garvey. My brother-in-law give it to me.

98
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,186
Your brother-in-law drives a BMW?

99
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,923
Twenty bucks.

100
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,630
All right, all right.

101
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,334
That's enough with that noise, Come on.

102
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,670
Hey, Garvey,

103
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,607
she's mine.

104
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,742
Have you read a newspaper lately?

105
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:14,279
Today's the 16th. She's
been mine for a week now.

106
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,984
I got the money. Clean green, pal.

107
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:23,254
Twenty-five dollars. It ain't 25.

108
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,256
It is. That's what you gave me for her.

109
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,326
That's what I gave you.
That's not what you give me.

110
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,129
I'm in business. I have to make a profit.

111
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,398
<i>Capisce?</i>

112
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,168
How much profit? Well, read the tag.

113
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,408
A hundred and fifty dollars!
Now, look, I know it ain't much,

114
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,112
but they don't want that kind anymore.
You scumbag!

115
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:53,051
You thievin', low-life, son of
a puke brain, bastard bitch!

116
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,220
She's mine! Wait a minute.

117
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:58,957
You want a guitar, I want a burglar alarm.

118
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,060
You put one in that works,
we'll figure something out.

119
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,964
You kidding me? You sleazy,
bloodsucking ditz!

120
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,066
I don't make deals with leeches!

121
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,439
Tomorrow for the morning, he does it.

122
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,875
The hell I will!

123
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,944
I ought to tear your head off
and shit down your neck!

124
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,317
Such a sweet kid.

125
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,320
All he needs is a chance.

126
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,057
Is that the way you're gonna go? Of course.

127
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,359
Dillard, you listen to me, okay?
I ain't helping that bastard!

128
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,762
I know. But you said I would.

129
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:43,068
No, I said you can fix the alarm. Well?

130
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,237
I bet you can fix it good. <i>Â¿Que no?</i>

131
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,040
You mean, fix it so's we can get in?

132
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,483
You hear anything?

133
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,386
You talking to me? Yeah.

134
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:05,323
I didn't hear nothing. Baby's crying.

135
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,927
Besides, I don't talk Mexican.

136
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,466
<i>I don't think it's a good
idea. I don't know.</i>

137
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:18,103
Dillard, you not to worry, okay?

138
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,012
He don't want to mess with your old man.

139
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,148
Good afternoon.

140
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,320
Good afternoon.

141
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,256
How are you today?
I saw your sign out front.

142
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,026
I thought this might be a good
place to... Hock an adding machine?

143
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,997
Nah, I got three of them in last week.
Top of the line.

144
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,900
Kurnitz? Kurnitz!

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,140
Boy, am I glad to see you.

146
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,143
Lou Garvey, Jack Kurnitz. My boss.

147
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,145
I told ya he was coming to see me.

148
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,548
Well, when do I start? What do I do?

149
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,950
What are you doing with the adding machine?

150
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,056
You said things were gettin' better.

151
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:15,393
Yeah, well, they got worse. Worse?

152
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,463
- What do you mean, worse?
<i>- Worse!</i>

153
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,200
You know, worse?

154
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:26,037
<i>Come on, Turtle. I need a
little bit of fresh air.</i>

155
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,173
See you tomorrow.

156
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:38,216
Shit. I got to figure out something to do.
I have an idea.

157
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,820
What? Why don't we go get something to eat?

158
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:46,558
Jesus Christ, Turtle!

159
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,231
You're just like my mother!

160
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,500
It's Thursday? Yeah.

161
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,070
What do we always do? Guacamole?

162
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:14,219
Well, baby, maybe Mr. Fix-It and
I talk a little business. Maybe?

163
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,225
Hey, Slam Dunk, baby. Don't
baby me, you lazy fool.

164
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,428
What the hell am I paying you for?
You are worthless.

165
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,065
Pimps givin' you trouble? Nothing
I can't handle, no thanks to you!

166
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,168
You supposed to be walking
around. Look tough!

167
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,504
How the hell am I supposed to look
tough carrying Tyrone around?

168
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,506
Damn right!

169
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,942
What you do that for? For doing nothing!

170
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,912
Gophers gonna be delivering
your mail, you keep that up!

171
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,515
You got that wrong, Slam Dunk! You my woman!

172
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:49,287
As usual, you got it wrong. You my pimp!
At least you was.

173
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,389
What's this "was" shit?

174
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,359
"Was" like in ain't no more!

175
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,527
There's your stuff.

176
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,666
Say, wait a minute here. Wait! Ain't you
forgetting a little something? Tyrone!

177
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:09,374
Yeah. I still can't figure
out how you managed that.

178
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:20,151
Yeah, I know exactly what
you mean, Tyrone. Exactly.

179
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,233
Hey, you...

180
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,435
You bet.

181
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,238
Look, I got... Shit.

182
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,652
You got work for me?

183
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,322
<i>Â¿Que pasa, man?</i>

184
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,325
Let's see some I.D.,

185
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:08,666
What's the problema, Ramon? Immigration.
They took my mother last week.

186
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,709
Hi, David. Hi, Maria.

187
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,548
<i>Maria, what you doing here?</i>

188
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,618
I'm going to the market. Don't you
know La Migra's around? Let's go.

189
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,554
I can't stay home all the time!

190
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,256
<i>Mientras yo mande, usted hace lo que diga.</i>

191
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,192
But this is silly! Mama didn't say...

192
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,661
<i>I' Maria! A mama se la llevo La Migra.</i>

193
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,263
<i>Yo soy responsable hasta que yo regrese.</i>

194
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:43,134
<i>Y mientras yo siga responsable,
usted no sale sola, punto.</i>

195
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,538
<i>I' Claro que no!</i>
But you're gonna act like one.

196
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,208
Hey, what's going on? Who's this?

197
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,445
Dillard, you no butt in, okay?
Maria. His sister.

198
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,082
Nice to meet you. I didn't
know Ramon had a sister.

199
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,184
He didn't know he had a sister
'til last week.

200
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,587
Suddenly he's big brother.

201
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,258
Yeah, and if I catch anybody messing
with her, I cut his <i>pescuezo.</i>

202
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,295
<i>Y usted, vamonos.</i> Come on, Ramon.
You're a real pain.

203
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,333
<i>I didn't do anything!</i>

204
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,631
You know, this is really for people over 21?

205
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,535
He is. He just forgot his I.D.

206
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,606
Well, it's the foreman, my main man.

207
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:33,111
Hey, don't worry, Turtle. I
come to deal, not to steal.

208
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,846
You mind if I sit down?

209
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,190
I, got some information for Garvey.

210
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,527
Say somebody installs an alarm,

211
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:54,565
only he was gonna rig it so him and
his buddy could get around it.

212
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:59,470
- Dillard and Ramon.
<i>- Right.</i>

213
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,405
<i>What do ya think?</i>

214
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:05,376
I think it's great. Serves Garvey right.

215
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,546
I'm serious! What do ya say?

216
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:17,722
It won't work. Gettin' inside is easy.

217
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,725
No way they're gonna crack that safe.
It's a Hauser.

218
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:24,395
The safe? Goddamn!

219
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:28,266
I thought they was breaking in
for some little shit.

220
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,836
That's good. That's good!
He's got to give us a reward!

221
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,872
Garvey?

222
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,841
<i>Hi, Fernando.</i>

223
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,613
<i>Â¿Como esta, Maxine? Mucho caliente.</i>

224
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:49,587
I know you two are friends, Weslake,
but I swear I don't understand it.

225
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,457
Maybe you'll get lucky. It
ain't happened so far today.

226
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,861
Well, there's always tomorrow, Papa.

227
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,198
<i>I'll check you later, Mama.</i>

228
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Papa, Mama. I don't believe it.

229
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,835
Hey, relax, my dance card's already full.

230
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,971
I got to get back into the mainstream.

231
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,741
You already are. You're unemployed.

232
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,677
Big joke.

233
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,879
Hey, come on, let's have a drink. Fernando.

234
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,615
Your place. I keep forgetting it's Thursday.

235
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,985
You're gonna pay for that, Weslake.

236
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,328
Monday. Senor Weslake, it's been a month.

237
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,298
Catch you Friday, Ferdie. Bye, Turtle.

238
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,414
You pervert!

239
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,755
<i>Hey, Weslake, guess what?</i>

240
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:10,094
<i>I'm free Saturday night. Garvey's
standing me up this week.</i>

241
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,763
It's his mother's birthday. I know.

242
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:18,002
So I thought I might like to play in
the pawn shop with the security guard.

243
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,073
Remember last year,

244
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:25,710
Does he still have that thing with
the pulleys? Block and tackle? Yeah.

245
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,413
I'm not guarding the place this year.
You're not?

246
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:33,384
No, it's the age of electronics. What?

247
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,653
He's putting in a burglar alarm system.

248
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,127
Enough Ping-Pong.

249
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,633
They have the replay of the
Cleveland game on afterwards.

250
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,069
Really?

251
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,708
"Dear <i>Penthouse:</i>"

252
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,680
"Being a librarian from Laramie,
Wyoming, may not sound very exciting,"

253
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:07,084
"but last night something happened that
I just thought I would share with you."

254
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,987
Midnight cowgirl?

255
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,491
"Just before closing there
was a knock at the back door.

256
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:18,462
It was Jim, a local cowboy and a real hunk."

257
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,998
We can't do that one.
We don't have a saddle.

258
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,002
Look in the closet.

259
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,078
You're outrageous.

260
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,815
Well, if you don't want to, I
could always try it with Garvey.

261
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,952
You got to be kidding. You'd
need paramedics standing by.

262
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,556
Yeah? You'd be surprised.

263
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,927
He may be a little short of breath, but
at least he doesn't watch Ping-Pong.

264
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,999
Go on. "Jim, a local
cowboy and a real hunk."

265
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:02,706
"I should have said no to him. I was
breaking all the library rules.

266
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,476
"But he just laughed, locked the door...

267
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,212
and pushed me into the Rare Book Room."

268
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,327
Ever been in a sensory
deprivation tank, Weslake? What?

269
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:40,297
It's a great change of pace.

270
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:44,868
I have a friend, he has one of those clubs.

271
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,205
I got to go, hot stuff.

272
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:52,209
- That must be Turtle.
- Turtle can wait, cowgirl.

273
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,112
I got some range to ride,
front pasture to plow.

274
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,782
Weslake, I am late for work.

275
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:03,387
I'll see you Saturday. We could
try that skydiving next time.

276
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:07,057
We could hang that parachute
harness up in here.

277
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,393
<i>I'll be the Red Baron!</i>

278
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,862
Mr. Weslake?

279
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:20,004
I can just see your bare ass
swingin' in that harness.

280
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,741
Mr. Weslake? Yes?

281
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,910
Sorry to bother you, but, I have
to get your block converter.

282
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,747
My what? The little box on your TV.

283
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,949
My cable? Why? It works terrific.

284
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,352
You're a little behind on your
subscription payments. Me?

285
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:39,089
Six months. No, no, no. That's gotta be
some kind of computer foul-up at the bank.

286
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,258
It's okay. I'll make it all right.

287
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,763
Look, you can't take it. I've been waiting
for ages for that Nakajima-Cuellas fight.

288
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:50,401
You can't take it now. Sorry, Mr.
Weslake, but don't worry about the fight.

289
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,137
Nakajima, he's gonna tear him apart.

290
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,379
Won't be much to see.

291
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,092
That's awful. What?

292
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,395
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

293
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:22,232
Tack it in the joint there. Keeps it
out of sight, doesn't look so messy.

294
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,171
Come here.

295
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:30,741
What? Take a look.

296
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,877
You wanna sell your father's watch?

297
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,247
No. Are you telling me what time it is?

298
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,084
No, I was just wondering what
something like that might be worth.

299
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,720
To me?

300
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,095
It's real gold. Plate.

301
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,964
Gold! Solid gold.

302
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,967
It runs great.

303
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,269
It's running a little slow.

304
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,373
Six bucks.

305
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,877
Six bucks! It's an antique!

306
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:12,516
We're talkin' about a time when men
made things by hand. That was then.

307
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:16,253
These days, you buy a watch,
you wanna see what time it is.

308
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,890
Look, Weslake, you don't wanna hock this.

309
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,359
Here, here. Come on.

310
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,232
You know, it's a good thing
I don't need the money,

311
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:32,236
because if I was serious about pawning
that watch, you would have made me angry.

312
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:37,174
Very angry! Listen, business is business.

313
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:41,078
Yeah. Yeah, business is business.

314
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,815
Well, here's a nickel.
I'm gonna use the john.

315
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:48,418
The best things in life are free.

316
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:32,563
Turtle! I'll meet you
in Garvey's in ten minutes.

317
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,933
Good morning, Mrs. O'Malley.
Aye. Good morning.

318
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,237
Jasmine, we're going now. Hi.

319
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:22,412
And don't be creative. Just move the
furniture exactly the way we told you.

320
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,918
And Jasmine?

321
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,522
Don't use my cast iron pan.
It's only for omelettes.

322
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:36,260
Worry me about a pot and a pan!

323
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,600
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...

324
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,007
Weren't you just doin' that?

325
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:53,277
He don't want me to forget,
so he keeps me practicin'.

326
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,680
Remember what you were talkin'
about yesterday? Yeah.

327
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,983
I think we may be able
to work somethin' out.

328
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,619
There's a girl cleaning the apartment
on the second floor right behind us.

329
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,255
Entrance is on 23rd Street.

330
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,258
Go in there and find out who lives
there, what their hours are;

331
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,428
Make a little drawing of the
apartment, where everything is. Okay?

332
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,231
What's that got to do with
Dillard, Ramon and Garvey?

333
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,268
If you and me are going to be
working together, I'm in charge.

334
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,239
Got it? Meet me at my
place, up there, at 3:00.

335
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:25,275
3119. Just up the street.

336
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,611
Okay? Wait, wait.

337
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,581
What do I get? Rich... maybe.

338
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,117
Depends on what she says.

339
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,955
And, Boardwalk... keep your mouth shut.

340
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:42,092
You're talkin' to the right man.

341
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,096
Come on, Tyrone.

342
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,600
Give me the key.

343
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:53,470
What for? You gotta trust him, Garvey.

344
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,572
He's installing it.

345
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:08,218
<i>All right. Now let's see if it works.</i>

346
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,555
Let's see.

347
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:15,559
Nobody broke in yet. We have to wait?

348
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,729
Jesus. I'm gonna lock the
door from the outside,

349
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:21,331
and you open the door without the key.

350
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,467
That's somebody breakin' in.
It's all wired to the key.

351
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:27,270
All right. All wired to the key.

352
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,378
Yippee! Let her blow!

353
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,281
<i>Shut it off already! No, here, I'll do it!</i>

354
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,583
Disturb the whole neighborhood.

355
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,586
Shut it off!

356
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:20,791
Shut it off,

357
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,166
<i>It doesn't work!
The stupid switch doesn't work!</i>

358
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,737
Dillard, come on, do something!

359
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,147
Power main.

360
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,417
<i>Okay, hold it! Right there!</i>

361
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,121
Nobody moves! Put your gun away, Ronnie.

362
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,657
Garvey's just testing his new burglar alarm.

363
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,761
Weslake, what's going on?

364
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:01,765
You're telling me Garvey paid for an alarm?

365
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,235
That's right, wise guy.

366
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:09,239
You hear it this Saturday, you come
in blasting. You got my permission.

367
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,741
Good morning, madam.
I'm with the gas company.

368
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,312
Say, babe, I'm your gas man.

369
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:23,887
Tyrone! No, no! Not now!

370
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,390
Look, I know it's the only
thing you do real good,

371
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:32,896
but there is a time and a place for
everything, and this ain't that, okay?

372
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,637
Good morning, sugar.
I'm with the gas... company.

373
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,607
What?

374
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,444
It's not gas.

375
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,280
Let me take the baby.

376
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,316
And watch how I do it. I'm
only gonna show you one time.

377
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,752
Right on, Tyrone.

378
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,625
What's your name?

379
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:05,695
Jasmine. And I'm busy.

380
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:09,566
Hey, hey, that's what I
came to talk to you about.

381
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:13,236
I can make you very busy.

382
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,706
Don't let these work clothes fool you none.

383
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:21,278
You're looking at a highly-respected
interior decorator...

384
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,749
who just happen to believe in doing
the important work her own self.

385
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,718
You did all this? I'm doing it.

386
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,556
So, if you'd kindly be about your
business, I'll be about mine.

387
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,925
Hey, lady, cool out!

388
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:38,461
Look, I just thought we might be able
to help each other a little bit.

389
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:42,465
You are a fine looking woman, you know.

390
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,434
Help each other?

391
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,604
Yeah. You're smart too. I can see that now.

392
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:51,641
You think you can help me?
<i>You name the place.</i>

393
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,311
Wonderful.

394
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:58,748
Now, we'll move the dining
room over there in the bay...

395
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,318
and we'll make this the den.

396
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,921
You'll move the couch
perpendicular to the fireplace.

397
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,257
And of course, this china closet...

398
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,259
will go in the bay as well.

399
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,903
Where you goin'? I gotta see Ramon.

400
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,873
Yeah? Why? He copy keys?

401
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,610
I gave him back the key.

402
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:30,447
Yeah, but you can do pretty good with
wax if you know what you're doin'.

403
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,550
Come on.

404
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:37,420
That was Ramon's idea. I
didn't like it from the start.

405
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,757
What are you gonna do? I'm
gonna think about it.

406
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:45,895
You and him meet me at my place
this afternoon at 4:00, 3119, okay?

407
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:52,302
Dillard, tell your pal
that was a really dumb idea.

408
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:55,739
The guys that rig alarms are
the first ones they check.

409
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,576
Turtle!

410
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,065
Nobody move!

411
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,870
Get your hands up.

412
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,572
<i>Keep 'em up.</i>

413
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,708
Gonna put cuffs on.

414
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,693
If he catches you here alone with me...

415
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:54,097
Little Ramon? <i>Â¿Mi amigo Ramoncito?</i>
That's no problem.

416
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,466
You like to live dangerously or what?

417
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,835
It's only the good die young.

418
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,770
Are you a mechanic too?

419
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,473
No, I'm a musician. Yeah, sure.

420
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,109
That's what everybody says. No, listen.

421
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:25,128
My God, it's Ramon!

422
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,531
Good, I gotta talk to him. No,
no, no, you've got to hide.

423
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,935
You know what he'll do if he see you? Hide?

424
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,738
<i>Pasele, Don Garrido.</i>

425
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,674
<i>Venga, Maria.</i>

426
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:42,912
<i>Le presento a Don Fernando
Pablo Jesus y de la Vaca.</i>

427
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,749
My sister Maria Elena Mercedes.

428
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,151
Hi, Fernando. Hi, Maria.

429
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,754
<i>It's a pleasure to see you.</i>

430
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,922
<i>Sientese, Don Fernando.</i>

431
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,494
Â¿Un cafecito?

432
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,763
Traigale un cafe.

433
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,634
How's your family, Don Fernando?

434
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:08,104
<i>They're fine. How is your mother, Maria?</i>

435
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,674
She's away, on family business.

436
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:16,146
I thought Immigration
sent her back to Mexico.

437
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:19,449
But of course,

438
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,752
I never pay any attention to the
malicious gossip of the neighborhood.

439
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:26,055
No. Y es mejor asi.

440
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,731
Sugar? Ahorita se la traigo.

441
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:43,206
<i>Maria, por poco se me queman las entranas.</i>
I'm so terribly sorry!

442
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,141
No, don't worry.

443
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,210
Forgive me! It was my fault...

444
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,979
<i>Voy por una toalla.</i>

445
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:53,183
Hey, Ramon.

446
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:56,653
Senor Dillard. Nice to see you.

447
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:01,691
I want you to meet my friend Don
Fernando Pablo Jesus de la Vaca...

448
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,227
who has kindly come
to call on my sister, Maria.

449
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:08,097
Jesus, Ramon. You pimpin' family now?

450
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,900
You want something? I'm busy.

451
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,603
Weslake's hip to the plan.

452
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,606
He wants us to be at his place at 4:00.

453
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:20,610
What the hell you talk about?
Weslake, he knows!

454
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,713
He's got the key and the wax both. Shit!

455
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:26,216
No, no, over there in the corner.

456
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:34,691
I guess I was wrong. It was better before.

457
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,627
No! No!

458
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,831
Everything looks just fine just like this.

459
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,201
Wouldn't change a thing.

460
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,938
You know, I had you figured
for some lazy pimp.

461
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,674
Who me? Lazy?

462
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,143
I ain't no lowlife.

463
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,679
Anyway, thanks.

464
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,648
Thanks?

465
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,150
That's it?

466
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,554
You got something special in mind?

467
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,913
Ham hocks and red beans?

468
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,754
Not bad for a second choice.

469
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:43,826
Take your time, man.

470
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,796
The food won't run away.

471
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,798
Time.

472
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,934
I gotta go.

473
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:59,275
Where you going? Gotta take
care of a little business.

474
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,111
Right?

475
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,015
How about dinner tomorrow night?

476
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,792
This is 24th Street? Right.

477
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,761
She works for two guys who live together.

478
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,065
They go up to the Russian
River every weekend.

479
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:26,736
And upstairs? Upstairs, another
guy who's also pretty.

480
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,740
An artiste. He's usually out for the night.

481
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:34,277
Cruises North Beach all weekend.
First floor?

482
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:38,681
First floor. Landlady, Mrs. O'Malley.

483
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,284
Deaf as a stone.

484
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,953
What is it?

485
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:48,758
I think it's ham hocks and red beans.

486
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,261
Open the door.

487
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:55,632
This is the front room?

488
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,834
Yeah. Let me see.

489
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:00,837
Yeah, right. Well, you see this is the den.

490
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,973
This used to be the dining
room. We switched them around.

491
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,909
<i>- But this is 24th Street?
- Yeah, of course.</i>

492
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,354
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

493
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,723
You? What you doin' here?

494
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:23,726
Hey, man, I ain't said nothin'.
He didn't say anything.

495
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:27,764
I saw Dillard palm the key myself. So?

496
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:31,734
So, I figured if you start out that dumb,
you need all the help you can get.

497
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:35,905
You got a better idea? You
bet your ass, Pancho.

498
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:39,409
Come here. My name is Ramon. What is it?

499
00:44:39,411 --> 00:44:42,311
<i>Sit down. You in or you out?</i>

500
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,348
<i>How I know until I hear a plan?</i>

501
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,285
The only thing you gotta know
is your plan sucks...

502
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:53,256
and my plan takes us to Hawaii... the safe.

503
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:56,993
I'm listening. Okay.

504
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,195
I'll accept that.

505
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:04,267
<i>My plan is simplicity itself.</i>

506
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:07,870
<i>We break in, and we hit the safe.</i>

507
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,775
<i>How do we do that?</i>

508
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,911
We use an expert. Who?

509
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:18,414
Old friend of mine. A locksmith...

510
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:22,985
with an interesting sideline in old safes,

511
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,088
if you get my meaning.

512
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,423
Gentlemen?

513
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,862
<i>What the hell do you mean,
you won't, you can't?</i>

514
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:35,264
<i>Absolutely not! But on the phone...</i>

515
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,934
I'm only out of the joint a month!

516
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:41,938
They catch me again, they throw
the key away! Forget it!

517
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,942
I shouldn't even be
consorting with you guys!

518
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:49,846
But you... Do you know they'll
look for any excuse...

519
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:51,781
to revoke parole?

520
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,450
The cops don't like short people.

521
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:59,122
But I said I could help and I will.

522
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:12,502
I'll show you how to open a safe!

523
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,923
Voila!

524
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:37,560
Now, the secret of cracking
boxes... opening safes to you...

525
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:41,297
Is based on the presumption that what
is on the inside can be outside.

526
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,466
And what is on the outside...

527
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,935
Stop eating! We'll have intermission later!

528
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:50,339
That is, you desire what is on
the outside to be on the inside.

529
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,810
<i>Hey, can you show us how to get in?</i>
And what is on the inside...

530
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,279
Sure!

531
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,913
Jesus, that's fantastic.

532
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:33,049
Thank you. Looks easy.

533
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:35,418
I know, but it isn't. Yeah,
but you can teach us.

534
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,054
I doubt it. Besides, it takes years.

535
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:41,123
How we gonna do it then? Patience.

536
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:45,595
The secret for safes is patience.

537
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:50,266
Especially when we use
the historically important...

538
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,468
circular saw.

539
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,138
<i>Weslake, you turn and you oil.</i>

540
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,085
Lazzarelli, this is gonna take forever.
Precisely!

541
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,287
That's why it's only of a
passing interest. Lazzarelli!

542
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:14,657
How do we get into the safe?

543
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,496
- Soup!
- Soup?

544
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,632
Soup! Soup?

545
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:27,236
Soup. A nitroglycerin compound,
only not quite so dangerous.

546
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:32,241
How does it work? Two
wires, electrical outlet,

547
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:37,313
a drop of soup on the hinges or
in the lock, and "open sesame!"

548
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:45,421
Try it on this. Lift that sawhorse
up for me, will you, Ramon?

549
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,556
Okay.

550
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:54,096
Watch it with that stuff, Dillard!
He said it was safe.

551
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,399
Yeah, well, it is. You just
gotta be a little careful.

552
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,601
That battery work? Yeah.

553
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,603
Okay, come on. Try it on here.

554
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,105
No, you do it. You're the electrician.

555
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,541
Hey, Weslake, what's that
shit supposed to do?

556
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:08,010
Just watch and see.

557
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,515
You got it live for God's sakes!

558
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,723
Soup!

559
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:24,093
A nitroglycerin compound,

560
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:26,395
two wires,

561
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:28,564
an electrical outlet,

562
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,734
one drop of soup...

563
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:36,572
and... "open sesame."

564
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:09,372
<i>Yo, fellas!</i>

565
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,408
<i>Â¿- Que pasa, hombre?</i>
- Hey, Maxine!

566
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,444
We're out for a little
bounce, right, Fernando?

567
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:22,084
That's all I wanted! <i>Buenas noches.
Don Ramon, Â¿que tal?</i>

568
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:24,387
<i>How is my future in-law?</i> I...

569
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,223
<i>Como esta su</i> beautiful sister Maria?

570
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:34,663
Hey, we don't want to throw off
our schedule, right, Friday?

571
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,566
I mean, Ferdie!

572
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:47,276
Man, you dropped my foot!

573
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,148
Dillard, you need a doctor.

574
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,350
No, doctors. They have
to talk to the police.

575
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:57,319
Yeah, they give you downers.
I can't get behind downers.

576
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,222
Well, Maria can fix it.

577
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,225
Yeah, Maria can fix it!

578
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,716
Okay, I'll walk you home.

579
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:35,624
I don't know if I can make it home.

580
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,860
I think I better sleep here tonight.

581
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,462
Jasmine is no longer in our employ.

582
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:49,265
When she was, she wasn't a decorator.

583
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,467
Well, she moved all that stuff. That.

584
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,270
Just a whim. But if you do
windows, we could use...

585
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:57,606
Nah, nah. I don't do anything
you want, man. Nothin'!

586
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,909
<i>Non gustibus disputandum est.</i>

587
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,845
Say, man, why don't you just watch
your mouth! Now, where is she?

588
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,914
No idea.

589
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,417
But if you find her, tell her we'd
love to have our silver back.

590
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:11,253
What silver? Just mention it if you see her!

591
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,190
She didn't take your damn silver, man!

592
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:16,559
All right.

593
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,263
Hey, what is this? What
are you all doin' here?

594
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,432
We just wanted to make
sure you got off okay.

595
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,768
I'll get off okay if you get out of my way.

596
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,471
Come on, move, She'll kill me if I'm late.

597
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,507
Let's go.

598
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,742
Here, lock it.

599
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:52,661
Turtle. Here, look.

600
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,663
<i>First of the season.</i>

601
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,499
Incredible!

602
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,602
Incredible.

603
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,637
<i>What's so incredible? It's only a salmon.</i>

604
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,833
We have to approach this as if
it was a military exercise.

605
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:34,303
Timing, precision, coordination,

606
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,905
teamwork, skill, courage.

607
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:40,276
That's hip, that John Wayne shit.

608
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,279
You're not gonna bring that
with you, are you?

609
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:46,448
We can't get through there.
I got that front all wired.

610
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,417
You didn't wire the back, did you?

611
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,453
The back's just a solid wall. Precisely.

612
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,556
We are gonna go through that
wall from the apartment...

613
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:57,726
on the second floor of the building
next to the O'Malley building.

614
00:54:57,728 --> 00:55:00,796
That's how we get to the safe.
We get into that building...

615
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,399
from the coal chute on 23rd Street...

616
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:07,503
and that's where we meet
this morning at 0200. Okay?

617
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,072
0200. Okay. Okay.

618
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:15,311
Bolt cutter cuts the coal chute lock.

619
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,381
Turtle goes into the coal
chute and up the stairs.

620
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,418
You open the front door of the building.

621
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,723
We force open the door of the apartment
upstairs. Did you get the crowbar?

622
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,759
You got a tire iron in the
trunk of that pink thing?

623
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,062
No sweat.

624
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,598
We then use the jack...

625
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,101
to go through the wall
into Garvey's upstairs.

626
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,603
- Jack, Ramon?
- Crank type, right?

627
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,539
<i>Right.</i>

628
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:46,575
<i>Drill?</i> Not to worry.

629
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:51,347
Okay, I figure all that
should take about 17 minutes.

630
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:55,084
So, at 0221 we are
downstairs and at the safe.

631
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:56,919
Hawaii!

632
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,122
Shut up. 0222:

633
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:03,392
We use the plasticene
and Dillard wires the hinges.

634
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:07,730
Two drops of soup, electrical outlet and...
Open sesame!

635
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,699
Okay. Alibis. Ramon?

636
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:14,903
I don't need one. I don't even
supposed to be in this country.

637
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:20,042
A black man don't need one.
Law don't believe him anyway.

638
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:25,681
- Dillard?
- I figured I'd say I was with you.

639
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,051
I have an alibi.

640
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,827
I forgot.

641
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,929
<i>I'll check you out later on, okay?</i>

642
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,065
Okay.

643
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,170
Come with me. We'll get the jack.

644
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:52,474
I gotta get some wire for the soup.
Okay, we'll do that on the way.

645
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,611
Well, special wire.

646
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,746
Okay.

647
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,811
<i>Mami, estoy muy cansada.</i>

648
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,813
<i>Andale, ya.</i>

649
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:38,187
<i>Mama!</i>

650
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,802
Say, what the hell you think you doin'?

651
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,506
Getting ready for work. What kind
of work you dressed for like that?

652
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:00,175
Well, you know. Girl, you crazy.

653
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:03,011
I didn't like being an interior decorator.

654
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:06,648
The customer's never satisfied.
What you doing?

655
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,985
Gettin' you off the street. Certain people
are real protective of their territory,

656
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,254
and we're on it.

657
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:14,790
<i>You're standing me up, aren't you?</i>

658
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:18,861
It's not standing you up if I tell
you I can't make it beforehand.

659
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,563
<i>You can't do this to me.
There's no reason to do it.</i>

660
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:25,100
<i>With all the crime in this city,
you're giving out tickets!</i>

661
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:27,970
Why don't you do something
about real criminals?

662
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,839
Weslake, I expected better from you.

663
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:35,177
This is awfully short notice, you know, and
it's not easy in San Francisco these days.

664
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,246
Maxie, it's just one night.

665
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:40,048
It was just two minutes! Come on!

666
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,585
Maxie, I will make it up to you, I swear!

667
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:46,088
I can't make up a lost Saturday night.

668
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:51,827
But next Thursday you might
be on your back in Paris.

669
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,929
France!

670
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:57,933
Come on, Weslake, you know you'll
never have to deliver on that one.

671
00:58:57,935 --> 00:59:00,969
Why? Because I have to be
back here on Friday...

672
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:04,640
for Don Fernando.

673
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:08,944
Well, we could have dinner
at Chez Panisse. Yes?

674
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:12,281
Just don't ever let this happen again.
Do you understand?

675
00:59:12,283 --> 00:59:14,783
Yes, sir.

676
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,718
<i>Okay, I'll move the car.</i>

677
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,622
<i>I hate the car. I'll move the car.</i>
Hey, fella.

678
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,293
You busy tonight?

679
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:26,328
What are you doin', honey?

680
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:36,138
Ramon, you gotta let me
explain about last night.

681
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,809
I was only taking Maxine home.

682
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:45,247
I certainly didn't mean to be disrespectful
to your lovely sister Maria.

683
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:50,185
In fact, I have a small
token of my affection.

684
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:54,856
- I come to wash up.
<i>- Why you won't let me?</i>

685
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,659
You ain't gonna whore for two reasons.

686
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,629
It's skilled labor.

687
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,664
You gotta learn before you earn.

688
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:06,635
Nobody gonna be payin' you $500 a
night just because you look good.

689
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,771
Five hundred dollars.

690
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,143
What's a $500-a-night whore do?

691
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:20,182
See? There ain't no such
thing as a $500 whore,

692
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,985
just $500 johns.

693
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,087
There's tricks to walkin'.
There's tricks to talkin'.

694
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,289
You could teach me.

695
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,159
Now that brings us to the second
reason why you can't whore.

696
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,362
Which is?

697
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:37,232
You're too smart. You're too pretty.

698
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,109
Damn it.

699
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:52,981
The keys to the apartment.

700
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,784
Here, let me take care of that for you.

701
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:59,788
How come? Let's just say,

702
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,892
I give them the keys, show them how
honest you are, we split the silver.

703
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,261
What silver? Come on, now.

704
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,797
This is Boardwalk you're talkin' to.

705
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,200
The silver you took when you was decoratin'.

706
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,970
They say that I took their silver?
It's cool.

707
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:18,140
We won't take it to Garvey. We'll go
uptown and get some real money for it.

708
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:21,443
Damn it to hell, Boardwalk!
You're just like 'em!

709
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,980
Any time they lose something with
all their damn furniture movin',

710
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,115
they have to blame the nigger maid.

711
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,317
The same damn thing
happen at the last place.

712
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:31,787
The old lady say I broke her Cuisinart.

713
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,823
I can't even run a damn
Cuisinart, but she fired me!

714
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:38,126
And it's gonna happen again and again and...

715
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:51,440
That's right.

716
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:54,943
I ain't no decorator.

717
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:57,913
I'm a maid, and I was a good one too.

718
01:01:57,915 --> 01:02:03,051
But now I ain't got a job, and I
wish I had taken their damn silver!

719
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:07,089
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

720
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,825
<i>I knew you wasn't no decorator.</i>

721
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:13,261
Didn't make no difference to me.

722
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,364
'Cause you got a pretty face.

723
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:20,802
You got a pretty name. Jasmine.

724
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:25,941
<i>What?</i>

725
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:29,845
My name is Betty.

726
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,314
I made up "Jasmine."

727
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:39,788
Come on, come on, it's okay.

728
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,924
It's all right.

729
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:46,862
You think my mama named me "Boardwalk"?

730
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,808
Now, don't... Don't you worry.

731
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,244
I got something goin'.

732
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,947
After tonight you gonna be workin' for me.

733
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,184
But you said I didn't know how.

734
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:11,253
No, not that.

735
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:15,824
I'm gonna be needin' a personal secretary.

736
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:18,126
Maybe you can start tonight.

737
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:22,297
<i>Take care of Tyrone for me.
I mean, if it's cool.</i>

738
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:31,306
I wouldn't mind you teachin'
me some of that stuff.

739
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,408
<i>What stuff?</i>

740
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,948
That stuff.

741
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,879
Mama!

742
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:13,882
<i>I' Ramoncito, mi hijo!</i>

743
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:16,351
<i>I' Mi hijo!</i>

744
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,621
<i>Gracias, mi hijo. Gracias.</i>

745
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:22,090
I want you to meet Don Dillard.

746
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,960
He's been so good
to take care of la Maria...

747
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:27,462
while I was away and you were so busy.

748
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:29,631
Nice to meet you.

749
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:32,100
<i>I' Ramon! I' Con respeto!</i>

750
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:37,072
Nice to meet you, Don Dillard.

751
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:44,212
<i>Testing, one, two, three, four.</i>

752
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:55,590
What's so funny over there?
You havin' a good time?

753
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:01,496
Weslake, I this is just
the most wonderful party.

754
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:04,399
Do you think I could have
a little more champagne?

755
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,002
You're so generous. What time is it?

756
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:10,105
<i>It's 2:30 by my watch,
but I think I'm a little slow.</i>

757
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,440
Is it 2:35 over there?

758
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:19,247
Telephone! Boardwalk, for you.

759
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,316
Hey, kids!

760
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,460
<i>Aw, man, wait a minute.</i>

761
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:36,598
You contractors all have such
a wonderful time at parties.

762
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,201
I'm amazed. This is terribly
well-organized, the way you've done it.

763
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:44,306
<i>- Man, come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute!</i>

764
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,474
Dillard's gonna play the guitar.

765
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:49,945
Hang on and listen. Shut up, everybody,
and let Dillard play the guitar.

766
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:14,269
Where the hell is he?

767
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,545
Everybody here? Yeah!

768
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,616
Okay, synchronize watches.

769
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,752
Fifty-three.

770
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:33,254
Fifty-four.

771
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:36,157
Fif...

772
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,701
Sixty.

773
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,504
Okay, let's go. The coal chute.

774
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,674
Hey, Boardwalk. What?

775
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,410
The keys. I ain't got no keys.

776
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,546
Ramon says he saw you
at La Rondall with the scrub.

777
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,682
He said she gave 'em to you.
She changed her mind.

778
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:04,686
The keys are not part of the plan.
We stick to the plan.

779
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:15,463
Bolt cutter.

780
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:21,136
Bolt cutter!

781
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,600
Good.

782
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,238
Ready? Yeah.

783
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,143
When you get to the bottom, go up the
stairs and let us in the front door, okay?

784
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,479
Okay. I'll help you down.

785
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,414
Good.

786
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:16,691
Turtle?

787
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:28,303
Turtle?

788
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:32,774
Are you all right?

789
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,845
What are you doin'?

790
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:40,148
The door is stuck.

791
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,719
All right. Get him out of there.

792
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:55,296
Okay. Plan "B."

793
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,465
Piece of cake. Fire escape.

794
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,567
We go around and up, over the skylight,

795
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:03,138
down the shaft, in through the window.
Simple. Come on.

796
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,574
Get down!

797
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,784
Piece of cake.

798
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,920
Dillard?

799
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,364
Okay, I got it.

800
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,603
Okay, go on up.

801
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,309
<i>Turtle, go ahead.</i>

802
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:47,215
<i>Boardwalk, go!</i>

803
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:51,586
Ramon... go!

804
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,589
What's the matter? The tool bag.

805
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:57,425
I'll take the goddamn tool bag.

806
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,396
Come on.

807
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:06,301
<i>Now what?</i> I don't like ladders.

808
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,803
This is a hell of a time to mention it!

809
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,772
Nobody asked me before.

810
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,284
Where's Ramon?

811
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:25,286
He wouldn't climb the ladder.

812
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:28,289
That's cool. Just more for us.

813
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:31,292
No way, man. He's part of the team.

814
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:34,495
He is, That's funny, 'cause I don't see him.

815
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:37,832
We're already four minutes and
28 seconds behind schedule.

816
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,501
Come on, let's go.

817
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:47,375
Say, man, you sure this
thing's gonna hold us up?

818
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:51,779
Yeah, it's plate. Just
don't walk on the glass.

819
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:56,784
Just go on carefully and brace yourself
against the edge of it, like this.

820
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:59,287
Careful.

821
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:02,423
Easy, Turtle.

822
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,426
- Freeze!
- Shit!

823
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,664
<i>Welcome to my little atelier.</i>

824
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:15,503
So this is the, thing
you were talking about.

825
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:24,479
It's so big.

826
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:26,814
What I'm trying to do with it...

827
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:29,917
I-I-I'm trying to explore the
interplay of light and shadow...

828
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,920
as it moves through space.

829
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,325
It's very sexy.

830
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,661
Maxine, you promised me.

831
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,863
Maybe I lied.

832
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:46,067
<i>You're gonna tell me
everything about your mother.</i>

833
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:48,870
<i>Now put the music on.</i>

834
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:55,877
Maxine, what are you doing?
Helping you relax.

835
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:59,947
- I'm very relaxed.
- Your toes are clenched.

836
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,597
<i>Psst, here.</i>

837
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:32,980
This is one of my favorite
pieces of music. What is it?

838
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,950
<i>The Nutcracker.</i>

839
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,987
Really? "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."

840
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:43,458
How sweet.

841
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,028
Well, it just makes me
feel like moving in space.

842
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,753
She's a wonderful dancer.

843
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,175
Maxine. Wha... No.

844
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:37,044
What are you doing? Stop. We
already talked about this.

845
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,947
I know, honey. I just had another thought.

846
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:44,419
Maxine! Don't worry. That's the good part.

847
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:49,757
I get to show you. <i>Maxine!</i>

848
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:53,828
<i>Relax. I'll do the hard part.</i>

849
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:57,665
Atta boy, tiger!

850
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:01,769
<i>Jesus, you're kinkier than I thought.</i>

851
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:14,982
Come on! I got all stiff.

852
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,885
In the leg, man.

853
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,161
That's the window over there.

854
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,197
<i>Do we have to do this?</i>

855
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,234
<i>Turtle! Come on.</i>

856
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,755
The soup!

857
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,236
Dillard. Boardwalk stepped on my damn hand.

858
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:10,571
Glass cutter.

859
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,989
It's got no cutter! Shit!

860
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:32,293
<i>That's the way I would have
done it in the first place.</i>

861
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:34,729
Just shut up and show us the way.

862
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:42,870
We are one hour and 23
minutes behind schedule.

863
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,873
Where are we? You're in the dining room.

864
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,877
No, no, that's the den. W-Wait a minute.

865
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,780
One, two, three, That used
to be the living room.

866
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:55,716
Four, five, six,

867
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,252
seven, eight...

868
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:02,323
<i>What took you so much?</i> Ramon?

869
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:04,091
<i>How'd you get in?</i>

870
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:08,062
Okay, I saw the meter maidcome
in the front with this guy,

871
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:12,166
so I put my foot on the door. Good,

872
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:15,603
Good. Did you know she was in here?

873
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:18,339
Yeah, yeah, we knew. But how
did you get in this place?

874
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,075
<i>Did you break in to this apartment?</i> No.

875
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:24,312
The door, it was open.

876
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,916
Yeah. All right, all right.

877
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:32,620
Let's go. Ten, eleven...

878
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,723
Boardwalk, drill right there.

879
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,927
What are you doin'?

880
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:43,764
I gotta find a spot. Just drill there.

881
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,033
<i>All right. You're the boss.</i>

882
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:57,111
You hit the water pipe! You
told me to drill here!

883
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:03,017
<i>He'll be so happy to see you.</i>

884
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:06,320
<i>You're such a little gypsy.</i>

885
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:10,291
I'll turn on the light. There you go.

886
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,860
Now, there, you're home.

887
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:24,205
<i>Hello? Mr. Monicelli?</i>

888
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:28,409
<i>This is Vera O'Malley, your neighbor.</i>

889
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:32,813
I just wanted you to know
that my idea worked.

890
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:37,885
I left the door open
and the kitty came back.

891
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:43,824
What? You wanted her out? How come?

892
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:51,799
<i>Well, never mind.
I know why you wanted her out.</i>

893
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:55,136
Just a second. I'll get her.

894
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:58,139
- Naughty kitty.
- Get the cat.

895
01:17:58,141 --> 01:18:00,274
<i>Naughty kitty.</i>

896
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:13,954
Okay. I put the kitty out again.

897
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:18,826
But I'm afraid you're going to have a
little cleanup to do when you get home.

898
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:22,930
Yes, I got the key.

899
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:26,834
<i>No, it wasn't Jasmine who brought it.</i>

900
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:31,972
A friend of hers. A nice colored gentleman.

901
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:36,143
A real fancy dresser, I'll tell you.

902
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:38,245
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

903
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,457
Okay. Over here.

904
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:51,392
Move the furniture.

905
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:54,095
"Nice colored gentleman," What?

906
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:56,964
I get it. You have the hard-on for the maid.

907
01:18:56,966 --> 01:19:01,736
You talkin' to me, man? I don't care about
no maid. Besides, she's a decorator.

908
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:04,972
You had the key! It doesn't
make any difference.

909
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:08,442
If he had used the key, they could have
traced it to him and nailed all of us.

910
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:11,078
Now, get to work! Exactly!

911
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:18,419
Dillard, Ramon, bring that couch.

912
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,566
Turn.

913
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,481
<i>We're nearly there.</i>

914
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:34,595
Damn! This shit's harder than workin'!

915
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:19,273
We are four hours and 17
minutes behind schedule.

916
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:22,243
Now, let's do it, and let's
do it right this time.

917
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:31,185
<i>Aw, shit. Wrong wire.</i>

918
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,087
<i>Perfect.</i>

919
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,367
Frijoles.

920
01:21:46,369 --> 01:21:50,604
<i>Red beans and ham hocks.</i>

921
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,076
It's good.

922
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:59,580
Yeah. Jasmine's all right.

923
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,582
She can cook.

924
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,984
It needs chilies.

925
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:08,055
It don't need nothin'.
It's great just the way it is.

926
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:10,424
Soup. Okay. <i>Soup.</i>

927
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:14,695
Careful. Right in there.

928
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,997
There.

929
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:32,012
Don't let that loose wire
touch the terminal yet.

930
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,148
We're gonna blow it.

931
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,083
If you wanna help, get out of the way.

932
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,588
<i>Ramon, give me some light.</i>

933
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:49,129
Everybody set?

934
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:52,466
Here we go to Hawaii.

935
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:58,399
The fish was too much for her.

936
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:01,568
She just looked at it and...

937
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,238
smiled...

938
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,807
and closed her eyes forever.

939
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:09,710
Your mother?

940
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:13,714
You know her last word?

941
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:16,550
Lox.

942
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,224
Yeah, she loved salmon.

943
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,428
She used to cure it herself;

944
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,464
A little dill, a little brandy.

945
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:34,635
Come on.

946
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:37,438
Feel better.

947
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,573
Sit down.

948
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:48,582
I'm real sorry, Garvey.
That's a tough one, man.

949
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,717
<i>Mis pesames, Garvey.</i>

950
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:56,557
Yeah, that mother stuff's a
heavy gig, man. I'm sorry.

951
01:24:56,559 --> 01:25:01,728
Well, I'm glad you're all here.

952
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,731
I don't know what I would have done.

953
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:08,435
Would you like some...

954
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:13,540
Here, have some salmon.

955
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:21,682
You'll like that. Have a drink.

956
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:25,619
<i>Salud. Salud.</i>

957
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:32,392
Piece of fish?

958
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:10,230
The key! The key! The key!

959
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:12,166
The key, where is it?

960
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:26,313
Okay, buster! Hold it, right there!
I got him, I got him!

961
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:28,916
Move! Move!

962
01:26:28,918 --> 01:26:32,038
Get your hands on the counter! Move!

963
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,500
What are you doin'? What do you want?

964
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:49,236
We heard your alarm.
We caught this guy red-handed.

965
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:51,271
<i>Caught this guy?</i>

966
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:54,241
We just gave him the key to turn it off.

967
01:26:54,243 --> 01:26:56,343
It was an accident. Forget it.

968
01:26:56,345 --> 01:26:59,880
Looks like they came in
from the apartment behind,

969
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,516
<i>came down the stairs.</i>

970
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,736
Where were you two?

971
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:26,340
If it weren't for my friends
here, I'd have nothing.

972
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,844
Here you are arresting the heroes.

973
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,616
Heroes?

974
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:38,385
Did any of you heroes get a description?

975
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:40,554
They were black. They was Mexican.

976
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,925
They had ski masks.

977
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:47,294
Right! It was ski masks.

978
01:27:47,296 --> 01:27:50,397
Black Mexicans wearin' ski masks.

979
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,534
Come on, Ronnie.

980
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,348
<i>You should have been here, Garvey.</i>

981
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,684
I really scared one of them big suckers.

982
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:12,953
I appreciate that.

983
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:16,623
They do any damage? A little.

984
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:20,627
But I'm sure we'll be able
to put it back together.

985
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:24,331
That'll be nice.

986
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,601
Well, you guys are friends indeed.

987
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,306
This salmon won't keep.

988
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:44,651
You know, Weslake, those
robbers were pretty dumb.

989
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,753
I wouldn't say that.

990
01:28:46,755 --> 01:28:51,591
I thought it was a pretty professional job.

991
01:28:51,593 --> 01:28:56,096
The safe, I only had it for the picture.

992
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:59,099
There hasn't been anything in it for years.

993
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:01,468
Wasn't even locked.

994
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:07,774
<i>What's the difference.</i>

995
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:12,913
<i>Friendship, that's what's important.</i>

996
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:16,783
But, in the meantime, you'll have to do.
