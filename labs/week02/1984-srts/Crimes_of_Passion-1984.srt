00:00:01,893 --> 00:00:04,951
<i>I'm Barry Sandler, I wrote the
screenplay for "Crimes of Passion"..</i>

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:08,751
<i>and uh.. I wanted to discuss some
of these uh.. scenes that we..</i>

3
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:12,085
<i>left out of the film and uh..
and why we did.</i>

4
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:17,449
<i>This is a scene uh.. that uh..</i>

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,637
<i>I particularly liked and.. and
Ken did as well but..</i>

6
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,882
<i>we had to lose it basically for uh..</i>

7
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:27,062
<i>uh.. it interrupted the momentum
of o..</i>

8
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,783
<i>where we're going dramatically.
These are uh..</i>

9
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:34,119
<i>two guys who are both going
through their own.. uh..</i>

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,622
<i>confusion and conflict about..</i>

11
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:42,228
<i>you know, where they are in their lives
and in terms of their relationships
with women. Uh.. Hopper has uh..</i>

12
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:46,257
<i>divorced Sheila and.. and Grady
is going through his own..</i>

13
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>his own confusion and they're um..</i>

14
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:53,626
<i>kind of musing about
an incident that uh..</i>

15
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>took place in the past.</i>

16
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,982
<i>where uh.. you know,
kind of uh.. you know..</i>

17
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:02,792
<i>yeah, kind of uh.. uh..</i>

18
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,296
<i>an incident from um..
their.. their youth..</i>

19
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,858
<i>and um..</i>

20
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,530
<i>they're basically um..</i>

21
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:20,494
<i>It.. it's a scene that I wrote uh..
that's really..</i>

22
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:23,098
<i>not about exactly what they're
talking about but..</i>

23
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,817
<i>what they're.. they're doing is
kind of letting out their own..</i>

24
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,886
<i>concern for what's going on in their
present lives by musing about the past.</i>

25
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,656
<i>And uh..</i>

26
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,090
<i>it's uh..</i>

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,282
<i>it's a.. it's a scene that reveals..</i>

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>Grady's attitude about
sex and about um..</i>

29
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:46,766
<i>um.. being faithful to one woman..</i>

30
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:50,294
<i>and um..
it uh..</i>

31
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:55,222
<i>it.. it.. it basically is a scene where
we use it as for the past..</i>

32
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:56,810
<i>to.. to really reveal..</i>

33
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,192
<i>what he's going through in..
in the present.</i>

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,647
<i>uh..his own guilt about
breaking up with Amy, his own uh..</i>

35
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:05,811
<i>his own need to uh..</i>

36
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,959
<i>to explore uh.. uh.. his sexuality..</i>

37
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:13,588
<i>with uh.. Joanna and um..</i>

38
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:17,614
<i>and um.. his own sense of regret about uh..</i>

39
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:20,210
<i>what he and Amy had,
but they no longer have.</i>

40
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:22,620
<i>And uh.. it's a.. it's a..</i>

41
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,938
<i>it's a bittersweet scene and..</i>

42
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:29,674
<i>and I miss the fact that it's not in the
movie, however I understand why it's
not in the movie, because..</i>

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,978
<i>uh.. it would've interrupted the..</i>

44
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,537
<i>flow that Ken was trying to build,
the momentum..</i>

45
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,765
<i>of going from the HP scene,
to the scene with Amy..</i>

46
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:43,148
<i>and uh.. Grady in a bedroom.
And.. um..</i>

47
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:50,136
<i>we needed that.. direct reaction
to that HP scene. To uh.. create the..</i>

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,897
<i>tension and the ultimate explosion
uh.. in the bedroom..</i>

49
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,029
<i>between Grady and Amy that
then gives uh.. Grady the uh..</i>

50
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:05,143
<i>the.. the antagonism,
the incentive to uh..</i>

51
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,619
<i>to go to Joanna.</i>

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,214
<i>This scene uh..</i>

53
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,267
<i>i.. i.. is a..</i>

54
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,502
<i>I miss the scene not
being in the film um..</i>

55
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,898
<i>for one reason only, I mean uh.. uh..</i>

56
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,602
<i>I think it's.. it's a very talky scene
and uh.. the scene itself..</i>

57
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:31,714
<i>um.. I.. I.. I don't particularly miss
but I miss the fact that we're not
seeing this other side of Amy.</i>

58
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,192
<i>What the scene showed was..</i>

59
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:38,143
<i>um.. Amy's own uh.. guilt, Amy's own..</i>

60
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:42,291
<i>sense of regret, her own awareness..
that the marriage isn't working..</i>

61
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:47,516
<i>and that she's partly to blame and I
think she blames herself for..
for um.. uh..</i>

62
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:50,935
<i>for not being a better wife or for
not being a little more understanding..</i>

63
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,522
<i>for maybe taking out her
frustrations on Bobby.</i>

64
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,535
<i>And um..</i>

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,815
<i>unfortunately, the reason why is not
in the film is um..</i>

66
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:04,253
<i>basically, uh.. uh.. a matter of time.
I.. we had to..</i>

67
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,213
<i>cut somewhere, we had uh..
uh.. lengthy first cut..</i>

68
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,845
<i>and um..</i>

69
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,491
<i>Ken didn't want to cut from uh..</i>

70
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,550
<i>uh.. either Kathleen or Tony..</i>

71
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,217
<i>and um.. unfortunately as good as..
as Annie Potts in the scene..</i>

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,211
<i>uh.. it's uh.. she's..</i>

73
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:25,875
<i>uh.. she's not one of the uh..
three leads and uh..</i>

74
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,855
<i>fell victim to uh..</i>

75
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:31,402
<i>the fact that.. you know,
it's.. it's not a movie about Amy.</i>

76
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:32,812
<i>And um..</i>

77
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:37,091
<i>you know, you have to uh.. make these..</i>

78
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:41,342
<i>creative decisions that sometime hurt
the film or sometimes hurt a character
in the film.</i>

79
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:44,533
<i>It's uh.. it probably did in this case,
because it does show..</i>

80
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:48,030
<i>another side to Amy, it does show um..</i>

81
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:52,022
<i>uh.. of the fact that she's not just
a whiny wife, that she..</i>

82
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:56,539
<i>has her own uh.. frustrations
and her own confusions..</i>

83
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,491
<i>and her own uh..</i>

84
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,916
<i>realization that uh..
she's taking a.. uh..</i>

85
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,025
<i>a lot of that out on Bobby.</i>

86
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:09,102
<i>and uh.. here she's uh.. she's
expressing her own regret, her own pain.</i>

87
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:13,082
<i>She does love him but she know it's..
it's not working out, she knows that the..</i>

88
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:17,668
<i>uh.. the.. there's a..
a growing distance between them.</i>

89
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:22,226
<i>She's aware of it, she's aware that
she's probably responsible
to some degree for uh..</i>

90
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,411
<i>for the marriage falling apart..</i>

91
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,464
<i>and uh... that she really feels
a sadness about it.</i>

92
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:03,155
<i>This is the scene where Bobby uh.. comes
to Joanna after breaking up with Amy.</i>

93
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:07,306
<i>and.. they try to uh.. have sex on..</i>

94
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:12,722
<i>uh.. in terms of reality, in terms of
Joanna and Grady, rather than
China Blue and Grady.</i>

95
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,058
<i>And uh.. Joanna can't go
through with it..</i>

96
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,225
<i>uh.. she's still is dealing with
her own problems of intimacy..</i>

97
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,609
<i>and her own inability to
uh.. relate to a.. man.</i>

98
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,849
<i>as herself..
and um..</i>

99
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:30,264
<i>she's making all kinds of excuses and..
and he can't quite accept it.</i>

100
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:35,454
<i>This poor guy has just come from uh..
his own breakup and uh.. he's uh..</i>

101
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,393
<i>wildly attracted and.. and
in love this woman..</i>

102
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,402
<i>and uh..</i>

103
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,089
<i>he can't make it work with her either,
so it's..</i>

104
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,152
<i>it's own conflict, his own uh..
frustration..</i>

105
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,006
<i>as well as hers, that she can't deal</i>

106
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,717
<i>with uh.. someone who's at least reaching
out to her, attempting to reach out..</i>

107
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,408
<i>to her as Joanna rather than
as China Blue and um..</i>

108
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,289
<i>we lost the scene..</i>

109
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:04,443
<i>unfortunately because uh..
Ken wanted to..</i>

110
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:09,656
<i>re.. reconstruct the um..</i>

111
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:14,648
<i>the relationship.. uh.. so that..</i>

112
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:19,497
<i>we lost this middle beat. Uh.. he felt
we didn't need the middle beat that we..</i>

113
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,957
<i>that um..</i>

114
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,236
<i>it uh..</i>

115
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,536
<i>it.. that was expendable and
when he went to..</i>

116
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,182
<i>to edit the film..</i>

117
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,781
<i>he felt that they went
for a better flow..</i>

118
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,527
<i>without this particular scene.
That uh..</i>

119
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:40,851
<i>we knew that they were going to
get together at some point anyway,
that this particular scene..</i>

120
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:44,382
<i>uh.. just uh.. delayed.. that.</i>

121
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,655
<i>That she was not able to relinquish
the control at that particular moment,</i>

122
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,210
<i>ah.. that she grows into that control..</i>

123
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,028
<i>ah.. eventually.</i>

124
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,819
<i>I felt was important and I thought, you
know, we lost that particular moment.</i>

125
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,939
<i>This is the scene where uh..</i>

126
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,267
<i>Joanna uh..comes to Grady
after her breakthrough..</i>

127
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:44,702
<i>after her.. her catharsis with
the scene with uh.. Ben.</i>

128
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>Where she's now able
to try to reach out..</i>

129
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:52,228
<i>to uh.. Grady and.. and..</i>

130
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,303
<i>at least attempt to um..</i>

131
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,848
<i>uh.. um.. make a..</i>

132
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,874
<i>at least attempts at intimacy.</i>

133
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,907
<i>And uh.. we lost the scene..</i>

134
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:13,392
<i>Yeah, I.. I believe because of the
reconstruct in terms of um..</i>

135
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,126
<i>uh.. the Joanna and Bobby relationship.</i>

136
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:22,457
<i>When uh.. Ken edited it.. uh..</i>

137
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:26,188
<i>we found that.. uh.. he found that if..</i>

138
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:30,246
<i>it flowed better without this
particular moment in.. in the film.</i>

139
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:11,313
<i>This is a uh.. a scene that um..</i>

140
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,373
<i>it's a curiosity moment uh..</i>

141
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,329
<i>more than a moment that really
belongs in the film, but um..</i>

142
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,947
<i>remember, I wrote at that last
minute, I just felt..</i>

143
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:23,997
<i>you know it might be interesting
to see these two women meet.</i>

144
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,456
<i>Um.. but um..</i>

145
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:30,847
<i>it's uh.. it.. it.. it's
probably not uh..</i>

146
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>it's not really a scene that ultimately
belongs in the film as we.. we shot it..</i>

147
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,319
<i>and then we looked at it and
we said you know, it's um..</i>

148
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,923
<i>it.. it reduces the film somewhat to the
level of conventionality that we uh..</i>

149
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:46,745
<i>we.. we're trying to avoid.
And it's the scene..</i>

150
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:50,425
<i>you know, it's kind of a standard scene
between the wife and the other woman.</i>

151
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,933
<i>and um..</i>

152
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,205
<i>i.. it.. it's a scene..</i>

153
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,967
<i>we almost expect to see and that's
probably the reason why we.. we left
it out of the film.</i>

154
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,202
<i>It.. it's um..</i>

155
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,823
<i>it almost reduced Joanna's..</i>

156
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,367
<i>level of mystery to making
her more of a kind of uh..</i>

157
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:13,067
<i>conventional, domesticated..</i>

158
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,636
<i>a woman.
And um..</i>

159
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:20,418
<i>you know, it's a scene where she
really wanted to explore..</i>

160
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,292
<i>his world to see where he lived
and how he lived..</i>

161
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,347
<i>and um..</i>

162
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,096
<i>when you look at the scene, you also..</i>

163
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,181
<i>lose a certain uh.. um... empathy
for Joanna, because you're really..</i>

164
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,830
<i>really siding with Amy in this scene,
because she is uh..</i>

165
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:50,463
<i>she is the uh.. the wife who lost the
husband to this.. to this other woman.</i>

166
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:52,283
<i>And uh..</i>

167
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,763
<i>It's uh.. it's not a scene
that's particularly um..</i>

168
00:13:57,032 --> 00:14:00,029
<i>uh.. uh.. dramatically strong for uh..</i>

169
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,146
<i>for the character of Joanna.</i>

170
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:13,014
<i>I'm not sure I ever believed
that moment where she says,</i>

171
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:16,718
<i>"I imagined I have a house like that".
I'm not sure that character..</i>

172
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:20,924
<i>really ever did. She may have imagined it,
because her whole life was imagination.</i>

173
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,508
<i>But uh.. I'm not sure she ever
really wanted it.</i>

174
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,481
<i>But um..</i>

175
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,795
<i>if you just believed that she did,
then..</i>

176
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:35,467
<i>there's a sense of..
of poignancy and uh..</i>

177
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:40,149
<i>sadness when she looks at the house
and sees Amy go into the house and uh..</i>

178
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,064
<i>she wonders..</i>

179
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,898
<i>if she uh.. she's even..</i>

180
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,216
<i>capable of living that life.</i>

181
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:50,276
<i>Or whether she even really
wants to at that moment.</i>

182
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,151
<i>This is a scene we lost because it um..</i>

183
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:26,981
<i>it uh.. really interrupted
the flow of the film.</i>

184
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,308
<i>It became uh.. a father son scene again.</i>

185
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,361
<i>Uh.. something a little too conventional
perhaps for this film.</i>

186
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,782
<i>And uh.. I know Ken..</i>

187
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:41,014
<i>really resisted anything that
tended toward the.. the um..</i>

188
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:45,487
<i>middle-class, uh middlebrow
domesticated drama.</i>

189
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:50,163
<i>And I think he felt the uh.. the idea of
a scene between Grady and his son..</i>

190
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,792
<i>at this point of the movie, um..</i>

191
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,782
<i>might be a little too um..</i>

192
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:04,485
<i>I don't want to say corny, but it might
be a little uh.. uh.. too um..</i>

193
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,244
<i>um.. saccharine, let's say.</i>

194
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:11,604
<i>And um.. I think he really
wanted to avoid that.</i>

195
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,532
<i>I think it's a scene that does, you
know, uh.. give some humanity to Grady..</i>

196
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:19,328
<i>and I think um..</i>

197
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:22,816
<i>we understand his.. his conflict, his..</i>

198
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:24,417
<i>uh.. his pain,</i>

199
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:27,366
<i>uh.. his sense of loss, he.. he
is clearly is torn..</i>

200
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:31,933
<i>uh.. about uh.. leaving his family,
he knows he has to. But um..</i>

201
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:37,591
<i>I.. he.. he's certainly uh..
uh.. tortured about it.</i>

202
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,765
<i>This is a scene.. um..</i>

203
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,473
<i>which..</i>

204
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:10,734
<i>I.. I miss the scene, because I think
it's a good scene, but I understand
why we di.. don't have it in the film.</i>

205
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,276
<i>Uh.. the timing of the scene is wrong,
of where it uh.. where it appears..</i>

206
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:19,483
<i>in.. in the film. It does break up
the momentum of the..</i>

207
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,654
<i>of.. of the uh..</i>

208
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,682
<i>the drama. It really cuts
the intensity.</i>

209
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:28,768
<i>Because, it.. uh.. we're going
from uh.. Joanna and Shayne..</i>

210
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:32,815
<i>to a scene of uh..</i>

211
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,891
<i>Hopper and his domain and uh.. Grady..</i>

212
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>simply visiting that particular
domain at the moment.</i>

213
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,026
<i>And uh.. the scene is really
Hopper's scene. And uh..</i>

214
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:48,556
<i>Here we're focusing so intensely
on Joanna and Shayne..</i>

215
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:53,010
<i>and Grady. And when is Grady
going to get there. And uh..</i>

216
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,661
<i>if he's going to get there.
And um..</i>

217
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,832
<i>it just seemed way off the
line dramatically to..</i>

218
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:04,560
<i>then cut to this particular scene,
where Hopper is uh..</i>

219
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:07,169
<i>extolling the virtues of um..</i>

220
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:10,585
<i>his singlehood, being single. And uh..</i>

221
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:17,478
<i>sexual conquest. It's also.. it's a
misogynistic scene.
I don't think it's very uh..</i>

222
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:20,981
<i>appealing for uh.. the Hopper character.</i>

223
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,953
<i>Bruce is terrific in the scene and
inhabits that character..</i>

224
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,435
<i>uh.. quite effectively. But um..</i>

225
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:32,693
<i>it's uh.. it.. it's not a.. uh..
particularly um..</i>

226
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,316
<i>uh.. positive uh.. um..</i>

227
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:40,212
<i>view or attitude toward women and I
don't think it was necessary to include
in the film. Um..</i>

228
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,411
<i>other than the fact that
it does reveal uh..</i>

229
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,651
<i>this particular world.</i>

230
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,549
<i>And what I was going for was showing
this particular world uh.. and how..</i>

231
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,379
<i>in it.. it's way.. in it's way of sexual
conquest and gamesmanship..</i>

232
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,950
<i>that it's really not all
that different from..</i>

233
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,773
<i>the fantasy world of China Blue
and Shayne. And uh..</i>

234
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:05,672
<i>Their uh..rule of games and.. and
conquest and.. and al..</i>

235
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:09,319
<i>alter egos and identities and uh..</i>

236
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,285
<i>it's uh..</i>

237
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,805
<i>it's a scene in which the..</i>

238
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,734
<i>psychological dynamics
are valid but the..</i>

239
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,302
<i>uh.. and.. and in terms
of the overall..</i>

240
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:27,882
<i>drama of the film in terms of the um..</i>

241
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,420
<i>the themes of the film, because it does
uh.. and I think effectively uh..</i>

242
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:37,774
<i>compare and contrast the two worlds.
It just doesn't..</i>

243
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:41,875
<i>uh.. occur at the right timing of the
film for it to have any uh..</i>

244
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,010
<i>you know, justification
of being in the film.</i>
