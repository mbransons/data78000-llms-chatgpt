1
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,581
John!

2
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,209
John!

3
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:08,296
John!

4
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,133
John!

5
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:13,968
John!

6
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,768
Are you all right, sir?

7
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,147
Yes, I'm fine.

8
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,716
Is there anything I can
do for you?

9
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,984
Should I call your physician?

10
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,363
No.

11
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,741
Good night, Fred.

12
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,203
Good night, Mr. President.

13
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,095
There he is, Alex Gardner,
when he was 19 years old.

14
00:02:57,303 --> 00:03:00,390
I worked with him
for a year and a half.

15
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,475
He was an authentic genius,
this boy.

16
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,019
Exceptionally gifted.

17
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:08,148
Telekinesis was only one
of his talents.

18
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,404
I remember reading about him.

19
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,532
Caused quite a controversy
at the time.

20
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,617
Then, in the middle of it,
he disappeared.

21
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,121
Yeah, he ran out on us.

22
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,749
After months of intensive
parapsychological testing.

23
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,086
Didn't like being
poked and prodded.

24
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,421
Who does?

25
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,340
He's perfect. I want him.

26
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,093
Yes, you're right, of course.
He would be perfect.

27
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,636
If we can find him.

28
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,222
You leave that to me.

29
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,434
If he's alive, I'll find him.

30
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,353
<i>And they're off.</i>

31
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:50,231
<i>Brightly Blue takes the lead,
Admiral's Runner is second,</i>

32
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,526
<i>then Completely Fine third,
followed by Cover the Bet,</i>

33
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,196
<i>Heavy Rains
and High Compression.</i>

34
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,073
<i>Around the turn and breaking
away down the back stretch.</i>

35
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,202
<i>Brightly Blue in front by
a neck, Completely Fine second,</i>

36
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,454
<i>followed by
Admiral's Runner third.</i>

37
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,789
<i>Then it's Heavy Rains,
then High Compression,</i>

38
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,292
<i>begins to move up
making the turn for home.</i>

39
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,294
<i>Here comes High Compression.</i>

40
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,713
<i>It's High Compression
now pulling away.</i>

41
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,548
<i>High Compression at the wire.</i>

42
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:21,012
<i>And in a stunning upset,
the winner is High Compression.</i>

43
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,600
I like Benjamin Franklin.

44
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,770
He discovered electricity,
you know.

45
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,461
Get him!

46
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,764
Damn!

47
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,770
What the hell
are you doing in here?

48
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,648
Are you some kind of pervert
or something?

49
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,567
It's not safe in the damn
toilet anymore.

50
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:18,111
Come on, sweet.

51
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,660
- Hello, Alex.
- Hi. Looking for me?

52
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,892
You know, you could
really hurt a guy's feelings

53
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,756
the way you've been trying
to avoid me and all.

54
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,105
We don't see you
around the track that often,

55
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,129
when we do,

56
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,424
you're always calling them
right on the nose.

57
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,634
So I'm lucky.

58
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,845
Not today, pal.

59
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,543
I can see we're going to have
to teach you a little lesson

60
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,725
about sharing the wealth.

61
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:53,521
If you want to stay healthy, you
and me are going to be partners.

62
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,399
All right. Look.
Look, want this?

63
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,858
It's no problem.

64
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,402
Shit!
Get the son of a bitch!

65
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,175
Hi.

66
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,682
Nice ride!

67
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,902
- Watch where you going!
- Ah, piss off!

68
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,992
Shit!

69
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,203
See you later, partner.

70
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,622
<i>Thank you very much
for joining us this afternoon.</i>

71
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,458
<i>Hope you've had
an exciting day at the track.</i>

72
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,255
<i>Hi, Alex, it's Nancy.
We met at the China Club.</i>

73
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,342
<i>Do you remember?
Call me.</i>

74
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,222
<i>Alex, it's Eddie.</i>

75
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,850
<i>I've gotta get your bets down
for the weekend. Call me, huh?</i>

76
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,240
<i>Alex, this is Maggie.</i>

77
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,534
<i>I don't want to see you,
I don't want to talk to you.</i>

78
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,994
<i>We're through.</i>

79
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:38,000
<i>Alex, it's Maggie.
Call me.</i>

80
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:53,683
Mr. Gardner?

81
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,685
Oh, no, wrong guy.
Gardner lives...

82
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,187
We know you are Alex Gardner.

83
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,149
Who the hell are you?

84
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,692
We're from Thornhill College.

85
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,944
I'm Roy Babcock.
This is Gary Finch.

86
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,676
We have a little
proposition for you.

87
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:07,863
Yeah?

88
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:13,286
- A chance of a lifetime, right?
- Good. Depends on you.

89
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,037
Oh, yeah.
Well, come on,

90
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:17,790
I think we'd better move
in the car, okay?

91
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,858
Hey, listen, guys,
I've thought this over,

92
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,266
and I'm not really interested.

93
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,029
Why don't you just let me off
at La Cienega, okay?

94
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:52,241
I know this is going to sound
a bit sinister, Mr. Gardner,

95
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,994
but we have instructions
to bring you back with us.

96
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,122
You mean I'm being kidnapped?

97
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,893
Well, there are some people up
at Thornhill that are anxious

98
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,376
to meet with you.

99
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,646
Yeah, well, what would you do
if I just opened the door

100
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,172
and jumped, huh?

101
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,674
I guess I'd have to stop you.

102
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,179
Just sit back
and enjoy the ride.

103
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:17,725
- Hey, answer me something.
- If I can.

104
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:22,480
- Am I in any danger?
- Not from us.

105
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,856
Oh, I get it. My mother
put you up to this, right?

106
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,693
I've got to
finish college or else.

107
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,952
Sign in, please.

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,138
Wait a minute, now.
I'm not signing anything, here.

109
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,956
I don't even know
what this is all about.

110
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,042
- Well, we can let this go.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,794
Go ahead.

112
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,648
Just have a seat.
Someone will be with you.

113
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,935
I get the feeling
he knows we're here.

114
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:30,774
Hello, Alex.

115
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,943
I am Dr. Jane DeVries.
We're glad you could come.

116
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,404
Ah, perhaps you can tell me
what the hell I'm doing here.

117
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,253
We wanted to talk to you
about the project

118
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,366
that we're working on.

119
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,993
Yeah? Do you have a think tank
full of geniuses

120
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,828
who want to try out
a new theory?

121
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,038
No.

122
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,246
Well, look, I'm sorry,

123
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,084
but I hung up the psychic bit
when I was 19.

124
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,020
Well, that's fine,
because we're not interested

125
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,420
in parlor tricks here.

126
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,923
What are you interested in?

127
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,633
Dreams.

128
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,885
Dreams?

129
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,514
Why the watch dog?
You got something to hide?

130
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,473
We're a little cautious.

131
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,562
We want to keep things
to ourselves for a while.

132
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,394
Oh. Shh...

133
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,856
This is our
sleep-monitoring station.

134
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,608
- Hi, guys.
- Hello, Doctor DeVries.

135
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,360
These individuals
are under observation

136
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,696
because of the frequency
of their nightmares.

137
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,031
This man is in REM state.

138
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,200
- Rapid...
- Eye Movement.

139
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,160
When dreams occur.

140
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,495
Right.

141
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,331
I mean, I know one
or two things, Doctor DeVries.

142
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,376
I have some more things
to show you.

143
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,090
So, what goes on
in this section?

144
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,925
Well, one of our
areas of research

145
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,260
is sexual dysfunction.

146
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,054
If a man is experiencing
impotency, we can determine

147
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,515
whether the cause is physical
or psychological

148
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,016
by monitoring his sleep.

149
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,185
Mm-hmm? How's that?

150
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,478
Well, if it isn't physical,

151
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,981
he'll experience
three or four erections

152
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,482
during the course of the night.

153
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:54,859
I see.

154
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,612
So, Jane, what you do here,
in effect, is count boners.

155
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,076
I can see you're going to be
a real challenge to work with.

156
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,453
Oh, wait a minute, Doctor.

157
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,705
I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

158
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,641
Doctor DeVries,
may I speak to you right away?

159
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,042
All right.
I'll just be a moment.

160
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,308
Hello, Alex.
You're a bit late.

161
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,770
Novotny, I should have known.

162
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,481
You're nine years too late.

163
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,775
You left me sitting in Chicago

164
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:21,362
with an overheated
bio-feedback machine.

165
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,738
I got tied up.

166
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,107
Well, I didn't mind too much
that you walked out on me,

167
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,409
you could have at least let me
know you were alive.

168
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,911
I was worried.

169
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,622
About me
or your research grant?

170
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,625
Both.

171
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,168
I would apologize, but...

172
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,546
we both know I'm not
very good at that.

173
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,464
That's okay.
It's a long time ago.

174
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:41,465
It's good to see you.

175
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,801
It's good to see you, too.

176
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,487
Do you think next time you could
spare me

177
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,511
the cloak-and-dagger act?

178
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,515
Oh, you mean you would have
come if I just called?

179
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,600
No.

180
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,311
Nice place you got here.

181
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,147
Who's your decorator,
Darth Vader?

182
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,733
Come on,
we need to talk, Alex.

183
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,485
How about some dinner in the
Village?

184
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,694
A couple of drinks, okay?

185
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:03,862
All right.

186
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:08,325
But before you spring for the
check, I just want you to know,

187
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,262
I have no intention of spending
the next six months

188
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,454
with electrodes
wired to my ass.

189
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,790
Don't worry, Alex.

190
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,893
I can always have you
dropped back into your life

191
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,295
of playing the horses
and hustling the women.

192
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,505
I wouldn't dream of standing in
the way

193
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,465
of anything that important.

194
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,426
You sound
as if you don't approve.

195
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,429
You're damn right,
I don't.

196
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,723
You've got
tremendous gifts, Alex,

197
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,059
and you've chosen
to piss them away.

198
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,645
Anything else?

199
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,522
No. That's it.

200
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,733
Come on.
Let's eat.

201
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,288
Anything else?

202
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,469
- Let's play a little game.
- All right, it's your party.

203
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:15,184
Let's pretend that a man,
with a little help from science,

204
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,228
could psychically
project himself

205
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,690
inside the dream
of a sleeping person.

206
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,901
Okay, let's pretend that.

207
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,990
Then, pretend
that once inside the dream,

208
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,786
he could become an active
participant in it. Hmm?

209
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,623
You could actually be there,
right in the middle.

210
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,961
You could feel the dream,
experience it.

211
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,966
Even shape and alter
the dream itself. Hmm?

212
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,343
What would you say
to a notion like that?

213
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,930
That it's crazy.

214
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,726
You see, we've done it, Alex.

215
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,521
Not once, but three times.

216
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,357
Using two men with abilities
in telepathy,

217
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,025
just similar to your own.

218
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,611
Going into
another person's dream?

219
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,155
I might have to see that
to believe it.

220
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,991
Not very much to see.

221
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,161
Just two men with their heads
wired up to a machine.

222
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,623
Because the real trick
takes place up here.

223
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,834
That piece of science fiction
hardware you got,

224
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,043
that's the hook up, right?

225
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,712
That's right.

226
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,798
But all the machine does is
help connect your brainwaves

227
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,425
with the dreamer's.

228
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,344
But, hopefully, once you
get proficient at dreamlink,

229
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,889
you won't even need the machine.

230
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,183
Why me?

231
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,392
Why you?

232
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,271
Because you have a head start
on the rest of us mortals.

233
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,441
You can already work your way
into the conscious mind.

234
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,528
When the conditions are right,
maybe with a little help,

235
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,156
you could also get inside
the subconscious mind.

236
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,867
To the dreamscape!

237
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,202
You got two guys
that have already done this?

238
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,079
You'll meet them.

239
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:04,501
Look, Alex, you don't have
to decide right this minute.

240
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,338
Spend the night here.
Sleep on it.

241
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,383
Give us a chance.

242
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,571
Buddy's vital signs
are increasing.

243
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,740
Is it serious?

244
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,992
They're escalating.

245
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,287
He seems to have a tough time,
poor kid.

246
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,832
And Simms, how is he doing?

247
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,335
Beginning to show signs
of extreme agitation.

248
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,465
- What's his blood pressure?
- 200 over 174 and rising.

249
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,050
Pulse?

250
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,095
145 and rising...
147 now.

251
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,139
Brainwaves?

252
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,392
Erratic.
Let's pull them out.

253
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,519
No, not yet.
Let's see what he does.

254
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,019
How is the boy?

255
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,772
Pulse rate
extremely rapid.

256
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,315
It's rising fast.

257
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,654
- EEG?
- Erratic.

258
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,158
Something's wrong.
I'm bringing him out.

259
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,502
Buddy, wake up!
Buddy! Buddy!

260
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,753
Buddy!

261
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,964
It's okay. It's okay.

262
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,178
What's going on
inside that kid's head?

263
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,805
What in God's name
is he so frightened of?

264
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,647
Rise and shine!

265
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,608
Morning!

266
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:33,816
What time is it?

267
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,360
It's early.

268
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,654
How did you sleep?

269
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,323
Have any dreams?

270
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,077
Do you mind if I take a leak
before I give my deposition?

271
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,246
No. Sorry.

272
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,455
Force of habit.

273
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,916
Mm-hmm.

274
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,293
Do you want to explain
last night to me?

275
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,003
You saw one of our psychics,

276
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,714
Edward Simms, dreamlinking
with a young boy

277
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,926
who has been suffering
from chronic nightmares.

278
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,763
And I don't know what demons
that boy has inside,

279
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:07,267
but... they were certainly
too much for Edward now.

280
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,019
I think I'd have to be
out of my mind

281
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,939
to hook up with that machine
of yours.

282
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,693
I think you'd be out
of your mind not to.

283
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,695
Well, okay, there are risks,

284
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,614
but I think
they're controllable.

285
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,992
What's the point of it?

286
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,744
Look, I'm going to level
with you.

287
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,622
I'm doing this because no one
has ever done it before.

288
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,334
No one has even conceived
of doing it before.

289
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,296
The simple fact is I'm doing it
because it's exciting.

290
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,259
I got to admit,
it sounds tempting.

291
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,846
But I don't think I can get back
on that merry-go-round with you.

292
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,557
Well, I...

293
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,559
I tried.

294
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,939
I think you could really
have helped this project, Alex.

295
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,192
Too bad.

296
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,862
And I'm awfully sorry
about this IRS business, too.

297
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,239
What?

298
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,284
Oh, maybe
I didn't mention it to you.

299
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,120
But, you see,
while we were searching for you,

300
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,205
our government sources
took quite an interest

301
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,456
in your gambling winnings,

302
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:15,043
and I think the IRS is figuring
on about a 5-year audit.

303
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,337
What?

304
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,091
What?

305
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,885
If you could see your way clear
to join this program,

306
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,806
I might be able to do something
about it.

307
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,558
Novotny, you dirty
son of a bitch,

308
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,744
there's no way you're going
to blackmail me into this.

309
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,020
You understand that?

310
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,372
I'm never going to do
this for you.

311
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,480
Not this way. No way!

312
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,190
You understand?
Never!

313
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,610
Green.

314
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,114
Uh, green.

315
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,201
Blue.

316
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,663
Blue.

317
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,209
Yellow.

318
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:00,755
Ah...

319
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,049
Red.

320
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,800
You're not concentrating.

321
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,970
What's the point of this?
I've done it a million times.

322
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,265
You've got to sharpen
your psychic abilities.

323
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,354
You'll have to learn
to reach a meditative state

324
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,687
in which your mind
can conform with the dreamer's.

325
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,942
Green.

326
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,738
Yellow.

327
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,240
Yes.

328
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,449
Yes?

329
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,869
Yes. I find you attractive.

330
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,623
That's just what you were
wondering, right?

331
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:35,582
That's what you were thinking.

332
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,376
Knock it off, Alex.

333
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,293
I'm not going to have you

334
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,295
start trying to play
mind-reader with me.

335
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,257
Well, how else do you expect me
to warm up the old whammy, huh?

336
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,427
Why can't you take this
more seriously?

337
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:48,636
For once in your life,

338
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,889
try to use your gift
for something positive.

339
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,517
Yeah, right.
The old God-given gift, huh?

340
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,477
Everybody deserves
a piece of it.

341
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,563
Okay, Doctor Deep Freeze.

342
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,649
Let's get on with it.

343
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,191
You play music with this thing?

344
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,277
That's a matter of opinion.

345
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,611
Who the hell are you?

346
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,655
Tommy Ray Glatman.

347
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:54,161
Oh, yeah.
Paul told me about you.

348
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,705
You're the Neil Armstrong
of dreamlinking, right?

349
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:57,913
Right.

350
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,749
Just like walking on the moon.

351
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,293
Yeah?

352
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,463
Careful in that?
Fit okay?

353
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,175
You bet I can score heavy
in a coat like this, huh?

354
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,177
Yeah, I bet.

355
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,596
Listen, I want to put on
some clothes.

356
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,073
Want to go out
and have a couple of beers?

357
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,599
Why?

358
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,034
I don't know,
I just thought maybe...

359
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,643
I know what you want.

360
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,980
I knew it the second I saw you.

361
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,732
You want my secrets.

362
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,484
No, I don't.

363
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,776
I just want some advice.

364
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,403
I don't give advice.

365
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm in this with me, myself,
and I. That's it.

366
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,951
Sorry.

367
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,204
Novotny gives me free reign.
You know why?

368
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,165
Must be your
sparkling personality.

369
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,043
'Cause I'm the only guy, Alex.

370
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,754
I'm the only guy
who can do it.

371
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,006
What about Edward Simms?

372
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,134
They had to carry him away
in a basket.

373
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,888
Now, well, Novotny seems
to think I'll be able to do it.

374
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,394
I'll order your basket.

375
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,502
He's ready, Doctor.

376
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,797
- Alex?
- Hmm?

377
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,633
Just remember
that the first time out,

378
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,344
all we want you to do
is make contact,

379
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,805
so once you get
inside his dream,

380
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:40,183
you're an observer,
not a participant, okay?

381
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,561
Sort of a cerebral
Peeping Tom?

382
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,853
That's right.

383
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,816
Bill Hardy has been a good
test subject for us before.

384
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,859
Oh, he's a steelworker.

385
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,237
I'll probably wind up
in some bad beer commercial.

386
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,156
You'll be fine.

387
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,701
Paul...

388
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,136
Once you get me in
to this thing,

389
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,497
just make damn sure you can get
my ass back out.

390
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,083
We'll get you out.

391
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,841
Hardy should be entering
REM stage shortly, Alex.

392
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,181
You can begin
your deep breathing now.

393
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,865
Hardy has entered REM now.

394
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,575
How is Alex?

395
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,077
Emitting a good regular
alpha wave pattern.

396
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,580
He's ready.

397
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,834
Stand by.

398
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,545
<i>Project.</i>

399
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,170
Hey! Hey, look!

400
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,006
Look out! Look!

401
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,552
Help me!

402
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,306
Help!

403
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,101
Hold on!

404
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,604
Give me your hand!

405
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,942
I'm slipping!

406
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,782
I can't hold on!

407
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,872
Help me!

408
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,209
Hold on!

409
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,258
Don't let me go!

410
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,850
Don't...

411
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,403
Easy now, Alex. Easy.

412
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,739
- Paul!
- Welcome back.

413
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,949
It was incredible!

414
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:43,950
Wait, wait, wait.

415
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,661
Get this shit off of me.
It was so damn real.

416
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:49,873
- Real?
- Yeah.

417
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,791
You remember anything?

418
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,127
- Yeah, we were on a skyscraper.
- Uh-huh?

419
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,713
Alex and me.
A girder broke away.

420
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,131
I was there!

421
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,339
I was there!

422
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,471
I want a CAT-scan
and an EEG on Alex

423
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,698
first thing in the morning.

424
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:06,722
Okay?

425
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,529
Hello, Alex.

426
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,656
Hello.

427
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,911
I'm Bob Blair.

428
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,413
I thought it was about time
we met.

429
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,916
What do you have to do
with all this?

430
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,709
Oh, I just run it.

431
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,586
For the government.

432
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,549
Hold it. Novotny never said
this was a government project.

433
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,469
Novotny was absolutely right
not to.

434
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:49,599
We don't particularly want our
involvement in this advertised.

435
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,768
Well, excuse me
for not shaking hands.

436
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,056
Hey, I'm through here.
Would you mind unstrapping me?

437
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,272
I'm afraid
I can't help you there.

438
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,858
You better wait. A nurse
will come along in a minute.

439
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,110
Alex...

440
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:07,242
I just wanted to extend
my congratulations to you.

441
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,702
They told me
about your successful dreamlink.

442
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:10,954
Well done.

443
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,205
Thanks.

444
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,833
This is only the beginning,
you know.

445
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,836
We all feel that the
possibilities for our program

446
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,922
are tremendously exciting.

447
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,966
But we've got to see
that you don't jeopardize

448
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,717
the wonderful work
you've already done.

449
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,928
I don't follow you, Bob.

450
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,930
Well, you have been playing it

451
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,724
a little fast and loose
since you got here.

452
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:35,228
Those unauthorized visits to
the dream chamber, for instance,

453
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,436
that's a bit sneaky.

454
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,149
Now, I'm afraid
that's got to stop.

455
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,944
Your work here
is completely confidential.

456
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,612
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

457
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,489
knowing that you
understand that.

458
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,230
I'd feel a lot more comfortable

459
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,323
if you could find someone
to get me out of this rig.

460
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,806
You wait right there.
I'll get you a nurse.

461
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,830
Yeah.

462
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,583
And, uh...

463
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,918
Thanks.

464
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:08,386
Hi!

465
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,472
How are you doing?

466
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,765
Good.

467
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,392
Oh...

468
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,479
Is it the kid I saw linking
with Edward Simms?

469
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,399
Yes.
His name is Buddy Driscoll.

470
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,068
What's his story?

471
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,778
Take a look at these.

472
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,530
He's tormented
by recurring nightmares.

473
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,241
The little guy is terrified
of going to sleep.

474
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,090
He's on the verge
of a complete breakdown.

475
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,963
There's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

476
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,459
You mind if I talk to him?

477
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,670
Oh, I wish you would.

478
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,380
All right.

479
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,091
Buddy, I'd like for you to meet

480
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,302
a good friend of mine,
Alex Gardner.

481
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,429
Hey, Buddy.

482
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,933
Are you a doctor, Alex?

483
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,809
Who, me?

484
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,355
No, no, I'm not a doctor.
I'm just staying here, like you.

485
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:02,774
How are you doing?

486
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,108
Not so good.

487
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,986
There's somebody
in my dreams.

488
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:08,738
Oh, yeah?

489
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:09,988
Who?

490
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,742
An awful ugly monster.

491
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,661
Yeah, a monster, huh?

492
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,414
I'd punch his lights out,
but he's too big.

493
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,375
You'd punch his lights out, huh?

494
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,001
Sure, I would.

495
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,420
Keeps making me miss
Little League.

496
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:25,755
Yeah?
Well, you know

497
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,216
when I was a kid,
about your age, still a kid,

498
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:31,344
but I mean, I used to have
bad dreams.

499
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,887
- You did?
- Yeah.

500
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,936
Yeah, I found that
if I could talk to somebody,

501
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,225
it made me feel
a whole lot better.

502
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,661
So, that's what I
want to tell you,

503
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,646
is that if you ever want to talk
to somebody, talk to me.

504
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,233
Okay, Alex.

505
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,360
What do you say,
we get you back?

506
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,778
I'll come with you.

507
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,072
Let's turn this train
around, here.

508
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,773
<i>Why?</i>

509
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,943
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

510
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,320
<i>It burns.</i>

511
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:41,706
<i>What did we do?</i>

512
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:46,002
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

513
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:05,521
Oh! Oh!

514
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,774
- Dad! Dad!
- It's my fault!

515
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,443
Dad, it's all right.
It was just a dream.

516
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:13,488
I can't stand this.
It gets worse every night.

517
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,490
Ever since mother died...

518
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,387
Watch your step, sir.

519
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,854
Welcome to the western
White House, Mr. Blair.

520
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:47,855
How is he, Fred?

521
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,482
As well as can be expected.

522
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,859
I know he'll be glad to see you.

523
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:56,322
Bob!

524
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,908
Thanks for coming.

525
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,868
It's been a long time,
Mr. President.

526
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,580
Yeah. Fred, give us
a moment alone, huh?

527
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,125
Sit down.

528
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,918
Relax.

529
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,088
Ah, damn!

530
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,506
It's good to see you.

531
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:17,260
Well, we've been through a lot
together, haven't we, you and I?

532
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,262
Fought quite a few battles.

533
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,809
Let's talk about
those nightmares.

534
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,813
They're getting
progressively worse.

535
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,691
It's terrifying.
I haven't slept in weeks.

536
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,861
And your doctor?

537
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,612
Oh, they're useless.

538
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:40,116
It's beginning to affect my job.

539
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,828
That's the real reason
you're here, isn't it?

540
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,498
I'm... I'm here because
I'm your friend.

541
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:54,463
One of the projects
I've been overseeing

542
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:59,802
concerns the foremost
specialists in dream research.

543
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,471
I think they may very well
be able to help.

544
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,933
I'll be honest with you...

545
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,562
I think there's a reason
for these dreams.

546
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,564
What do you mean?

547
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:16,903
It's my responsibility to bring
the world back from the brink.

548
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,364
This nuclear madness
has to end.

549
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:23,451
I've decided to lead personally

550
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,746
the delegation
to Geneva next month.

551
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:31,918
John...
You can't be serious.

552
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:35,171
No, no, no. I know
you're against me on this.

553
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,005
But I'm going to make

554
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:39,550
a disarmament deal
with the Russians.

555
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,096
One thing at a time.

556
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,975
Our first priority
is your peace of mind.

557
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:51,896
Peace of mind! Who the hell
ever has peace of mind?

558
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:55,149
I just want
the damned nightmares to end.

559
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,526
That's what we all want.

560
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:02,323
If you'll allow me...
I think I can help.

561
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,660
How often does this occur,
Mrs. Webber?

562
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,663
About twice a week.

563
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,271
I wake up in the
middle of the night

564
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,124
to find George gone
from our bed.

565
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,252
And every time I find him
in the same place.

566
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,171
On the front lawn,
in his pajamas...

567
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,632
calling my name.

568
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,551
When she...
When Melanie wakes me up,

569
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,430
for the life of me, I can't
remember what I was dreaming.

570
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,892
All I know is I have this
terrible feeling of anxiety.

571
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:31,161
The neighbors are
starting to think

572
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,478
that George is a little crazy.

573
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,314
Have you been under
any unusual pressure?

574
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:39,193
No. Not really.

575
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,778
What about at home?

576
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,947
How are you two getting along?

577
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,740
Well...

578
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,492
If you're referring
to our sex life,

579
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,541
George has been having
a little problem lately.

580
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,914
But... I feel certain
that's just a passing thing.

581
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,749
Isn't that right, honey?

582
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,419
Oh, yes, sure.
Absolutely.

583
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,755
I'm just a little drug down,
that's all.

584
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:01,757
Is there any pressure at work?

585
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:05,219
Well, whatever Webber's dreaming
is the key to all his problems.

586
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:06,828
I'd say whoever
sold him that toupée

587
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,264
is the key to all his problems.

588
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,992
...they gave
the position to another...

589
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,393
If you could go in, Alex,
and observe his dream.

590
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:13,601
That would be your first

591
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,980
practical
application of dreamlink.

592
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,857
When do I go in?

593
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,692
How does tomorrow night sound?

594
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,485
Fine.

595
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,953
EEG, stable.

596
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,621
Alex is ready.

597
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,498
Webber?

598
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,338
He's in REM sleep.

599
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,922
Good.

600
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,842
Alex, stand by.

601
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,788
Ever been married?

602
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:16,539
No.

603
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,417
Well, it's no picnic,
let me tell you.

604
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:21,045
You have to keep your eye
on them every minute.

605
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,558
My house is the next one down.

606
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,395
I don't want to give her any
warning, know what I mean?

607
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,230
Now, here's the plan of attack.

608
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,718
You go in through the back door,

609
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,108
and I'll go in
through the front.

610
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,068
And, remember, no prisoners.

611
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,569
Right.

612
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:48,280
You scared, kid?

613
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,657
No.

614
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,367
Well, let's go.

615
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,411
Hurry! Hurry!

616
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:54,995
Go ahead!

617
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,267
Come on!

618
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,324
Oh, my God!

619
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,910
George!

620
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,580
And with my own brother?

621
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:39,164
Hi, George.

622
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,584
And in front of the children?

623
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,115
I see you under there!
Come on out!

624
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:51,719
Phil! Dave! Herbie!
Some golf buddies you are!

625
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,348
Good God!

626
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,559
Aw, knock that off.
I'm Jewish.

627
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,895
So sorry, Mr. Webber.

628
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:04,398
You, too, Fukuda?

629
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,401
What do you think?

630
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,653
It's very simple.

631
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,322
Mr. Webber has been repressing

632
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,324
a deep-seated
inferiority complex,

633
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:17,369
complicated by feelings
of sexual inadequacy.

634
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:18,329
In other words...

635
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,915
He's worried
about who's shtooping his wife.

636
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,962
Well, at least, now we know
what we're dealing with.

637
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,566
Well, look, now that you've shed
some light on Webber's case,

638
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,759
maybe you can help me
with one of my problems.

639
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,594
Oh, sure.
What's that?

640
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,263
Buddy Driscoll,
the kid with the nightmares.

641
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:37,890
Yes?

642
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,433
I want to go in.

643
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,895
That's impossible.

644
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,981
I've already lost one psychic
over this, Alex.

645
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,609
I don't understand this.

646
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,403
This kid is being eaten alive,
and nobody gives a damn.

647
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,781
Oh, listen,
that's totally outrageous.

648
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,759
I'm sick that we haven't been
able to help him.

649
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,867
Well, then, let me go in.

650
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,452
I mean, look,
if our research here

651
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,381
isn't designed to help a kid
like Buddy out,

652
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:01,956
then what the hell
are we doing, huh?

653
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,084
I will not destroy this program
by going too fast.

654
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,085
You see?

655
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:09,380
I either go in with Buddy
or I'm out of the project.

656
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:11,966
Then, you're out.

657
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,927
I'm not kidding
around here, Paul.

658
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:18,264
Either I go in
or I'm walking.

659
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,560
I know I can help this kid.

660
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:26,981
You're a bastard,
you know that, Alex.

661
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:29,149
I'm doing this
against my better judgement.

662
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,318
Thanks.

663
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,947
Don't thank me.
This isn't my idea.

664
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,743
- Drink?
- Sure.

665
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:42,037
I don't have to tell you...

666
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,039
could be in for a rough ride.

667
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:45,499
I know that.

668
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,501
Just tell me what I can do
to help.

669
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:57,303
There is a tribe in Malaysia
called the Senoi.

670
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,805
The dream people.

671
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,516
They believe their dream lives

672
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:06,061
are just as real
as their waking lives.

673
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:10,232
The children are taught to never
lose control in a nightmare.

674
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:14,695
They've got to face their fears
and conquer them.

675
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:18,073
And I think that's what you
have to do to help Buddy, Alex.

676
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:24,496
Whatever his demon is,
you have to help him face it.

677
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:41,513
Okay, Buddy, you're all set.

678
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,350
- Can I talk to him?
- Sure.

679
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:47,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

680
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,104
Feel sleepy yet?

681
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,439
I guess.

682
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:52,441
- But...
- But what?

683
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,485
But I'll have to dream, Alex.

684
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:55,736
Yeah.

685
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,321
You want to know a secret?

686
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,115
I'm going to be there.

687
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:01,699
You are?

688
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,827
Yeah. I really am.

689
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,245
Okay.

690
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:06,705
If you're going to be there...

691
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:08,582
Got something else for you, too.

692
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,335
Thanks, Alex.

693
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,002
Eh...

694
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,484
Alex, stand by.

695
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,195
And project.

696
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:08,975
Buddy.

697
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:11,061
Buddy, what are you doing?

698
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,439
Are you the babysitter, Alex?

699
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:15,733
I...
Yeah, I'm the babysitter.

700
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:18,360
'Cause most of the time
they just leave me here.

701
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,571
You don't have to be afraid.

702
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:21,947
You know the Snakeman?

703
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:23,157
The who?

704
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:24,616
The Snakeman.

705
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:27,286
Snakeman? What do you mean,
like the Boogeyman?

706
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,663
He's outside, and he wants
to come in and get me.

707
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:30,997
The Snakeman!

708
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,541
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

709
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,585
I'm not going to let him
get 'ya.

710
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,297
Just let me see who it is,
all right?

711
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:41,592
Please don't answer it!

712
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,427
It's probably not even him.

713
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:04,031
You see?
There's nobody there.

714
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,407
Are you sure, Alex?

715
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:06,616
He's always there.

716
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:08,493
Alex!

717
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,249
That's my dad.

718
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:17,377
But he won't help us.

719
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:19,046
Little bastard's right.

720
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,240
Come on! Come on!

721
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:25,737
Stop it! Stop it!

722
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,829
You can do it!
Kill him!

723
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,584
Kill him! Kill him, Buddy!

724
00:48:42,045 --> 00:48:44,715
Yes! Do it again!

725
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,219
Good! The head!

726
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,931
Hit him in the head, Buddy!
Now! Do it now!

727
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,859
He's gone!

728
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,485
He's gone!

729
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,696
We killed him!
We killed him!

730
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:10,490
We sure did, Buddy.
We sure did.

731
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,035
We did it.
He's gone.

732
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,410
You did it, Buddy.

733
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,831
You killed him.

734
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:24,296
<i>Even the Presidency, it seems,
is not exempt from the flu.</i>

735
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,423
<i>The President has retired
for a few days</i>

736
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:29,176
<i>to his California retreat
to recuperate while he prepares</i>

737
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,803
<i>for the Geneva nuclear
disarmament conference.</i>

738
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:34,556
<i>White House Press-Secretary
James Nichols announced today</i>

739
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,141
<i>the President will
personally lead</i>

740
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,435

741

742
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,690
<i>In an 11th-hour-compromise

745
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:49,738
What are you,
a cartoonist?

746
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:52,282
Uh, no. I...

747
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:53,971
I met this thing
in a kid's nightmare,

748
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,314
and it scared the hell
out of me.

749
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:56,495
Yeah, I heard about that.

750
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,998
You got these jerks thinking
you can walk on water.

751
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,367
Probably think that makes you

752
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,086
a pretty important man
around here.

753
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:06,254
Almost as important as me.

754
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,466
Well, don't worry, Tommy.
You're still number-1 lab rat.

755
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:14,012
This thing really
got to you, huh?

756
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,808
You might say that.

757
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,911
Hello, Jane.

758
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:40,080
Hello, Alex.

759
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:42,708
I'm, um...

760
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,293
...going to the Village
for a bite to eat.

761
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:46,712
Interested?

762
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:48,839
No. Thanks.

763
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:52,592
Found a wonderful Italian place,
they make great linguini.

764
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:57,180
Sorry. I've got a pile of
paperwork to get through.

765
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,516
Maybe I'm going about this
all wrong.

766
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,977
I like you, Jane.

767
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,521
I like you, too, Alex.

768
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,148
You do?

769
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:07,356
But there are two reasons

770
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:09,001
why I'm not going to
go to bed with you.

771
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,235
Bed?

772
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:12,070
Bed?
Who said anything about bed?

773
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:13,572
I'm talking about linguini here.

774
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,533
I just thought
I'd save you some time.

775
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,368
Okay.

776
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:21,038
Since we're being so honest,
why not?

777
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:22,831
First of all, I don't
want to join

778
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,160
the ranks of your conquests.

779
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,249
You're not a conquest.

780
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,852
It's not the way
I feel about you, Jane.

781
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,354
Secondly, I don't want
to jeopardize

782
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:29,504
our working relationship.

783
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:33,258
This program has
got to come first.

784
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:35,260
Okay.

785
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,596
Friends?

786
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,514
Friends.

787
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:42,768
You treacherous!

788
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,188
I'll bring you back ravioli.

789
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:47,731
To go.

790
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,321
You work with Paul Novotny?

791
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,406
Paul who?

792
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:58,533
Right. "Paul who?"

793
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,619
Charlie Prince.

794
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:01,870
Well, hello, there.

795
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,748
Could we catch another beer
for the Monsignor here?

796
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:05,999
Thanks.

797
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:09,211
You know something,
you look familiar to me.

798
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,879
Uh...

799
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:14,591
I know I got one of these
damn things in here somewhere.

800
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,179
You write these horror books?

801
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:22,057
- Yeah. I'm the one.
- That's great.

802
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:23,724
What are you doing here?

803
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:25,560
- Research.
- Yeah?

804
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,187
Yeah, I'm working on a new book.

805
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,480
It's got to do with dreams.

806
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,688
Yeah?

807
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,775
Sounds like another winner.

808
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:34,236
Look, I know what's going on
at Bates Hall.

809
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,363
I know all about this
dreamlink business.

810
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:37,697
I know you're part of it.

811
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,324
You know as much as I do,
don't you.

812
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,284
Maybe I know more.

813
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:44,146
Look, you got a point
to make here?

814
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,831
Because I sure wish
you'd make it.

815
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:49,709
I assume you've run into a top,
smooth, corporate-type name,

816
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,378
Bob Blair.

817
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,421
You want to guess what he does?

818
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:55,423
He's with the government.

819
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:57,717
He's more than just
with the government.

820
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,970
He's one of the most powerful
men in it.

821
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:01,972
Head of Covert Intelligence.

822
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,891
Presidents come and go.
Bob Blair remains.

823
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,703
Yeah, well, if he's so powerful,
then, what the hell is he doing

824
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,230
wasting his time
on dream research, huh?

825
00:53:11,148 --> 00:53:13,066
Consider all the deep,
dark secrets

826
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:15,360
that people hide away
in their minds.

827
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:18,113
Now, those secrets are bound
to come out in their dreams, no?

828
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:21,559
It occurs to me that a technique
for plumbing those secrets

829
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,016
could be of enormous interest
to certain intelligence groups.

830
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:27,372
- Good idea for a book, huh?
- Yeah.

831
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:31,334
Still, you know what they say
is stranger than fiction.

832
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,884
Excuse me just a moment.

833
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,580
Jane?

834
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:10,831
Jane, you there?

835
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,768
May I have your ticket, please?

836
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,066
Thank you.

837
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,164
Jane!

838
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,041
Jane!

839
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:42,710
- Wait! Wait!
- Don't touch me!

840
00:57:42,919 --> 00:57:44,087
You had no right to do that.

841
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:45,356
Look, I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.

842
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,172
Maybe I was a little
out of line.

843
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:47,715
- Oh, maybe?
- Look. All right.

844
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:49,968
It just happened.
What can I say?

845
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:52,554
Was it so awful?

846
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:54,198
Well, it depends
on the way you look at it.

847
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:55,241
I mean, it was just a dream,

848
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:56,617
so it didn't
really happen, did it?

849
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:57,910
- No, it didn't.
- So if it didn't really happen,

850
00:57:57,934 --> 00:57:59,286
then I shouldn't be upset,
should I?

851
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,061
But I am upset, damn it.

852
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,938
I can see that. I'm sorry.

853
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:02,939
You know, it would help a lot

854
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,500
if you wouldn't be so
goddamn apologetic

855
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:06,860
and go back to your usual
insensitive self.

856
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:13,741
Alex, what you did was wrong.

857
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:15,637
But it doesn't take
a genius to realize

858
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:16,942
that what happened in the dream

859
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,872
was something that
we both wanted.

860
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,291
What are we going to do
about that?

861
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,960
I don't know.
We forget it.

862
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,379
I can't forget it.

863
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,381
Sorry, Alex.

864
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,382
Hey, Jane?

865
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,176
There's one thing
you overlooked.

866
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:34,304
I entered that dream
without any help or hookup.

867
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:36,890
I did it all on my own.

868
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:42,020
Paul. Tell me.

869
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,564
You work miracles.

870
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,358
Is there a possibility
the President can be helped?

871
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:51,863
A possibility.
No guarantee.

872
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,657
Why are you getting involved
in this?

873
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,869
Because we're the only ones
who can help him now.

874
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,748
The man is falling to pieces,
Paul.

875
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:06,127
He's just sitting there,
in the Oval Office,

876
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:08,421
making decisions
based on his nightmares.

877
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,132
He certainly wouldn't be
the first world leader

878
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:13,343
to take his dreams seriously.

879
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,219
No, but he could be

880
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,471
the first to destroy his country
because of it.

881
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:20,892
Isn't that overstating things
a tiny bit?

882
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,979
Do you realize what he
plans to do? In Geneva?

883
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:27,398
He's going to emasculate
our nuclear deterrent

884
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:29,817
and bring the whole damn country
to its knees.

885
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:35,073
Because of his dreams.

886
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:40,119
Well, I'm not going to allow
that to happen.

887
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,790
Paul...

888
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:51,631
You and I are going to bring
the President here,

889
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,467
and we're going to use
everything that we have

890
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:57,136
in our power to save him.

891
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,101
What is the readout
on Mrs. Matusik?

892
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:07,981
Blood pressure 126 over 84...
EKG normal.

893
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:16,863
Hi.

894
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:18,616
Hi.

895
01:00:18,825 --> 01:00:21,035
Still mad at me?

896
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:22,704
No.
But I've been thinking about...

897
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,372
Doctor DeVries...

898
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:25,621
I was under the impression

899
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:28,001
were were conducting
scientific research here.

900
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:30,253
Excuse me.

901
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:33,006
Pulse rate 95... 97...

902
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,974
Her pulse is starting to rise...
rising fast.

903
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:44,142
Her EKG shows
rapid contractions.

904
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:48,605
Defib!
She's fibrillating!

905
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:53,651
Oh, my God, Paul, she's having
a massive coronary.

906
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:55,194
Impossible!

907
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:58,905
Code Blue!

908
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,990
Code Blue!

909
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:02,201
Get a crash cart in here,
right away!

910
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,124
What the hell's going on?

911
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:11,585
Get the Defib ready!

912
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,338
400 watt-seconds!

913
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:16,049
- Do you want bi-carb?
- Yes, and calcium chloride.

914
01:01:16,257 --> 01:01:18,092
I think we're losing her.

915
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,015
- Straight line!
- Clear! Stand clear!

916
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:26,433
Once more.

917
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,685
Stand clear!

918
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,775
- Is there a pulse?
- Nothing's happening.

919
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:36,319
Let's try once more.

920
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:48,414
Alex, would you mind?

921
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,376
I really got to be alone.

922
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:55,713
I'm still shook up
about Mrs. Matusik.

923
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,719
She must have had a bum ticker.
Fucking shame.

924
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:05,139
You may not know it
to look at me,

925
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:08,643
but I'm a pretty sensitive guy.

926
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,603
It really affected me.

927
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:14,023
It didn't affect your appetite.

928
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:16,484
I eat to forget.

929
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:19,987
Let go.

930
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,282
Let go, or you're going
to draw back a stump.

931
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:25,618
A woman died, Tommy.

932
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:30,123
Everybody dies.

933
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:48,975
Over here.

934
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,518
- Paul.
- Yes?

935
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,413
Could I have a word with you
for a moment, please?

936
01:02:52,437 --> 01:02:54,856
Certainly.

937
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,068
This isn't the way
I wanted it at all.

938
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:01,320
The President will be staying
in the North Wing.

939
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:02,864
But the North Wing
is impractical.

940
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,699
I've got everything I need
right here.

941
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,468
Well, you'll just have to make
other arrangements.

942
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,078
I'm sorry, but this is my area
of expertise, not yours.

943
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:11,487
I have considerations that you
know nothing about, Paul.

944
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:13,374
Just see that it's done.

945
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,834
What considerations?

946
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,419
Security, for one.

947
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,963
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.

948
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,590
If you're concerned
about security,

949
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,384
then, this wing is clearly
the easiest one to isolate.

950
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:26,804
If you can't handle the move,
my people will do it for you.

951
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:28,681
What are you up to, Blair?

952
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:32,852
Paul.

953
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,772
I don't want to get
into a debate over this.

954
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,817
My sole concern is the
well-being of the President.

955
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:42,945
I don't know what you're
concerned with anymore, Blair,

956
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:47,408
but is it really the well-being
of the President?

957
01:03:59,462 --> 01:04:01,756
How's my good right arm?

958
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,050
Climbing the friggin' walls.

959
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:14,644
This place is starting
to close in on me.

960
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,482
You haven't been
taking anything?

961
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,777
I don't touch drugs.

962
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:23,694
Good.

963
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:26,030
I'm messed up enough.

964
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,200
At least, that's what
people tell me.

965
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:33,329
Well, they're wrong, Tommy.

966
01:04:33,538 --> 01:04:35,915
You lacked direction,
that's all.

967
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:40,670
Yeah.

968
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,840
Took a guy like you to
understand me, Bobby boy.

969
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,052
All I did was
channel your talents, son.

970
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:50,555
When are you going to cut me
loose from this dump?

971
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:54,016
You promised
you had big plans for me.

972
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:55,810
I do.

973
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:59,063
That's why I'm here.

974
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,024
Charlie?

975
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,818
Alex...

976
01:06:28,027 --> 01:06:29,528
Sorry about all this
clandestine crap,

977
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:32,239
but, uh, Blair likes to keep
a close watch on things.

978
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:33,950
Yeah, I noticed.

979
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:36,077
I had to let you know
you're in danger.

980
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,870
What's going on here, Charlie?

981
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:39,598
Last week I would have laughed
at you,

982
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,624
I'm not so sure about...
What's going on?

983
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,644
The stakes are a little higher
than I imagined.

984
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:46,045
Mister Blair is
playing for keeps.

985
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:47,481
That woman who linked
with Tommy Ray

986
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:48,881
didn't just die
of a heart attack.

987
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:50,257
What are you saying?

988
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,218
I'm saying Blair's
a ruthless killer.

989
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:55,054
Officially, his organization
doesn't even exist.

990
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:58,182
I mean, these are the guys
even the CIA are afraid of.

991
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:00,285
What, you mean he's training me
to be some kind of a spy?

992
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:02,061
No, no, no,
he wants more than spies, Alex.

993
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,146
He wants assassins.

994
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,358
Charlie.

995
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,621
Come on.

996
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:54,864
Hey! Hey!

997
01:07:59,035 --> 01:08:00,411
Hey!

998
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,246
Charlie!

999
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:03,998
Charlie!

1000
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,374
Charlie!

1001
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:06,042
Charlie!

1002
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,336
No! No!

1003
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:13,299
Charlie!

1004
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:21,932
Hello, Alex.

1005
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:23,726
You son of a bitch,
you killed him.

1006
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,561
Prince was dangerous.
He was an amateur.

1007
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,789
He would have blown the cover
off the whole project.

1008
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:28,939
You murdered him.

1009
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,524
Yes. I did.

1010
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,238
You had Tommy Ray

1011
01:08:37,406 --> 01:08:39,992
kill that woman
in the dreamlink, didn't you?

1012
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:40,951
Yes.

1013
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,620
Why?

1014
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:45,664
I wanted to see if it
could be done.

1015
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:49,752
You're a real humanitarian,
Blair.

1016
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,213
I'm a realist.

1017
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:56,092
We live in a dangerous,
hostile world.

1018
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,845
I will do whatever I have to,
to keep this country safe.

1019
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:03,057
That's what scares me.

1020
01:09:03,516 --> 01:09:06,644
You're a very intelligent
young man, Alex.

1021
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,313
You've mastered
an amazing technique.

1022
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:12,483
Surely, you can see
the possibilities.

1023
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,735
During his dreamlink
with Matusik,

1024
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:17,196
Tommy Ray stabbed her
with a knife.

1025
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,864
A dream knife.

1026
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,868
The shock to Matusik's system
caused a coronary, and she died.

1027
01:09:23,869 --> 01:09:27,081
So, the old wives' tale
comes true, after all.

1028
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:32,253
When you dream that you die,
you die in life...

1029
01:09:32,461 --> 01:09:34,421
the very same instant.

1030
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,175
Now we can go
into an enemy's dream...

1031
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,136
kill him...

1032
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:43,430
make it look
as if he died in his sleep.

1033
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,726
Do you realize what that means?

1034
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:50,729
It means no one's safe from you.

1035
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,585
The question is whether
you're going to cooperate.

1036
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,153
I never had any doubts
about Tommy Ray.

1037
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,201
Well, why should you?
He killed his own father.

1038
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,031
He's a fucking psychopath.

1039
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,161
Alex... It's very simple.

1040
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,205
Either you work for me,
or you die.

1041
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:15,212
Jump!

1042
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:51,832
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

1043
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,584
Good!

1044
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:58,714
Hey, my bike!
That's my bike!

1045
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,886
We lost him.

1046
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:06,013
Yes.

1047
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:10,309
I'm afraid he has to be killed.

1048
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:13,520
He can only hurt us now.

1049
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,369
Welcome to Thornhill,
Mr. President.

1050
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:30,788
Good to be here, Bob.

1051
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:38,796
Hello?

1052
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,714
<i>- Jane!</i>
- Alex?

1053
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:44,635
Look, listen to me.
Blair is out of control.

1054
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:45,963
I saw his people last night,

1055
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,573
they killed a man
right in front of me.

1056
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,435
Blair's here now. He's brought
the President with him.

1057
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:55,187
President?

1058
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:56,730
<i>Of the United States?</i>

1059
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,190
Yes.

1060
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:00,317
<i>Paul could be right.</i>

1061
01:12:00,526 --> 01:12:01,527
About what?

1062
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,280
He thinks the President
is in danger.

1063
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:09,410
No, you can't call the cops.
Blair owns the cops...

1064
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:12,037
and the FBI.

1065
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:14,498
Alex?

1066
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:19,086
Jane, I'm coming back.
We've got to stop Blair.

1067
01:12:19,295 --> 01:12:21,046
<i>Listen, there's
security everywhere.</i>

1068
01:12:21,964 --> 01:12:23,841
I'll leave the door open
at the loading dock.

1069
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:25,467
I think it's your best chance.

1070
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:28,178
You be careful.

1071
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:30,014
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

1072
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:32,808
You just keep yourself alive.

1073
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:35,394
Count on it.

1074
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:08,218
Go, go!
Cover the track!

1075
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:13,974
No!

1076
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:17,269
I owe you a beating,
you son of a bitch!

1077
01:13:17,478 --> 01:13:18,854
Let me talk to Snead.
Come on!

1078
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:20,147
- Hey, Snead!
- Snead!

1079
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:22,983
This better be good,
because McClaren there,

1080
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:24,753
he'd just love to tear you
a new asshole.

1081
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:25,777
Snead, I need your help.

1082
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:26,653
Now, why should I help you?

1083
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:29,182
Come on, Snead, do me a favor,
I'll give you three winners.

1084
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,866
- Make it six.
- Five.

1085
01:13:31,075 --> 01:13:32,075
You're on.

1086
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:33,470
Look. There's going to be
some people coming here

1087
01:13:33,494 --> 01:13:35,221
in a couple of minutes.
They're going to be in a hurry,

1088
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,389
and I want you to
slow 'em down for me.

1089
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,998
No problem.

1090
01:13:38,207 --> 01:13:38,832
Hey, Alex...

1091
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,167
you welch on us...

1092
01:13:40,376 --> 01:13:41,585
you're a dead man.

1093
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:51,387
You're scaring the horses!

1094
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:39,308
Cover the main gate!

1095
01:14:40,352 --> 01:14:41,728
Bring more cars around!

1096
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:00,080
<i>Operator.</i>

1097
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:02,291
Connect me with Fred
Schoenstein's room, please.

1098
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:03,292
<i>- Staff?</i>
- No, no, no.

1099
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,003
He's with the President's party.

1100
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,212
<i>Schoenstein...</i>

1101
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:09,381
Hello?

1102
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:41,538
Is there a problem, Paul?

1103
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,082
What are you doing?

1104
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,252
It does not concern you.

1105
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:49,254
Oh, I think it does.

1106
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:55,219
I'm afraid everything
concerns me now.

1107
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:57,971
Will you excuse me?

1108
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,435
If something's
deeply troubling you,

1109
01:16:03,644 --> 01:16:05,354
let's sit down...

1110
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:06,855
talk about it.

1111
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:10,943
Should we, really?

1112
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:14,947
Should we talk about what you
intend to do to the President?

1113
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:17,658
I thought that was clear.

1114
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:22,037
I intend to put an end
to his nightmares.

1115
01:16:22,246 --> 01:16:24,248
Of that I'm sure of.

1116
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:27,209
It's over now, Blair.

1117
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,627
I'll see to that.

1118
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,004
No one's going to believe you.

1119
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:34,633
By God, I'll make them
believe me.

1120
01:16:37,094 --> 01:16:42,140
I came to you
with important research.

1121
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:44,935
Designed to illuminate.

1122
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:47,062
Not to destroy.

1123
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:50,566
Didn't I provide you
with everything you needed?

1124
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:56,029
You took something that
was vital, and very important,

1125
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,407
and you corrupted it.

1126
01:17:00,576 --> 01:17:02,119
You let me.

1127
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:05,998
Yes.

1128
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:08,292
To my eternal shame.

1129
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:09,019
Dammit!

1130
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:27,663
Alex, thank God you're here.

1131
01:18:35,087 --> 01:18:38,799
He's going to die
in his sleep, Tommy.

1132
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:44,346
After all of the stress
he's been undergoing lately,

1133
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:47,474
no one will suspect a thing.

1134
01:18:47,683 --> 01:18:50,394
So, don't worry.

1135
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:54,147
Regular heroes, aren't we, Bob?

1136
01:18:56,775 --> 01:18:58,026
Yeah.

1137
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,656
Sure, Tommy.

1138
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:10,163
Make sure that's under his head.
The boxes will hide him nicely.

1139
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:13,125
I don't want that thing
coming off.

1140
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,376
I'll take it from here.

1141
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,584
Fine.

1142
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:16,813
I'm going to stay with Blair.

1143
01:19:16,837 --> 01:19:18,755
Make sure the car is clean
when you're done.

1144
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,924
Right.

1145
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:37,148
Ah!

1146
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:40,819
I know what noises you're
liable to make when you hear me.

1147
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,237
Don't be a fool.

1148
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:44,698
Why did Blair
bring the President here?

1149
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:46,074
I don't know.

1150
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:47,868
Some tests!

1151
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:50,162
- Alex.
- What?

1152
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,247
What is it?

1153
01:19:52,456 --> 01:19:53,582
Come here.

1154
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,835
All right, out of the car.

1155
01:19:57,836 --> 01:19:59,421
Come on.

1156
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,681
Oh, God.

1157
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,767
Oh.

1158
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:17,731
You bastard!

1159
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,649
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

1160
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,735
What did he know, bitch?
What did he know?

1161
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,737
Huh?

1162
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,089
Blair's planning on
putting Tommy Ray

1163
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:26,215
in the President's dream, right?

1164
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,239
- Yes.
- You tell me!

1165
01:20:27,282 --> 01:20:28,282
Yes!

1166
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:29,659
How's he going to do it?

1167
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,369
The dream chamber?

1168
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:32,871
Alex, come on.

1169
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:34,539
Tell me, you son of a bitch,

1170
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:36,708
or I'm going to put your brains
all over this car.

1171
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:38,084
He...

1172
01:20:38,794 --> 01:20:42,547
The President's in the room
next to Tommy Ray...

1173
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,036
When the President
goes to sleep,

1174
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:46,134
- they're going to...
- That's all I want to know.

1175
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:49,303
Let's go.

1176
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:52,682
I'm going into that dream,
and I'm going to stop Tommy Ray.

1177
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:02,651
He's asleep.

1178
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:06,404
Won't be long before
I can go in.

1179
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:08,239
Let's use my office.

1180
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,950
It's right beneath
the President's room.

1181
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:11,918
I think you'll be
close enough there to link.

1182
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:17,457
No lights.
Lock the door.

1183
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:23,815
Take your time, Alex.
Otherwise, you won't be able...

1184
01:21:23,839 --> 01:21:28,218
Screw "otherwise"!
It might be too late already.

1185
01:21:39,396 --> 01:21:41,857
It's not working.

1186
01:21:44,776 --> 01:21:48,363
Okay, okay.
Now use your breathing.

1187
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:40,832
Mr. President.
Listen to me.

1188
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:44,294
Your life is in danger.
Bob Blair is trying to kill you.

1189
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:46,796
What the hell
are you talking about?

1190
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,716
He sent somebody into this dream
to assassinate you.

1191
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:51,508
Who are you?

1192
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:53,303
I'm here to help you.

1193
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,680
Look, all you got to do
is wake up.

1194
01:22:55,889 --> 01:22:57,682
- Wake up?
- That's right.

1195
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:59,184
Wake up.
Try, concentrate.

1196
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:00,518
Wake up!

1197
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:02,354
They gave me a sedative.

1198
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:04,105
A sedative?

1199
01:23:04,314 --> 01:23:05,499
Well, we're just going
to have to

1200
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:07,359
ride this out
until it wears off.

1201
01:23:21,081 --> 01:23:22,832
I did this.

1202
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:24,918
I caused it.

1203
01:23:25,126 --> 01:23:26,127
That's not true.

1204
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,756
It's all a dream.
None of it's real.

1205
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:32,801
Hello, Mr. President.

1206
01:23:34,636 --> 01:23:36,054
Alex.

1207
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,056
What a surprise.

1208
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:40,684
I get to kill two
for the price of one.

1209
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:45,063
Okay, what seems
to be the trouble here?

1210
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:49,109
No trouble.
No trouble at all.

1211
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,152
Then, move on, son.

1212
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,154
Abracadabra.

1213
01:23:54,364 --> 01:23:55,364
Hm..

1214
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:03,415
You sick bastard!

1215
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:08,837
Alex...

1216
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:10,380
have a heart.

1217
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:20,056
It's a dream, Alex!

1218
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:21,975
You can do anything you want
in here!

1219
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:23,893
Haven't you figured
that out yet?

1220
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:38,366
Help me.

1221
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:40,410
Help me.

1222
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,166
There he is...

1223
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:49,586
He's the one who
pushed the button.

1224
01:24:49,878 --> 01:24:51,588
He did this to you.

1225
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:53,840
He did this to you!

1226
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,301
He did this to you!

1227
01:25:24,913 --> 01:25:25,955
Alex.

1228
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:31,294
You guys like Bruce Lee movies?

1229
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:34,672
I saw <i>Enter the Dragon</i>
six times.

1230
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:39,761
You blew it, Alex.

1231
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,489
While you were fooling around
with Novotny,

1232
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:45,058
I was learning
how to take advantage in here.

1233
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:51,231
In this world,
you're nothing, Alex.

1234
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:52,565
And me...

1235
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:54,109
I'm God.

1236
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:00,115
End of the line, boys!

1237
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:02,992
Aw!

1238
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:11,251
I know something
you're really afraid of, Alex.

1239
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:21,677
Run!

1240
01:26:25,348 --> 01:26:26,348
Run!

1241
01:27:36,211 --> 01:27:37,337
Come on.

1242
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:39,130
Through here.

1243
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:57,106
It's a dead end.

1244
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,402
Nowhere to run.

1245
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,780
Maybe we don't run.

1246
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:24,152
Tommy.

1247
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:25,737
Tommy Ray.

1248
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:30,408
Why, Tommy?

1249
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:32,327
Why did you do it to me?

1250
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:34,620
Why, Tommy?

1251
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:37,332
Daddy?

1252
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:40,793
I loved you, Tommy Ray.

1253
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:43,254
Daddy, I'm sorry.

1254
01:30:16,204 --> 01:30:18,373
He's dead.

1255
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,208
Dead?

1256
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,712
Alex.

1257
01:30:25,254 --> 01:30:27,465
Are you all right?

1258
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,060
What happened?

1259
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,897
It's okay.

1260
01:30:43,106 --> 01:30:45,733
I stopped the bastard.

1261
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:52,323
John.

1262
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:55,033
Is anything the matter?

1263
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:56,369
You all right?

1264
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:59,455
Bob. Stay away from me.

1265
01:30:59,664 --> 01:31:00,373
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1266
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:01,833
No, no.

1267
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,877
Don't excuse us.
Don't leave me for an instant.

1268
01:31:05,086 --> 01:31:05,837
Let's go back to your room.

1269
01:31:06,045 --> 01:31:08,297
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1270
01:31:08,506 --> 01:31:11,717
You put that maniac
in my dream to kill me.

1271
01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:13,677
I wonder if you know

1272
01:31:13,845 --> 01:31:17,765
just how crazy that sounds,
Mr. President.

1273
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:21,144
You'll never get away with this.

1274
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:24,564
You can't touch me, John.

1275
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:26,149
And you know that.

1276
01:31:28,025 --> 01:31:29,235
We're leaving.

1277
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:39,401
I think we should get as far
away from here as possible.

1278
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:41,581
You're damn right.

1279
01:31:44,459 --> 01:31:46,586
Hold it right there!

1280
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:51,549
It's okay.

1281
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:54,594
Thank you...

1282
01:31:54,802 --> 01:31:57,472
I don't know how you did it.

1283
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,432
But thank you for my life.

1284
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:00,516
I'm just glad

1285
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:03,060
we got out of there
in one piece, Mr. President.

1286
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:06,522
Sir?
What about Bob Blair?

1287
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:08,733
Blair.

1288
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:10,651
He's a very powerful man.

1289
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,945
He's going to be
coming after me.

1290
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:15,364
He can't afford
to have me alive.

1291
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:18,534
I'll assign some men to you.

1292
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:22,330
I appreciate that, sir.

1293
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:24,790
But I think I should deal
with this on my own.

1294
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,104
How did you get in here?

1295
01:32:47,313 --> 01:32:49,232
It was easy.

1296
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:03,329
Bob.

1297
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:08,292
You're going to be late.

1298
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:09,919
Bob.

1299
01:33:11,379 --> 01:33:12,797
Bob.

1300
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:15,675
Bob.

1301
01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:21,347
Alex, what happened
to you last night?

1302
01:33:21,556 --> 01:33:23,076
You look like you
didn't get any sleep.

1303
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:25,518
I didn't,
but I had one hell of a dream.

1304
01:33:25,726 --> 01:33:26,726
This is crazy.

1305
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:27,478
Crazy, Jane?

1306
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,447
This is fun.
Where's your sense of adventure?

1307
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:32,441
Adventure? You call going
to Louisville an adventure?

1308
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,985
What's wrong with Louisville?

1309
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,279
Churchill Downs
is in Louisville.

1310
01:33:36,487 --> 01:33:39,532
You don't happen to be planning
on doing any gambling, do you?

1311
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,033
Jane, you know I never gamble.

1312
01:33:41,242 --> 01:33:42,743
So, then, why are we going?

1313
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:44,221
Where we're going
is not important.

1314
01:33:44,245 --> 01:33:47,164
What's important is that it
takes three days to get there.

1315
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,959
I haven't been
on a train in years.

1316
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:51,627
Oh, that's not
exactly true, Jane.

1317
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:55,881
Ooh, nice.

1318
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:09,729
Wait a minute.

1319
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,731
What if it's not
as good as the dream?

1320
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:13,941
It will be.

1321
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,569
How do you know?

1322
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:18,195
Maybe I'm a little bit psychic.

1323
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:20,114
Yeah?

1324
01:34:20,323 --> 01:34:22,033
Tickets?

1325
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,076
Tickets, please.

1326
01:34:31,042 --> 01:34:32,335
Thank you.

1327
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:34,879
Have a good trip.
