1
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,953
Murder! Murder!

2
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,561
I've never earned a nickel
from another man's sweat.

3
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,913
I never said that, Jack!
I said fifty-fifty!

4
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,594
I don't need any partners!

5
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,435
You can't do it alone! Not out here!

6
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,201
I'll find the gold! Say it!

7
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,840
Say it, you spawn of a Danish whore!

8
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,395
Say it!

9
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,716
Say it!

10
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,555
Jack McCann will find the gold!

11
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,674
Louder! So God in his heaven can hear you!

12
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,711
Jack McCann will find the gold!

13
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,550
Alone!

14
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,074
I never earned a nickel
from another man's sweat.

15
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,641
I never earned a nickel
from another man's sweat!

16
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,194
I've never earned a nickel
from another man's sweat!

17
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,353
Come on, children. Come over here.

18
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,112
What are you smiling at?

19
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,119
What are you smiling at?

20
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,792
The end.

21
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,678
It's not over until it's over.

22
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,640
Children, come on! Come over here!

23
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,954
Come right now!

24
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,834
Hurry! Come over here!

25
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,961
Go and help your father.

26
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,401
Look at you. You're a mess.

27
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,036
Fuck.

28
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,832
It's not over till it's over.

29
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,839
- No.
- Would you ever?

30
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,993
Sure I do. Don't I, Frieda?

31
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,320
Hello, Johnny.

32
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,390
Hey. Frieda, shut the door.

33
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,951
This is Johnny.

34
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,071
He's come home.

35
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,800
If you got it, Frieda will have it.

36
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,037
Don't think you've got lucky.

37
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,678
Write if you get work, Johnny.

38
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,354
How about clearing snow?

39
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,956
- Maybe I'm dead.
- Only most of you.

40
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,797
What have you got in your hand, Johnny?

41
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,640
It's a rock. I found it.

42
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,434
No, Johnny.

43
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,154
This stone found you.

44
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,398
It has your name on it.

45
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,634
Not outside, but inside.

46
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,439
It's your destiny.

47
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,113
But everybody pays.

48
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,830
Everybody pays.

49
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,391
Gold smells stronger than a woman.

50
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,832
Tonight, I took a bath,
maybe because of you.

51
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,477
It's been a long time...

52
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,071
Jack.

53
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,673
My Jack.

54
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,641
We never did find the gold,
but we had something...

55
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,716
something between us
that was as good as gold.

56
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,119
My Jack had all the nuggets we needed...

57
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,796
right between his legs.

58
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,201
You interested in men and women?

59
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,953
With you, the gold is everything.

60
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,759
You never give up.

61
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,713
We had a crock of gold between us...

62
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,401
his cock and my crack.

63
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,313
A crock of gold.

64
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,757
More than love, it was. It was a power.

65
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,480
In love...

66
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,957
Jack was an alchemist.

67
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,036
God, were we on fire.

68
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,595
Then one morning, I woke up.
The sun was shining.

69
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,958
It was spring, and Jack was dead.

70
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,877
Dead beside me.

71
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,199
Dead in bed.

72
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,035
That must have been when
I started to smell bad.

73
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,080
You've had quite a life.

74
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,956
So will you.

75
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,154
Then there's some...

76
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,916
leftover life to kill.

77
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,480
My Jack...

78
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,471
and his perfume of Paris...

79
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,954
Paris and the golden coach.

80
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,191
You'll find what you're looking for...

81
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,311
but after?

82
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,679
It's right here.

83
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,153
I can see it.

84
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,554
The gold.

85
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,632
It runs like a river
to the shore of the lake.

86
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,511
There it goes, diving underwater.

87
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,592
- Understand what this means?
- Yeah.

88
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,951
My luck has changed.

89
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,160
Luck's for ordinary men, not you.

90
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,877
When you took the stone,
you made your choice.

91
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,271
You're alone now.

92
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,155
I never earned a nickel
from another man's sweat!

93
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,717
Hey, Frieda!

94
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,881
Frieda, it's over!

95
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,394
I'm dying, Paris.

96
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,598
Wait.

97
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,032
What...

98
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,919
what happens now?

99
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,315
A mystery.

100
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,919
The end and the beginning.

101
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,151
No.

102
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,400
There'll be another after you...

103
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,321
after the war.

104
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,959
The great events.

105
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,081
They were great days.

106
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,080
Not just good, but great.

107
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,792
That car's a dud.

108
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,474
I could have lived for ten years
up here on what that car cost.

109
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,561
In those days...

110
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,200
every goddamn thing was so hard.

111
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,913
What did you do for girls up here?

112
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,355
I guess we did without...

113
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,318
unlike some people I know.

114
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,518
Suppose I'd been here.

115
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,479
Would you have given me a second glance?

116
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,040
No.

117
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,676
My darling Tracy...

118
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,471
I never would have taken my eyes off you.

119
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,434
Tell me more about the gold.

120
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,234
I love the stories.

121
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,351
Where'd you get this?

122
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,280
He gave you this, didn't he?

123
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,320
Give me a pull.

124
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,679
That guy is no good for you.

125
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,671
You think I'm jealous.

126
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,157
I am not jealous.

127
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,833
I just know he'll never appreciate you.

128
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,481
Oh, appreciate be damned.

129
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,757
I'm not a work of art.
I'm not a piece of china.

130
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,115
I want him.

131
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,111
Are you sure?

132
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,437
I wanted to thank you for Paris.

133
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,274
I didn't thank you.

134
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,398
I guess I take it all for granted.

135
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,794
I had a wonderful time.

136
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,871
Do you think...

137
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,840
you think you can pull
the jib back, you know?

138
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,756
You're safe with me. Come on.

139
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,801
Now... hold the wheel.

140
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,996
- Hold it.
- Yeah?

141
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,638
Oh, I'm so happy!

142
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,161
I should have stopped it.

143
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,790
Helen, lay off the sauce, will you?

144
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,840
I think I'm beginning to go blind.

145
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,752
How are they doing out there?

146
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,315
I'll win.

147
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,154
I'll always win.

148
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,431
I won you, didn't I?

149
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,992
You did, cheri. Fair and square.

150
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,321
Tracy. Tracy.

151
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,080
Got to hand it to your son-in-law.

152
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,992
Sure can handle a yacht.

153
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,831
- Jack, I need some new glasses.
- My daughter!

154
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,036
You're in good humour again today.

155
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,880
You made a mistake there, Jack.

156
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,392
Tracy's our daughter. She's mine, too.

157
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,514
That frog didn't seduce Tracy McCann...

158
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,955
because she's your daughter.

159
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,876
Do you believe that?

160
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,080
Maybe I'm a jinx.

161
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,515
Yes. Maybe.

162
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,315
What does it mean, "jinx"?

163
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,756
Jack, have you given any more thought
to our Luna Bay deal?

164
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,356
Our deal?

165
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,875
You mean us? You? Me?

166
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,560
Us?

167
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,917
Luna Bay is me, Charlie.

168
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,751
It's a part of me.

169
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,150
So am I. I'm your friend,
not just your partner.

170
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,160
I think about you. I fend for you.

171
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,356
What's everybody gonna think
if they think you're going...

172
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,996
Charlie, I don't care what anybody thinks.

173
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,479
Listen. I've figured an angle.

174
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,599
I think maybe... maybe we can
put one over on Mayakofsky.

175
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,796
Tell him that Luna Bay...

176
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,032
I don't want to put one
over on anybody, Charlie.

177
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,076
I never cheated a man in my life.

178
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,555
Only women.

179
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,436
Helen, lay off the sauce.

180
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,194
Take it easy now, Jack. Look.

181
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,079
I may have to go to Miami
to talk to Mayakofsky.

182
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,151
What do you want me to say to him?

183
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,637
What was the name of that
optician in Miami? You remember.

184
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,275
You'll think of something to say, Charlie.

185
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,198
You always do.

186
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,921
He's right...

187
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,759
again. Have a drink.

188
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,319
No. I haven't eaten all day. I'm hungry.

189
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,393
You are, aren't you, Charlie?

190
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,359
You're hungry. That's right.

191
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,080
Now, try to understand, will you?

192
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,754
This island is mine...

193
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,316
and the Luna Bay deal don't mean
shit to a tree to me.

194
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,634
I'm out of all that.
Wheels and deals and seals.

195
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,155
It's all bullshit.

196
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,871
Maybe that's what you tell
that yid in Miami.

197
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,037
Jack McCann's out of it.

198
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,595
Out of it.

199
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,910
- Out of it.
- Yeah.

200
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,151
Out of it.

201
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,681
I have to make a call.

202
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,592
Good luck.

203
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,236
Doesn't it ever snow out here?

204
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,398
Excuse me, madam.
The fortune teller is here.

205
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,914
Fat nigger fraud.

206
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,551
You don't want your fortune told.

207
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,517
You've got a fortune.

208
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,796
If only your father could see you now.

209
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,276
The world's richest man.

210
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,358
Crazy... like a fox...

211
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,078
wearing a dress with parrot shit
on his shoulders.

212
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,798
Maybe this lady can tell me
what happened to you.

213
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,190
It was so wonderful...

214
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,033
once upon a time...

215
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,312
all those years ago.

216
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,556
Weren't we in love on that ship?

217
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,716
We were wonderful together, Jack.

218
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,195
We were shining.

219
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,831
Miami Herald. Miami Herald.

220
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,799
All the latest for you.

221
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,599
War news here. The Miami Herald.

222
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,794
Got a Miami Herald, lady?

223
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,312
60 enemy ships put out of the way...

224
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,233
and our planes are still packing...

225
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,275
Buon giorno, Aurelio. How's the war?

226
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,193
Which one, Mr. Mayakofsky?
Europe or the Pacific?

227
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,795
Ours. Ours.

228
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,360
Charles Perkins called.

229
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,631
He sounds nervous.

230
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,675
He's nervous?

231
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,240
We're all nervous.

232
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,196
Very nervous time, isn't it?

233
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,477
Well, he wants to come and see you.

234
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,120
McCann's stalling.

235
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,272
Delays. Delays. More delays.

236
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,193
God in heaven, what does the man want?

237
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,876
We're in business. Doesn't he understand?

238
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,237
I have friends. I have partners.

239
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,880
He lives on an island.
We live on the mainland.

240
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,160
He's a strange character,
and after the gold, he just...

241
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,193
Aurelio, please. Please.

242
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,760
There's no such thing as strange.

243
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,360
This is only a man.

244
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,239
A man is made up of desires.

245
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,278
Understand his desires,
you understand the man.

246
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,472
It's very simple. They go hand in hand.

247
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,396
Your Italian's better than my Yiddish.

248
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,441
This is a happy man.

249
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,640
This is a happy man. Look.

250
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,120
Get me a recent picture.

251
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,630
Who is he now?

252
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,150
Find out what McCann desires...

253
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,759
and we'll close the Luna Bay
deal, Aurelio, but soon.

254
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,838
But soon.

255
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,241
Ah, my daughter Esther.

256
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,156
Esther, this is Aurelio.

257
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,197
Hello, Esther.

258
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,760
Have some tea. Have some tea.

259
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,232
I've often wondered about this stone.

260
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,151
It's a relic of the past, like me.

261
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,117
You're full of secrets, Jack, aren't you?

262
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,999
Me? No. No.

263
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm an open book.

264
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,554
Cut me, and I bleed just like anyone else.

265
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,236
Pearl, take these, will you, please?

266
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,916
Why did you ask me here?

267
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,438
I thought maybe you needed
some help being set up.

268
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,755
No, thank you...

269
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,912
but I don't spend much money anyway.

270
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,873
I do have one extravagance.

271
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,395
Tracy.

272
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,120
No. My yacht.

273
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,516
You see, I...

274
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,233
don't ever want to owe you anything.

275
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,039
I hope you'll understand.

276
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,517
You seem to get along quite well
with the natives, don't you?

277
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,238
Yes. That's true.

278
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,994
It's the whites who don't like me.

279
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,113
Hello, Claude.

280
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,555
I haven't offended you, have I?

281
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,160
Oh, no.

282
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,717
You understand it's often harder
to receive than it is to give.

283
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,916
Hello.

284
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,195
Claude was just leaving.

285
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,832
Have either of you seen
my long-distance glasses?

286
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,552
I've mislaid them again.

287
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,076
I found them in the dining room.

288
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,391
How clever of you. Thank you.

289
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,120
In the dining room.

290
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,476
While I was waiting.

291
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,995
Oh, he does keep people
waiting, doesn't he?

292
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,356
Enchanté.

293
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,031
I can't do that.
I can't threaten him like that.

294
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,554
Well, in life, there are
many unpleasant things...

295
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,631
that have to be done.

296
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,754
It's a matter of honour, Mr. Mayakofsky.

297
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,434
I'm an American.

298
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,194
So who's not an American?

299
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,038
Everyone is an American now.

300
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,680
The Germans? They're Americans.

301
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,991
In Chicago, there's many Germans.

302
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,196
Come on.

303
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,880
The Japanese?

304
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,681
Believe me, one day,
they'll all be Americans, also.

305
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,717
Languages. That's all the difference.

306
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,394
This war, what is it?

307
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,791
It's a war between Americans...

308
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,077
who all speak different languages...

309
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,720
so how can we lose?

310
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,559
Mr. McCann's an American.

311
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,554
He knows we're all on the same side.

312
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,041
You talk to him.

313
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,239
Arrange for him to meet
my associate Mr. D'Amato.

314
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,240
Be careful.

315
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,474
You think of this as a problem?

316
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,635
This is no problem.

317
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,996
Think of it as an opportunity.

318
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,437
Do you think Mr. Perkins
has unwisely informed McCann...

319
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,194
that we wish to build
a casino on Luna Bay?

320
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,591
I think that Mr. Perkins
is certainly very worried...

321
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,592
about something.

322
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,241
He's very close to McCann.

323
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,120
Well, it's good for us.

324
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,157
It might also be very bad for everyone.

325
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,552
Jack is beginning to remind me
of Lucky and that's not good.

326
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,720
One Lucky in my life is plenty of Luckies.

327
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,872
No.

328
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,400
Jack is going to get sick very soon.

329
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,551
Please don't.

330
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,473
You know I don't believe
in those stupid signs.

331
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,234
Signs are numbers.

332
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,159
It's all numbers.

333
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,876
Seconds, hours, days, years.

334
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,237
You understand. You're good at math.

335
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,791
Oh, that is really...

336
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,678
quite something.

337
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,592
Don't frighten me.

338
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,039
You can do what you'd like to my body.

339
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,115
I don't care.

340
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,279
It's all wonderful.

341
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,475
For God's sakes...

342
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,114
leave my mind alone.

343
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,599
Stick to my skin, huh?

344
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,992
Ah, Tracy.

345
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,516
You're such a child.

346
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,154
Isn't that the way you want me?

347
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,036
What is it?

348
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,677
Those tests last year in Miami.

349
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,796
They were inconclusive.

350
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,600
Is that what we're gonna be?

351
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,235
Inconclusive?

352
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,834
I don't need a child to love you.

353
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,677
I just don't want us to be incomplete.

354
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,997
We're complete... now.

355
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,270
Perfect.

356
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,191
100,036.

357
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,999
Jack never needed one of those things.

358
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,194
He's absolutely right.

359
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,477
He's very clever, my husband, isn't he?

360
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,881
Not nearly as clever as my daughter.

361
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,912
- Try one of your numbers on her.
- Oh, no.

362
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,152
The length doesn't matter.
She can handle it.

363
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,834
Let's take the 100,036
and divide it by, say...

364
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,601
one hundred and seventy-eight.

365
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,791
Five hundred...

366
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,956
sixty-two?

367
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,678
Is that right?

368
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,795
That's incredible.

369
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,836
It's a gift.

370
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,076
I'm sure that's not your
only talent, Miss McCann.

371
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,716
Well, what is your occupation?

372
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,480
On this planet, I mean.

373
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,120
Mr. D'Amato's a businessman.

374
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,998
Business.

375
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,832
- Lawyer.
- Real estate?

376
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,071
Lawyer, you said.

377
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,954
Business. Thieves among thieves...

378
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,479
pirates stealing from each other.

379
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,721
Very fine piece you have.

380
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,241
Yes.

381
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,236
Kind of stupid to make
a saltcellar out of gold.

382
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,796
Stupid, my ass.

383
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,793
The alchemists made gold out of salt.

384
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,080
Oh, no, Jack. It's bad luck.

385
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,914
Throw some over your shoulder quickly.

386
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,833
I don't believe in luck, good or bad...

387
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,396
but everybody believes
in a little bit of gold...

388
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,399
even if it's just a wedding band.

389
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,754
No. Leave it. Let it burn.

390
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,714
Where's my necklace?

391
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,280
I forgot.

392
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,637
She thought it was ostentatious.

393
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,879
Ostentatious?

394
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,481
Look at that goddamn shirt.

395
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,558
This represents the teaching
of the cabala.

396
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,001
Are you a yid?

397
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,959
The search for wisdom is universal, Jack.

398
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,156
There are five points.

399
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,035
The first is silence.

400
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,640
The second is listening.

401
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,193
The third is remembrance, and...

402
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,397
the fourth is practice.

403
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,399
And the fifth is teaching.

404
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,354
And the sixth... bullshit.

405
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,555
There's only one golden rule...

406
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,558
"Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you."

407
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,196
The rest is conversation.

408
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,839
You didn't earn the gold, Jack.

409
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,036
You took it from nature.

410
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,278
You raped the earth.

411
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,272
I found it.

412
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,801
You stole it.

413
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,114
What the hell do you do,
pluck chickens for a living?

414
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,914
Stop it, please.

415
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,880
He only does it to annoy
because he knows it teases.

416
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,391
Tracy In Wonderland.

417
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,797
The Mad Hatter's tea party.

418
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,480
This is it.

419
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,520
There's no chocolate inside.

420
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,116
Well, you can't undo it, Mr. D'Amato.

421
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,800
It's gold.

422
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,151
Well, Jack likes to give
gold presents after dinner.

423
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,318
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

424
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,475
You can't take it with you.

425
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,115
What are you doing?

426
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,392
Get out of my house!

427
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,715
It's only gold, Jack.

428
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,635
Like all things, it'll pass...

429
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,280
and when it does,
I'll send it back to you.

430
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,313
Tracy, get him out of here.

431
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,712
- I never want to see him again.
- Oh, stop it. Stop it!

432
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,556
Whose side are you on, Charlie?

433
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,680
Get out of here! Vanish!

434
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,640
- Tracy, you can't just leave.
- We're going, Mother.

435
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,681
Don't do it to yourself, Jack.

436
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,511
I won't rest until I see that man dead.

437
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,551
Charlie, how are you?

438
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,711
OK. OK, Jack.

439
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,596
Jack.

440
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,751
It's good to see you, Charlie.

441
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,559
Jack. I'm in trouble, Jack.

442
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,551
Charlie. Charlie.

443
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,233
What in God's name have
you been thinking about?

444
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,596
I've been carrying a gun lately...

445
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,520
up at my house the last
two nights in a row.

446
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,073
I keep hearing strange sounds like...

447
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,039
I know somebody's trying to break in.

448
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,397
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.

449
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,552
You're frightened somebody's trying
to break into your house.

450
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,792
I'm frightened somebody's trying
to break into my life!

451
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,435
Jack, we're partners.

452
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,592
You owe it to us to give
this thing a chance.

453
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,511
Oh, Charlie. Two things.

454
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,272
First, I don't believe in chance.

455
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,838
Second, I don't have partners...

456
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,441
not for some time.

457
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,951
You're not getting it, Jack.
Mayakofsky's dangerous.

458
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,954
How can I get through to you?
This man's dangerous!

459
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,436
Charlie, who's the most
dangerous man I know?

460
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,713
You, Charlie?

461
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,559
No.

462
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,200
Me, Charlie.

463
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,954
I'm the most dangerous man I know.

464
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,921
Charlie, if you're frightened...

465
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,955
spend a while at Eureka.

466
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,280
Helen's going to Rhode Island...

467
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,154
to spend some time with the boys.

468
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,198
Thanks, Jack. I think
I'll take you up on that.

469
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,673
- I just wish that you could...
- Charlie.

470
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,592
Now, is there anything
you're not telling me?

471
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,198
I know it's tough being pig in the middle.

472
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,350
Not broke, are you?

473
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,910
Good.

474
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,959
Never mention this matter to me again.

475
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,030
Charlie.

476
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,477
Fuck you. You're so fucking selfish.

477
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,710
I'm very angry with Perkins.

478
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,835
I don't think he believes me...

479
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,791
and that's bad, not to believe.

480
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,754
Do you go to Confession?

481
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,115
Every week.

482
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,118
There's only one God
between all of us schmucks.

483
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,912
These men are without faith.

484
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,281
They believe in nothing.

485
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,711
I think that Jack McCann
believes in himself.

486
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,633
That's what I said.
He believes in nothing.

487
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,955
He makes me meshuga.

488
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,001
How can you do business with
a man who believes in nothing?

489
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,037
He's not a businessman.

490
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,318
Then we shall have to find some other way.

491
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,591
I have to buy, so he must sell.

492
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:48,155
He must sign because we have to build.

493
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,674
He dug up his fortune.

494
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,159
We cannot allow him to stand in the way...

495
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,232
of new men who want
to build their fortunes.

496
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:05,635
Jack McCann is a dinosaur, Aurelio...

497
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,678
and everyone knows
what happened to dinosaurs.

498
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,594
He has outlived his time.

499
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,119
Regrettably, we must apply pressure.

500
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,552
When?

501
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,840
No time like the present.

502
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,880
Thank you for letting me
sleep here with you tonight.

503
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,513
It reminds me of our first
days together on the ship.

504
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,751
I suppose you think that's sentimental.

505
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,835
What's really wrong?

506
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,319
I'm under siege by everybody
and everything.

507
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,474
Well, if only...

508
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,790
if only people here liked you more.

509
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,753
It's not me that they hate.
It's what I represent.

510
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,039
I'm the fellow who knew what he wanted...

511
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,555
and went out and got it.

512
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,918
Tough act to follow.

513
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,277
Oh, but that was such a long time ago.

514
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,554
You are a different man now.

515
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,791
Yeah.

516
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,275
I want to help you.

517
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,440
Why won't you let me?

518
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,361
Nobody can help me.

519
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,553
You know what eternity looks like?

520
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,192
It's white, yet very dark.

521
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,639
It's like a desert of snow at night.

522
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,711
Now I've reached the edge of eternity...

523
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,960
and beyond eternity.

524
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,801
The abyss.

525
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,476
Nothing.

526
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,913
Once upon a time, I was Jack McCann.

527
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,515
I had a name.

528
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,440
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on, Helen.

529
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,919
I'm in the middle of
my Second World War...

530
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,197
and I still can't hear.

531
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,399
What you said to me the other day
about my not being able to see...

532
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,121
You're so damn right.
I can't see, and I can't hear.

533
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,555
I'm paralyzed.

534
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,394
Once I had it all.

535
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,759
Now I just have everything.

536
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,278
- Hello, Pierre.
- Hello, darling.

537
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,920
- C'est bon?
- I'm all right.

538
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,560
We better make this the last.

539
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,761
Ah, bon, Pierre.

540
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,436
Ca va?

541
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,000
Il faut que tu lis cette lettre, Claude.

542
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,554
Will everybody leave, please?

543
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,840
- I want every...
- What is it?

544
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:59,150
No, Tracy.

545
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,551
Everybody out now.

546
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,033
Come on, Claude. Pull yourself together.

547
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,952
It can't be as bad as that.

548
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,276
Claude!

549
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:29,080
Claude! Sit down. Sit down.

550
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,916
Claude.

551
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,516
- Claude!
- Just get them out of here!

552
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,957
My mother died.

553
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,351
I should have stayed in France.
I should...

554
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,915
I shouldn't have left.

555
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,839
She must have needed me, and...

556
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,030
I could have protected her.

557
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,761
Now there is nothing.

558
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:20,233
Sit down, sit down.

559
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,195
As a child, I...

560
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,037
ran away from school all the time.

561
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,400
She'd bring me back but...

562
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,111
never scolded me.

563
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,031
She knew all I wanted was...

564
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,152
to be free.

565
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,676
Then I...

566
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,956
then I ran away from her.

567
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,598
I ran away from France and...

568
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,718
ran away from the war.

569
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,113
I'm such a coward.

570
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,796
Tracy...

571
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,272
I'll never run away from you.

572
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,960
The last letter
she wrote to me, she said...

573
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:58,481
"The day Gone With The Wind
opens in Paris...

574
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:05,961
"the war will be over,
and we shall have won."

575
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,430
Maman.

576
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,199
Sometimes I wonder
whether I'm ready for you.

577
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,755
It's too much of you...

578
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,160
not enough of me.

579
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,440
Do you understand?

580
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,760
Very simple.

581
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,870
Oh, it makes me afraid for us.

582
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,273
"Dearest Father and Mother...

583
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,121
"This is the hardest letter
I have ever had to write...

584
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,910
"harder even than
the weekend ones from school.

585
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,280
"Something happened
to Claude this evening...

586
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,079
"which is none of your business...

587
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,598
"but which has made me think again
about my life with you both.

588
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,839
"I know that you will
never accept Claude...

589
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,435
"as part of our family.

590
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,081
"I can't blame you...

591
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,798
"because he's not of our blood...

592
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:43,277
"but he has become the centre of my life.

593
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:47,912
"My blood is his blood, and his is mine."

594
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,720
"I cannot bear the bitterness,
resentment, and pain...

595
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,758
"that surrounds the two of us."

596
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,755
"I can't bear the bitterness,
resentment...

597
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,993
"and pain that surrounds the two of us...

598
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,395
"especially not as your lives
seem so empty...

599
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,916
"now that I have found and felt...

600
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:10,311
"what it really means to be alive.

601
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,433
"I still love you both...

602
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,751
"but I love Claude
more than I love myself.

603
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:19,431
"His needs have become mine.

604
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,434
"He needs me now as I need myself.

605
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,194
"I would not exist without him.

606
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:26,998
"I will not tear myself apart...

607
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,593
"because of your unrelenting
hostility towards us.

608
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,321
"I don't want us to fight a war.

609
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,001
"I want us to live together in peace...

610
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,514
"but if that's not possible,
then I will find...

611
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:47,755
"a place of peace
within my heart with Claude.

612
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,197
"Mother, I mean what I said.

613
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,079
"I want to join you in Rhode Island.

614
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,478
"Your most loving daughter, Tracy."

615
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,234
Your car is ready, madam.

616
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,074
Well, why did she write that?

617
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,871
I thought she understood.

618
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,634
She does understand...

619
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,551
and so do I.

620
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,917
Come to bed.

621
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,436
What?

622
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,476
Jack, I really ought to go.

623
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,356
We don't have time.

624
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,391
Jack.

625
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,837
Jack. Jack, stop.

626
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:13,078
Remember always that I love you.

627
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

628
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:44,911
- Jack.
- What's the matter?

629
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:46,475
- What's the matter?
- Are you trying to kill me?

630
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:49,912
- Get out of my house.
- What do you want?

631
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,480
First I thought it was the money.

632
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,359
Then I thought it was my daughter.

633
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,714
Flesh of my flesh.

634
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,117
Look.

635
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,120
- The gold doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

636
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,033
Everything I gave you he's taken.

637
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,158
Stop it. What are you doing?

638
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,517
But the truth is, you want me.

639
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,439
You want my soul!

640
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,276
What are you doing? This is my bedroom.

641
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,192
Nothing is yours.

642
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:21,395
Look at yourself. Look.
You're twenty years old.

643
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,076
You're rotten, ruined, depraved.

644
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,152
- Jack!
- Get away from me!

645
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,073
Stop it! For God's sakes, stop it!

646
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,197
You're going to kill each other!

647
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,635
You're crazy.

648
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:32,314
Get off me!

649
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,311
Go on, then. You haven't got the guts.

650
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,552
- Yes, he does.
- Get off me!

651
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,200
I'll kill you if I have to.

652
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,471
Get off me!

653
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,151
Shut up, woman! It's just a little blood.

654
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,961
Get out.

655
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,279
Murder! Murder!

656
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,556
Stop it!

657
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,871
Why'd you make her write that letter?

658
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,476
What letter?

659
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,471
Stop it!

660
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,711
God knows...

661
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,391
I never made a nickel
from another man's sweat.

662
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,080
Daddy!

663
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,159
Say it, you spawn of a whore!

664
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:21,677
Jack McCann never made a nickel
on another man's sweat!

665
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,116
Kill me, you kill her.

666
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,271
Say it out loud so...

667
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,556
God in his heaven can...

668
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,556
hear you!

669
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,271
My God.

670
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,197
You get out of my world.

671
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,161
Your world?

672
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:57,952
Come back with me.

673
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,874
I can't.

674
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,799
Don't you see I can't?

675
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,321
Come back with me.

676
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:11,637
I don't want your gold.

677
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:16,030
I... I want flesh.

678
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:20,995
I want to touch human flesh.

679
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:23,356
I want...

680
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:27,875
I want to kiss it, hold it.

681
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,913
I want to suck it.

682
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,678
Oh, did you ever love someone...

683
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,912
all of someone?

684
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,152
I love all of him.

685
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,395
It's terrible...

686
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,640
the feeling.

687
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:58,434
Night and day, I can't get away from it.

688
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,352
It's not too late.

689
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:04,237
It is too late!
I wouldn't exist without him.

690
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,476
Oh, what have I done? I must go after him.

691
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,470
The triangle is broken.

692
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,839
Am I evil?

693
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,433
You look fantastic...

694
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,233
like Cleopatra.

695
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,881
Claude? Claude?

696
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:18,593
Claude, I was frightened.

697
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:20,556
Why?

698
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,678
I... I heard something go overboard.

699
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:25,234
You're safe with me.

700
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,516
You know...

701
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,276
yesterday...

702
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,921
last night...

703
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,430
was the most extraordinary day of my life.

704
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:47,001
Never be another day
or night like it ever.

705
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,477
I've never been so happy...

706
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:52,915
or so miserable.

707
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,400
The wind is picking up.

708
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,356
Did you want to kill Jack?

709
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,234
Didn't you?

710
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,516
He wanted to kill me.

711
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:15,915
I promise you, Tracy...

712
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,279
that won't happen again.

713
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:24,439
From now on, it's war.

714
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,559
It's going to be a tough fight
for Iwo Jima...

715
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,394
that tiny but strategic island...

716
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,872
only 750 miles south of Tokyo.

717
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,236
I'll get some envelopes.

718
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,755
Aurelio, wait. Wait, wait.

719
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,594
Don't bother. Just give it to them.

720
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,041
Come on. Get started.

721
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:03,153
Hello, Mom. Lay off the sauce, huh?

722
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:06,916
You hurt us, Tracy. That letter.

723
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,516
After you said you wanted
to be here with me and the boys.

724
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,875
My, you hurt us.

725
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:14,753
I was being honest.

726
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:20,517
Ohh. He's a wonderful man.

727
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,917
Oh, Joey, take my boots off, please.

728
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,399
Your father's a wonderful man.

729
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm going to bring him back
to the way he was.

730
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,794
Claude's not wonderful.

731
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,471
Claude's very charming,
very attractive to women...

732
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,041
lots of women.

733
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,512
I can see that.

734
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,311
Come on, Mom.

735
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,910
I haven't heard from your father
since I got here.

736
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,552
Do you want to kill him?

737
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:58,280
Why did you write the letter?
Why and what for?

738
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,239
A silly infatuation.

739
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,641
It can't last. They never do.

740
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,319
Perhaps it's all because of the war.

741
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,561
Jane, look. I'm going to go out.

742
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,711
Come on.

743
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,952
Good night, Mrs. Dawson. Stay careful.

744
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,000
Hello. How are you?

745
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,435
- Hello.
- Hello.

746
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,841
How are you?

747
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:34,799
You remember Claude Van Horn?

748
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,554
Yes. Of course. Don't be ridiculous.

749
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,234
Can't we all get in front?

750
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,761
I don't think so.

751
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,116
Oh, right.

752
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,679
All right. Mind your fingers.

753
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,321
- Ah. You ready?
- Go for a ride.

754
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,080
Jack, what happened to the servants?

755
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:53,839
I've given them the night off.

756
01:14:58,670 --> 01:14:59,671
Why?

757
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,561
It's for me.

758
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,236
Hello?

759
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,677
Is that Mrs. Maillot Van Horn?

760
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,240
Your call to Luna Bay...

761
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:21,721
There's no one answering there.

762
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:24,595
Would you keep trying for me, please?

763
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,274
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

764
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,631
You can't leave now!

765
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:36,554
Where's your gun, Charlie?

766
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,920
You're gonna need it
if you want to kill somebody.

767
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,311
Get away!

768
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,320
Jack, you can't run away from it!

769
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,755
They're coming here!

770
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:01,000
Great.

771
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,595
Hurry up.

772
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,796
Ladies.

773
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,600
We need the umbrella.

774
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:10,391
Here we are.

775
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,796
Come on.

776
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,521
Don't fall. I think you're
really going to enjoy it.

777
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,201
Thank you.

778
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:23,916
We love this.

779
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:39,960
Jane. Jane!

780
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:41,913
It's all right, Mary.

781
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,632
She's all right. She's all right.

782
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,156
I promise you, she's all right.

783
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:55,641
Let go!

784
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:00,310
Anything serious?

785
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:02,592
The cooler's overheating.

786
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,394
It's not serious.

787
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,559
Please. No, really. I... please.

788
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,631
I hope you... I hope you...

789
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:39,636
Claude!

790
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,272
Claude!

791
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:15,913
- Oh. Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, I feel it.

792
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,839
I'm sorry. There's still no answer.

793
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,037
Damn it.

794
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,194
Come here. Come here!

795
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,519
Looking for someone, Mr. McCann?

796
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:39,760
They've all gone.

797
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,311
A night like this...

798
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,711
isn't a particularly
good night for business.

799
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:00,911
Frieda!

800
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,721
Help me.

801
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,000
Come on.

802
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,197
Come on. Come on.

803
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:24,920
Mary.

804
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,594
Come on.

805
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,877
- Mary.
- Get out.

806
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,190
Will she be all right?

807
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,511
Don't be so scared. We're going home.

808
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,035
I've got to get her shoes.

809
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:39,991
Will it be all right?

810
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,356
Yeah. I'm pretty sure. Come on.

811
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,440
Oh, no. Oh, Mary, Mary!

812
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,592
You'll be all right, Mary.
I promise you. I promise you!

813
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,593
Come on! Come on!

814
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:52,072
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!
Don't let them touch me!

815
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:56,951
Please.

816
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:59,998
Please, don't touch me.

817
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:27,637
Jack! Jack! For Christ's sakes.

818
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:29,041
Jack, are you all right?

819
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,555
Yeah. Good.

820
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:36,391
We got to talk to these people, Jack.

821
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,799
I'm ready. Where are they?

822
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:40,991
Take me to them.

823
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,201
I smell perfume.

824
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,794
Have you had a woman in this car?

825
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:03,071
No.

826
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:08,516
Gold smells stronger than a woman.

827
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,552
You were at my house tonight.

828
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:16,321
A dinner party and candles...

829
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:18,797
a little wine, conversation...

830
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,639
a pleasant evening.

831
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:25,800
- Oh, come on, darling. Come on.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

832
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:27,355
Do you understand?

833
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,514
Give me my handkerchief.

834
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,396
All right.

835
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:44,231
- All right now.
- Buzz off.

836
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,634
Here. Take this.

837
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:49,195
- All right.
- See you.

838
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,877
Glad you decided to go through with this.

839
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,754
I've been waiting for this, Charlie...

840
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:58,161
for a long time...

841
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,240
a long, long time.

842
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,630
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

843
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:08,235
I want to give them ten more minutes.

844
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:10,153
Stay here. Look. Stay here.

845
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,996
All right.

846
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:23,796
All right?

847
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:33,556
What you saw tonight
is defendu, forbidden.

848
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,632
Don't breathe a word to anyone...

849
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:40,191
ever.

850
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,675
You understand?

851
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,396
Oh, sh...

852
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:57,556
Your handbags. Here. Here.

853
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,081
Good night.

854
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,352
I'm pleased you came, Mr. McCann.

855
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,877
This document needs your signature.

856
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,313
Goddamn. I forgot my pen.

857
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,199
Come on. I beg you
to see reason, Mr. McCann.

858
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:33,874
Call me Jack.

859
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:34,758
I see reason.

860
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,079
I see reasons everywhere.

861
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:39,952
I call it greed.

862
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:43,832
What a pity.

863
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:53,555
Hey. I got a medallion just like this.

864
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:54,751
Hey. Let's make a deal.

865
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,478
Your friends seem confused, Charlie.

866
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:05,921
You know the problem with murder?

867
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:07,911
It never lets go of you.

868
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,835
I should have told that to the Japs.

869
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,281
The Japs.

870
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:13,915
Take it easy, Jack, please.

871
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,753
You want me to talk
to your friends, the wolves?

872
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,998
They hunt in packs.

873
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:24,515
You go back and tell
the leader of your pack...

874
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,359
Signor D'Amato...

875
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,239
there's no deal with Jack McCann.

876
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:33,990
Look at you.

877
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,552
If your mothers could see you.

878
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,479
You can't touch me.

879
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:44,356
Goes for you, too, Charlie.

880
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:46,910
Not even you.

881
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,191
We'll see.

882
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,079
Jack, what's gonna happen to Luna Bay?

883
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,591
Jackass. Luna Bay stays right where it is.

884
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:56,715
Do you think my name on that stupid
piece of paper means you get it?

885
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,673
Nobody gets anything.

886
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:01,396
There's nothing I can give you,
leave you, or will you.

887
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,271
For years, people have been saying
to me, "Jack, you got to make a will.

888
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:06,239
"You got to make a will." No!

889
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:09,041
There is no last will
and testament for Jack McCann.

890
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,681
Where I come from, you don't own a thing.

891
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,798
Most you can do is stake your claim.

892
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,519
So you came, too.

893
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,280
I was looking for you.

894
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,879
It doesn't really matter now.

895
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,476
You can do better than that, partner!

896
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:28,113
Gee. Shit!

897
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,640
Come on!

898
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,117
Come on! You want a piece?

899
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:27,430
Come on!

900
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:29,518
Partners!

901
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:35,080
In Picardy

902
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,272
Come on, partners!

903
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:43,272
In the hush of the silver dew

904
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:45,159
It's not over till it's over!

905
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:55,359
Roses are flowering in Picardy

906
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:00,430
But there's never

907
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:05,589
A rose like you

908
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:13,959
And the roses will die

909
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:12,515
Burn! Burn!

910
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:21,631
Jack!

911
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,632
Wait there.

912
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,554
Hello. There's still no answer.

913
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,271
Hello?

914
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:01,237
I knew it would be you.

915
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,320
Do you want another one of the body?

916
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,199
No. Two more of the head.

917
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,358
Six feet, one and a half inches.

918
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:54,715
Ahoy there.

919
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:57,913
Ahoy, aboard Pandora!

920
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,350
In the name of His Majesty...

921
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:12,791
I arrest you, Claude Maillot Van Horn...

922
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:15,476
for the murder of Jack McCann.

923
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:26,915
Mother of God!

924
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:34,712
There's nothing left.

925
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:36,952
Nothing!

926
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:45,315
We were crazy.

927
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,636
The waste of it.

928
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:09,398
It was all such a long time ago.

929
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:24,515
Hello, miss.

930
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,475
This way, please.

931
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:29,315
Please, if you would, this way, please.

932
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:05,353
Oh, Papa.

933
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:11,155
Oh, Papa.

934
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,752
Where were you?

935
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:25,761
It's been over a week.

936
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,639
They wouldn't let me see you.

937
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:34,201
I don't know.
Some... legal reason or other.

938
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:41,990
But Worsley's a good man.

939
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:47,112
You can trust him.

940
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:52,794
Worsley may be on their side.

941
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:55,320
Why was I arrested?

942
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:00,115
They decided to arrest me.

943
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:05,435
I've been doing everything I can.

944
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,031
Are you?

945
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,754
Perhaps no one can help me.

946
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:14,315
I'm on my own now.

947
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,113
No, you're not.

948
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:21,632
You have me.

949
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,754
I love you!

950
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:32,118
Nothing's gonna change that.

951
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,081
Oh, Claude.

952
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:41,474
I saw him.

953
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:44,200
It was horrible.

954
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,600
I am a jinx.

955
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:03,515
Did you see Claude Maillot Van Horn
on the night of the murder?

956
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:05,957
I saw him in the hall.
He didn't speak to me.

957
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:07,435
But hadn't the defendant...

958
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:09,911
been barred from Eureka by Mr. McCann?

959
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,958
My Lord, I must object
to the witness being led.

960
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,755
My Lord, I'll put
the question another way.

961
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,710
Do you know whether or not...

962
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:21,475
the defendant had been barred from Eureka?

963
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,361
Definitely.

964
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:26,234
Jack would never have let him in.

965
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:28,874
The relationship between Mr. McCann...

966
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,351
and his son-in-law was strained.

967
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:34,155
They had had quite a few arguments.

968
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:36,358
Violent arguments?

969
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:38,671
Mr. McCann didn't like his son-in-law.

970
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:41,717
He wanted to like him
for the sake of his daughter...

971
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:46,034
but, well, the defendant's
a pretty difficult man to like.

972
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:47,800
Yes. Well, I don't think...

973
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:53,111
Did you see if he had anything
in his hand that night?

974
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,241
I don't remember.

975
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:57,398
You can't remember?

976
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:02,114
Did you make a statement to the police
within a few hours of the murder?

977
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:04,152
Yes.

978
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:07,911
My Lord, may the witness
refresh his memory...

979
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,230
by looking at his statement?

980
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,278
- My Lord, I...
- Yes.

981
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,195
Oh. Now I remember.

982
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:25,599
He had something in his hand.
I couldn't tell what it was.

983
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,400
Maybe a club.

984
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:44,152
What was your relationship
with Mr. McCann?

985
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:48,751
I was his best friend.

986
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:51,993
Why did you bring a gun with you
when you came to stay?

987
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,881
Mr. McCann was in a very
unhappy state of mind.

988
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:58,157
He asked me to stay with him...

989
01:39:58,230 --> 01:40:00,119
while his wife was away with his daughter.

990
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,556
I think maybe he was frightened
of his son-in-law.

991
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:05,877
You say you managed...

992
01:40:05,950 --> 01:40:10,717
to get to sleep during the storm
and did not wake up...

993
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,600
even during
the extremely violent murder...

994
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:16,879
of your best friend only two rooms away.

995
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:18,520
I had taken a sleeping pill.

996
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:22,720
You didn't visit Mr. McCann's
bedroom during the night?

997
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:23,632
I did not.

998
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:27,072
How is it that your gun was
found under Mr. McCann's bed?

999
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:32,432
I don't know how it got there.

1000
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:34,558
Obviously, somebody was
trying to incriminate me...

1001
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:39,956
but however poor Jack finally died...

1002
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:42,556
one thing is certain, Mr. Worsley...

1003
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,512
he wasn't shot.

1004
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:56,200
Do you know where your wife
was on the night of the murder?

1005
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,074
Yes.

1006
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:00,756
She was having dinner
with her friend and...

1007
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:04,161
Pierre de Valois...

1008
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:07,116
and...

1009
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:11,997
And whom?

1010
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,036
And Claude Maillot Van Horn.

1011
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:34,954
I'm not sure that this
is ethical, is it...

1012
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:39,477
subpoenaed witness dancing
with the wife of the accused?

1013
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:42,881
Come, Mr. D'Amato. You're a lawyer.

1014
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:44,520
What would you know about ethics?

1015
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:48,317
I mean, is it ethical...

1016
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:50,916
you resting your right hand
on my left buttock?

1017
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:55,557
Haven't you any idea
why I've been subpoenaed?

1018
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,791
I mean, I was in bed.

1019
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:02,199
Well, then, I wonder
why you've been subpoenaed.

1020
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,239
Oh, Claude.

1021
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:47,760
For whom were you acting...

1022
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,878
in the negotiations to purchase Luna Bay?

1023
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:52,521
A group of businessmen from Miami...

1024
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:55,480
who were introduced
to Mr. McCann by Mr. Perkins.

1025
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:58,514
The sum of money involved...

1026
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,560
was simply too large
a figure for any one man...

1027
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:02,995
especially at this time.

1028
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:05,720
Of course, you know there is a war on.

1029
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,241
So I've heard.

1030
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:09,550
What is your opinion of Mr. Perkins?

1031
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:11,479
My Lord, how can this be relevant?

1032
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:14,036
I think that Mr. Perkins...

1033
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:16,790
is a fine businessman...

1034
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:21,392
and an honourable man.

1035
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:26,471
What is your opinion of
Claude Maillot Van Horn?

1036
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:41,432
I felt that he was envious
of his wife's fortune...

1037
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:46,954
and that he made deliberately
derogatory remarks...

1038
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:48,759
concerning Mr. McCann's wealth.

1039
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,397
He said that Mr. McCann
had stolen the gold.

1040
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,911
No further questions, My Lord.

1041
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:14,877
Now, now, now.

1042
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:33,155
It doesn't look good, does it?

1043
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:37,041
Be patient. The tide will turn.

1044
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:40,274
Are you sure?

1045
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:44,116
Are you telling me everything?

1046
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:47,119
Everything I know.

1047
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:49,841
Are you telling me everything?

1048
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:51,071
What do you mean?

1049
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:54,040
My wife's a good dancer, isn't she?

1050
01:44:57,550 --> 01:45:01,441
You hear everything in jail.

1051
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,951
No. I don't drink anymore.

1052
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:10,880
Did you share your husband's
dislike of your son-in-law?

1053
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:12,435
Yes, I did.

1054
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:16,320
I thought of him as a fortune hunter
who'd struck it rich with our daughter.

1055
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,434
Well, he married her without telling us.

1056
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:24,517
Claude Maillot Van Horn is a very
persuasive man, is he not?

1057
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:26,951
Oh, women were fascinated by him.

1058
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:30,911
He had a hold over our daughter.

1059
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:32,836
Sometimes...

1060
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,436
we couldn't bear to watch it.

1061
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:37,591
He's not here.

1062
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,354
What happened to Stefano?

1063
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:42,877
Stefano's furlough is up.

1064
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:44,554
He had to go back to base.

1065
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:46,234
He went back to the war.

1066
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:47,795
Aurelio, listen.

1067
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:49,634
Be careful of the daughter.

1068
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:52,921
The daughter is often
more clever than the mother.

1069
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:56,274
Don't be taken in by her.

1070
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,640
You do what you have to do.

1071
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,554
"I will not tear myself apart...

1072
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:13,952
"because of your unrelenting
hostility towards us.

1073
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:17,034
"I don't want us to fight a war.

1074
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:20,396
"I want us all to live
together in peace...

1075
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:23,236
"but if that's not possible,
then I will find a place of peace...

1076
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,551
"within my heart with Claude.

1077
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:28,719
"Mother, I mean what I said.

1078
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:32,161
"I want to join you in Rhode Island.

1079
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:34,557
"Your most loving daughter, Tracy."

1080
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:40,361
That sounds like a letter
of love, Mrs. McCann...

1081
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:43,360
to be enthralled.

1082
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:52,074
Aren't lovers necessarily
under the spell of each other?

1083
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:06,636
Claude doesn't want to see you.

1084
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:07,836
He didn't say why.

1085
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:13,476
Well...

1086
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,358
would you give him
this book for me, please?

1087
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:22,074
It's OK.

1088
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,352
Thanks.

1089
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:36,792
My Lord, I regret to have
to inform Your Lordship...

1090
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:38,838
that at the request of our client...

1091
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,993
my learned junior and I
are withdrawing from the case...

1092
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:44,038
as the defendant wishes
to conduct his own defense.

1093
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:46,721
I understand the only evidence
he wishes to call...

1094
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:50,237
is that of his wife...
Tracy McCann Maillot Van Horn.

1095
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:08,600
It is generally believed
in this community...

1096
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:12,914
that your husband
married you for the money.

1097
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:14,875
Is that true?

1098
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:19,312
People believe that, yes, but then...

1099
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:22,472
Then what?

1100
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,239
Marriage is two people.

1101
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:30,194
I guess they're the only two people
who can ever understand it.

1102
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:37,479
Would you say your husband
is a violent man?

1103
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:41,636
My husband is no more
violent than anyone else.

1104
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:44,276
Didn't your father believe...

1105
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:47,752
that I had some kind
of demonic power over you...

1106
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:51,236
that I made you do things
you didn't want to do...

1107
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:55,430
for example, write this letter?

1108
01:48:58,150 --> 01:49:00,232
My father was a simple man.

1109
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:02,719
He loved me completely.

1110
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:06,751
I wanted to explain to him that...

1111
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:10,233
my love for you is more important to me...

1112
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:12,438
than anything.

1113
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:17,118
Even though this love
may have led to his death?

1114
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:21,877
Did I provoke the fight?

1115
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,678
You provoked each other as you always did.

1116
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:27,394
What about yourself?

1117
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,955
Didn't you provoke the fight, as well?

1118
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:33,271
You knew what would happen.

1119
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:35,114
You knew he would blame me.

1120
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:36,601
You knew there would be a fight.

1121
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:39,241
I didn't know anything.
It was just horrible.

1122
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:43,274
I loved my father before I loved you.

1123
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:45,432
Was he more violent than me?

1124
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:48,070
Stop asking me about violence.

1125
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:53,439
Your father was savagely murdered...

1126
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:56,241
beaten, his head cut off.

1127
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:59,473
I'm on trial for my life.

1128
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,439
If I'm found guilty,
they'll hang me by the neck.

1129
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:06,881
This isn't a time or place
to be shy about violence.

1130
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:11,271
Please, Tracy, tell them
who you think I am.

1131
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:21,755
When you look at me, what do you see?

1132
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:30,560
I see a...

1133
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:35,240
a man unbuttoning a new frock
for the first time...

1134
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:39,954
a man trying to get me tipsy
while he stays sober himself...

1135
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,754
because he's beginning to realise...

1136
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:44,231
I can hold a hell of a lot of liquor.

1137
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:47,593
I see a man with other women...

1138
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:51,311
secretive, dissatisfied with me...

1139
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:53,671
telling lies, small ones...

1140
01:50:53,750 --> 01:50:57,232
but needing me more than anything.

1141
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:00,194
I see a man who can't pass a mirror...

1142
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:01,920
without looking into it...

1143
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:05,511
a man whose face
hangs over mine at night...

1144
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:07,911
like a moon, a guide.

1145
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:11,112
I see a picture of love...

1146
01:51:11,950 --> 01:51:13,952
only you can't put it into a picture.

1147
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:17,159
It's... two people
in league with each other...

1148
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:18,391
who want each other...

1149
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:21,161
and are willing to kill or die for it.

1150
01:51:21,230 --> 01:51:22,914
Please, Tracy, for God's sake.

1151
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:25,078
No, for our sake, Claude.

1152
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:28,837
You want the truth?
That's what love is, isn't it?

1153
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:32,198
Truth? True love.

1154
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:35,278
True love is one that goes on and on.

1155
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:37,631
It never stops.

1156
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:41,112
Down and down in the water
till you're drowning.

1157
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:43,834
Then it's on the shore, on the sand...

1158
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:45,878
in the back of a car.

1159
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:49,880
Then it's on the bed.
It's an electric bed, isn't it?

1160
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,031
Like an electric chair.

1161
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:52,635
As you would say, it's switched on...

1162
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,833
till neither of us can stop it.

1163
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:58,681
Shouting and shuddering. Electric bed.

1164
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:02,675
On and on and on
until you think you're dead.

1165
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:05,715
Have I hurt you that much?

1166
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:08,071
The truth, Claude?

1167
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:09,271
Yes...

1168
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:11,432
about you and me...

1169
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:14,835
and Jack... and the gold.

1170
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:18,472
All right, then, Claude.

1171
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:20,518
Tell them how you killed my father.

1172
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,911
Go on, then. Tell them. How did you do it?

1173
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:25,601
This is all about death, isn't it?

1174
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:28,071
- We're talking about murder.
- Jack's murder.

1175
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:31,355
Are you sure it was murder?

1176
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:34,075
What are you talking about?

1177
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:41,155
Talking about what happened
to Jack McCann...

1178
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,001
on that day in the winter of 1925...

1179
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:47,311
when he found the gold.

1180
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:50,234
He'd been looking for fifteen years...

1181
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:55,274
day after day, week after week,
year after year...

1182
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,200
and then one day, he found it.

1183
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:02,678
How could he ever recapture
that moment of triumph?

1184
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,712
He couldn't share the gold.

1185
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:09,079
That was his and his alone.

1186
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:14,236
Now he realised that
his joy in having done...

1187
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:18,998
what he set out to do all alone was gone.

1188
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,960
Poor Jack.

1189
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:28,074
He was like a man struck by lightning...

1190
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:35,235
one moment of rapture
followed by decades of despair.

1191
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:38,796
Jack McCann wasn't
murdered three weeks ago...

1192
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:40,156
in his bedroom at Eureka.

1193
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:44,036
He died in 1925.

1194
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,716
What happened that night
was just his physical end.

1195
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:50,390
He needed someone to finish him off...

1196
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:53,713
and that night he found him,
just as he had found the gold.

1197
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:57,759
Are you saying it's some kind of suicide?

1198
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:59,677
That doesn't help me.

1199
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:03,440
They want a murderer.
They want it to be me.

1200
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:05,558
In a way, it doesn't matter
if you did it or not.

1201
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:07,911
Who knows? It doesn't make any difference.

1202
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:11,358
I'm the one who's on trial.
Are you forgetting that?

1203
01:54:14,710 --> 01:54:15,791
Did you cut off his head?

1204
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,594
No.

1205
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,957
When I found him, he was dying...

1206
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:33,354
burned, as if struck by lightning...

1207
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:35,834
covered in feathers.

1208
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,354
He was smiling at me.

1209
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,959
The next moment, he was dead.

1210
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:47,120
I saw myself in prison.

1211
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,793
I didn't feel sorry for him.

1212
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:54,194
I felt relief...

1213
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:56,715
but he'd never come between us again.

1214
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:58,480
Oh, but he has.

1215
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:03,116
Where does this leave our marriage?

1216
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,113
Behind our love, as it always was.

1217
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:09,353
I taught you everything you know.

1218
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,435
You mean about sex or about marriage?

1219
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:16,478
You meant about sex, didn't you?

1220
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:20,910
Do you think I'm guilty?

1221
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:22,714
Ohh, Claude...

1222
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:25,872
face the truth.

1223
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:30,678
You may have come close to murder
but you didn't do it.

1224
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,401
You're innocent, innocent.

1225
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:38,072
That's the only thing this jury
could condemn you of is innocence.

1226
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,481
You don't know who you were
when you married me.

1227
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:45,321
You don't know who I am.

1228
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:48,155
You were born under the sign of innocence.

1229
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:50,153
Your politics are innocent...

1230
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:52,153
the other girls...

1231
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:54,756
disappearance of your father,
the death of your mother.

1232
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:58,755
You are guilty of innocence.

1233
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,801
- What are you...
- Now I understand.

1234
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:09,154
If you had been... a man of God...

1235
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:11,954
if you'd been an artist...

1236
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:16,996
You fell into life, Claude.

1237
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:21,391
You stumbled and tripped,
but I picked you up.

1238
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:25,719
You think it was you who seduced me?

1239
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:29,113
It was just desire.

1240
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:31,995
What are you trying to do to me?

1241
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:33,919
Claude!

1242
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:37,790
You're doing it to yourself!
Don't you realise that?

1243
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:42,352
They don't understand you.

1244
01:56:43,190 --> 01:56:45,557
They won't understand you.

1245
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:47,712
They despise you...

1246
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:49,838
because you have me and they haven't...

1247
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:51,992
and I'm worth having.

1248
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:54,118
They despise me...

1249
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:57,831
because I'm Jack's daughter,
and I have too much...

1250
01:56:58,430 --> 01:57:01,434
and of course they still despise Jack...

1251
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:06,070
because he found what
they're all still looking for!

1252
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:09,035
I found you...

1253
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:15,271
but you haven't found what
you're looking for yet, Claude.

1254
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:19,721
Your time will come, though...

1255
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:21,280
sometime in the future...

1256
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:24,835
but it's not yet.

1257
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:30,795
You couldn't kill Jack McCann.

1258
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:34,516
You'll never kill anybody.

1259
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:37,031
Tracy, please, that's enough.

1260
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,561
No!

1261
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:40,837
You know what this man
said to me that night...

1262
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:42,440
after we made love?

1263
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:43,511
Can we stop now, please?

1264
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:47,271
- No! We can't stop now!
- I have no further questions.

1265
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:49,159
You said to me, "With you tonight...

1266
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:51,113
"I've reached the limit of my passion.

1267
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:54,114
- Thank you, Mrs. McCann.
- "There's no more of me to see."

1268
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:55,157
I have no further questions.

1269
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,681
Don't you want to hear?!

1270
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:59,750
My Lord, if the prosecution
wishes to cross-examine the witness...

1271
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,281
Claude.

1272
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:13,716
Mrs. Maillot Van Horn...

1273
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:16,598
it would appear from your testimony...

1274
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:19,674
that you were well aware
of your husband's infidelities.

1275
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:21,275
Now, this is a delicate subject...

1276
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:24,314
but can you explain to the court...

1277
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:27,394
why you seemed to tolerate them
with such grace?

1278
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,195
Or was it rather a pretense...

1279
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:33,274
one of your many attempts
to defend at all costs...

1280
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:34,840
the man you love?

1281
01:58:41,790 --> 01:58:43,235
I don't think so.

1282
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:50,191
It's just that I've screwed around, too.

1283
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:51,675
I'm a girl.

1284
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:56,640
If boys can be boys, surely girls can
be girls once in a while, can't they?

1285
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,672
In the police report...

1286
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,991
it states that
the defendant appeared to be...

1287
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,799
in the process of packing to leave...

1288
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:07,356
shortly before he was arrested.

1289
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:12,037
What do you make of that?

1290
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:24,198
- The war is over!
- The Germans have surrendered!

1291
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:26,039
The war is over!

1292
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:30,194
The war is over!

1293
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:51,755
"And now began a time...

1294
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:56,441
"dreamlike and delirious
of which I do not suppose...

1295
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:00,952
"that I shall ever recover
distinct recollection.

1296
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:04,278
Some things I can recall..."

1297
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:09,277
"as if we were here not long ago."

1298
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:34,197
All right. Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1299
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:36,476
The right decision, I think.

1300
02:00:40,190 --> 02:00:42,352
Is that the verdict of you all?

1301
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:43,272
It is.

1302
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:48,952
Silence!

1303
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:52,313
Silence in court! Silence!

1304
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:01,751
Claude Maillot Van Horn...

1305
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:12,673
the jury has found you not guilty
but the evidence has shown...

1306
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:16,431
that you are a man
with violent tendencies...

1307
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:19,514
and I am therefore going to recommend
to the proper authorities...

1308
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:22,161
that you be declared
a prohibited immigrant...

1309
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:25,234
and that you be deported from this island.

1310
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:28,312
You may be discharged.

1311
02:01:42,910 --> 02:01:44,799
There's gonna have to be some changes.

1312
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:48,671
Now there's gonna have to be some changes.

1313
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:00,351
Here's to us.

1314
02:02:02,590 --> 02:02:03,751
To us.

1315
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:15,838
This is splendid.

1316
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,234
I didn't know you could cook.

1317
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:21,601
There's a lot you don't know about me.

1318
02:02:24,030 --> 02:02:27,398
I feel... wonderful tonight.

1319
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:36,361
It's a bit chilly out here.

1320
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:39,241
Are you cold?

1321
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:47,359
I suppose I can now say
I nearly died in the war.

1322
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:57,440
I'm glad we said what we said in court.

1323
02:02:58,230 --> 02:02:59,994
It's more important to me than anything.

1324
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,473
More important than the verdict?

1325
02:03:08,990 --> 02:03:10,116
Well...

1326
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:12,716
You know...

1327
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:17,799
being deported may be
a blessing in disguise.

1328
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:24,196
Gives us a chance to start again.

1329
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:27,670
Where shall we go?

1330
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:30,275
You decide.

1331
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:32,637
The war is over. We can go anywhere.

1332
02:03:35,870 --> 02:03:36,996
Maybe back to France.

1333
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:43,441
We could see Gone With The Wind in Paris.

1334
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:52,196
God.

1335
02:03:54,150 --> 02:03:55,959
We can sell this place.

1336
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:59,517
I don't want to sell anything.

1337
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:03,275
You want to keep Eureka?

1338
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:18,559
I think I'm going to give it away.

1339
02:04:22,350 --> 02:04:24,512
The whole island...

1340
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:27,360
I'm gonna give it away.

1341
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:30,841
It's not what I want anymore.

1342
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,031
What do you want?

1343
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:36,953
I don't want to talk about it now.

1344
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:38,191
I've got plenty of time.

1345
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:45,356
Just want to...

1346
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:49,631
do unto others as I'd
have them do unto me.

1347
02:04:52,270 --> 02:04:54,079
I think it's going to rain.

1348
02:04:57,950 --> 02:04:59,998
It's the beginning of a good time.

1349
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:02,681
Let the good times roll.

1350
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:09,481
We're gonna have a damn good time.

1351
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:12,633
Hold that thought.

1352
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:17,953
It is pretty.

1353
02:05:27,590 --> 02:05:29,194
I'm sorry, Tracy. I...

1354
02:05:30,350 --> 02:05:31,795
It's the cold.

1355
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:35,277
I'll go and get something to keep warm.

1356
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:39,036
Don't be long, huh?

1357
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:40,236
No.

1358
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:30,873
I knew it would be you.

1359
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:47,351
Tracy.

1360
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:25,880
There's gold,
and it's haunting and haunting.

1361
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:28,436
It's luring me on as of old...

1362
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:31,120
and it isn't the gold that I'm wanting...

1363
02:07:31,190 --> 02:07:33,352
so much as just finding the gold.

1364
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:36,961
It's the great big, broad land
way up yonder.

1365
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:40,352
It's the forest where silence has lease.

1366
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:43,593
It's the beauty that
thrills me with wonder.

1367
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:46,799
It's the stillness
that fills me with peace.
