1
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Wait. Wait a second.

2
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,600
No class.
Oh, yeah?

3
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,620
I saved some for you,
that's class.

4
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,560
Did you spit in it?

5
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,590
No, I forgot.

6
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,640
Hey!
Where'd you get those batteries?

7
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,600
What batteries?
The ones that you're using.

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,570
I had 'em.
You didn't have 'em last night.

9
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,680
I found 'em.
You found 'em?

10
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,730
Yeah.
You found them right out of my Walkman,

11
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,630
that's where you found 'em.
Now give me those!

12
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,640
Don't break it.
If you ever come in my room again,

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,580
then I'm gonna cut off your feet.
No, you won't,

14
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,610
'cause then you would have to
carry me to school.

15
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,690
Don't try and find out.

16
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,740
Morning.
- Morning.

17
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,580
Can I get you
something, Bri?

18
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,680
Wet Willie!
- What's going on?

19
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,630
- Wait a minute!
- What you gonna do, huh?

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,610
You're gonna drink this,
pecker-head.

21
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,550
Booger brains.
Oh good, nice talk, very descriptive.

22
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,610
Stop it!
Or wear it!

23
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,680
Oh, cool it. Would you
guys get back in here?

24
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Animals.

25
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,650
Brian, you didn't
eat anything.

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,730
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

27
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,690
At least have
some milk, okay?

28
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,720
Uh, Brian, here, eat this on
the bus, at least.

29
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
You eat it for me.

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,740
Come on,
we're gonna be late.

31
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,600
You got it,
you got it.

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
- What's up, boys?
- How's it going?

33
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,630
Hey, Lee, the hell is
in your ear, Lee?

34
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,530
Oh, no,
did you do it?

35
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,650
Oh, my God!
Oh! Did it hurt?

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,530
Oh, no. No.
Did you get it in the right ear?

37
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,640
I hope.

38
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,570
Tasteful.
What did your folks say?

39
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,660
They were happy.
Happy?

40
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,700
Yeah, I told 'em
I wasn't getting a Mohawk.

41
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,630
Hey!
Hi!

42
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,650
I wouldn't be
seen with this...

43
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,690
Hey, you know
what my dad told me?

44
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,710
My dad said that
we're gonna have, like,

45
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,630
undercover cops
in every high school.

46
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,550
Oh, he should know, because he's
a doper, I guess?

47
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,530
Shut up!
Yo, I wonder who it is.

48
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,630
I was thinking
it was you.

49
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,630
Morning, class.

50
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,610
Hope all of you have had
a nice healthy breakfast

51
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,570
to fortify those
active little minds of yours.

52
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,730
Books under your seats, pens
and paper out for a little quiz.

53
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,550
Quiz?

54
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,650
Yesterday's assignment,
remember?

55
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,550
You said
it was optional.

56
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,720
Right, the assignment
was optional.

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,670
You didn't have to do it, but I didn't
say we wouldn't have a quiz, did I?

58
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,750
Well, you tricked us.
Yeah, I tricked you.

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,680
But it's not fair!

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,610
Big news, Jill, life isn't always
fair. That's part of the lesson.

61
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,630
Uh, this isn't
supposed to be life.

62
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,580
How are we supposed to
know what's what?

63
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,740
I mean, if you
don't tell us.

64
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,600
You wouldn't have to
worry about it, Beckman,

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,620
if you spent
as much time studying

66
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,530
as you do
stuffing your face.

67
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,530
Beckman.

68
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,680
Any other complaints?

69
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,760
Good.
Let's take the quiz.

70
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,710
It's good.

71
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,670
Stay low. Stay low.

72
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,650
Bend your back!
Bend your back!

73
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,550
Keep your hands
on that stick!

74
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,600
Keep it going, guys!
Keep that ball down.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Good scoop!
Good scoop!

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,590
That-a-way!
Play it out.

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,680
- All right!
- Good scrimmage.

78
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,690
Take your time.

79
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,670
Look up, Field,
there's an open man!

80
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,720
Come on!
Keep it moving!

81
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,690
That-a-way.
Good pass. Good pass.

82
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,530
Goal.
Nice shot.

83
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,610
Not good enough,
Why not?

84
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,700
Cause I wanna
see it in a game!

85
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,570
- Yeah, come on.
- Dude...

86
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,690
All right, food time.
Ooh, yeah.

87
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,530
Hey, so what happened?

88
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,730
Yeah, so, Melanie's sporting
a tube top, right?

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,660
And I go up to her,
and I'm like, "'Sup?"

90
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,610
And she's
looking right at it.

91
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,670
What?
Oh, give me a break.

92
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,630
The noodle,
the beef noodle.

93
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,630
The one-eyed snake
with a turtleneck.

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Yo, Brian, my man,
what's up?

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,560
Hey, sit a little closer,
huh, Brian?

96
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,540
Eleven-year-olds
into heavy metal!

97
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,620
They don't even know.
By the time they're our age,

98
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,710
they're gonna be biting
the heads off chickens

99
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,660
and listening to Barry Manilow.

100
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,640
Barry Manilow?
Will you explain that, please?

101
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,700
No, thank you.

102
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Oh, God,
they're closing in on us.

103
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,570
What do you want?
Get outta here.

104
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,670
Chocolate chippers.

105
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,550
Here.

106
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,550
Well, Jeffrey wants one.
Well, make him do a trick.

107
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,650
Yeah.

108
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,740
Make him speak.

109
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,550
Here, Jeffy.

110
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,540
Hey, can I have
a hand out here?

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,550
Hi.
Hi.

112
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,620
Hey, I thought we were going to
get your learner's permit.

113
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,550
Yeah, right.
You forgot?

114
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,700
Forgot?
I did not forget.

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,760
Oh?
Till I get mine.

116
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,700
My parents will never sleep again.
Hello.

117
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,630
Oh, looks like the Russian army
stopped by for lunch again today.

118
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,600
Glad I went to the store.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,700
Things got a little out of control.

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,580
Things got totally out of control.

121
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,670
Hey, let's go
if we're going, huh?

122
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,710
Oh, yeah.
Guys, I gotta split, okay?

123
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,740
Later, Chief.

124
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,640
All right, man.
Thanks a lot.

125
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,710
Bye, boys.

126
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,710
Bye.

127
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,600
So, where to?
Where are we going?

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,750
We'll go to your house.

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,630
Well, can I come?

130
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,620
Put on a clean shirt, huh?

131
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,760
Can Jeffrey come?
- No.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Guess not.

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,650
I can't believe it.

134
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,570
What's that?
What?

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,690
You!

136
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,640
When did you get so big
and good-looking?

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
And how'd you get
so smart, huh?

138
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,730
Not from me.

139
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,570
My God,
you're gonna be driving.

140
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,670
You're just gonna come home to
change your clothes and eat, huh?

141
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,550
I'm never gonna see you again.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,590
Don't get nostalgic on me.

143
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,600
Come here, hon.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,620
Come on, let's go.
Oh, too uptight to give your mom a hug, huh?

145
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,710
Who's uptight?
Are you too cool for this stuff? Is that it?

146
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,690
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm getting my hug.

147
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,590
Oh.
Oh, come on, Jake.

148
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,590
Listen, this is
the real stuff.

149
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,590
And don't you forget it.

150
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,570
Hmm.

151
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,660
If they're gonna be driving,
I'm moving to Idaho.

152
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,540
So, what if I just
wanna drive around the neighborhood?

153
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Well, you can't drive without
me in the car.

154
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,700
You can ride a motorcycle
with a learner's.

155
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,550
Oh, they're
too dangerous, honey.

156
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,690
Not a real big one,
just a dirt bike.

157
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,690
Well, we'll see.

158
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah, that means "no way."
Shut up.

159
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Hey...
Look, you're doing just fine.

160
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,620
Just take it easy, okay?

161
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,750
You take it easy.

162
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,740
Yeah, he drove all that summer;
Dad let him.

163
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,670
Colorful guy.
Yeah, and on the highway.

164
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,570
You little narc!
Hey, stop it, both of you!

165
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,650
Both hands
on the wheel!

166
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,600
All right. Look. Look.
Want me to drive this car?

167
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,650
Jake, you can drive!

168
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,670
Ta-da.
He can even drive with one hand.

169
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
I could ask him
to turn it up.

170
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,540
Ask him to turn it up,
maybe he'll turn it down.

171
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
Jake. Lisa.

172
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
Oh, Mom, look,
uh, one sec.

173
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,550
We just have to
put on our clothes.

174
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,650
Huh?
Jake!

175
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,700
Shh.

176
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,660
Very funny.

177
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,750
Dinner's ready.

178
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,540
Now, not too much parmesan
cheese on that, Bri.

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,530
How's your pasta, Jeffrey?
Good.

180
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,650
You're not eating?
No, I'm going out later.

181
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,720
With Russ?

182
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,620
Bri, I don't
go out with Russ anymore.

183
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,570
Come on, you know that.

184
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,650
People can
always change their minds.

185
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,690
Jake, I wish
it was that simple.

186
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,570
So, who are you
going out with?

187
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,750
Just some friends.

188
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,740
Oh, no, no, no, not all the
windows, just in there.

189
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,710
Okay, still extra $25.

190
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,700
Just for the front?
Great!

191
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,740
Hey, Bri, will you stop fooling
around and clean your room, please?

192
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,660
Your dad's coming in town.

193
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,700
He is, today?
Yup.

194
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,670
Here,
you want windows, okay?

195
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah, yeah,
that's okay.

196
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Yeah, he called this morning.
He sounded good!

197
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,540
Well, when's he getting in?

198
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,730
Hey, Dad's coming
to pick us up for dinner,

199
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,610
and then
he's going to Montreal.

200
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,700
Montreal?

201
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,750
Colorful guy.

202
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,630
Uh, Bri, that T-shirt,
that's what you're wearing?

203
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,600
You can't be serious.
He bought it for me. Dad likes Conan.

204
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,590
Not that much.

205
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,630
Oh, honey, please don't eat,

206
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,710
He's gonna wanna take us
someplace nice, you know?

207
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,560
Brian,
trust me on this.

208
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,680
And watch out
for your jacket.

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,530
And bring your shoes.

210
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,540
You look nice.

211
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,590
Dad!

212
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,580
Dad!
Bri, look at you,

213
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,730
you're growing like a weed.
Amazing.

214
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,550
How long you gonna stay?
Dad!

215
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,540
Just tonight.
Hey, Jake.

216
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,660
How you doing?
Great!

217
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,740
God, it's good
to see you guys.

218
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,710
I really missed you.
- It's good to see you.

219
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,570
Three months
is too long.

220
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,740
So, where are we going for dinner?
Wait and see.

221
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,750
Hi.
It's good to see you.

222
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,530
I wasn't sure this
was going to work,

223
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,530
but I had to
give it a try.

224
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,580
This will be quick,
but memorable.

225
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,600
When's your plane leave?
7:00 a.m.

226
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,630
Well, come on in.

227
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,550
Actually, uh, we better move it.
I made reservations.

228
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,760
But I want you to see the house.
Let's have a drink.

229
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,600
Joanne's at the hotel.

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
Joanne's here?

231
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
Oh.

232
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,600
She's going to Montreal?

233
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,650
Mmm-hmm.

234
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,620
Well, you better get going.
You guys ready?

235
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,600
Well, can Mom come with us?
Oh, no, I can't.

236
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,710
I made other plans, and I couldn't
break them, could I?

237
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,620
Go on. Go on.

238
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,660
Go ahead. Go ahead.

239
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,540
You guys go on ahead
for a minute, all right?

240
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,590
I wanna talk
to your mom. Okay?

241
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,590
Okay, let's go
get some chow.

242
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,620
Your mom seemed good.
Everything okay?

243
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,680
Everything?

244
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Everything at home,
you know what I mean.

245
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,690
Yeah, everything's okay.

246
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,650
Russ all over with?
Looks that way.

247
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,730
Is she going out?
Is she seeing anybody?

248
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,750
I think, yeah.

249
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,560
Maybe someone new.

250
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,600
Good. Good.

251
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,690
Uh, yeah, we're having
a Saturday scrimmage, right?

252
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm coming downfield,
and Brody, remember Brody,

253
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,650
the guy who can bench-press a house?
- Big bozo.

254
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,730
He comes out
and knocks me

255
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,610
right into the ground,

256
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm hurting,
I can't even breathe...

257
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,630
So how does your team look?
How are they gonna do this year?

258
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,690
Pretty good. Pretty good.
Springfield's our first game,

259
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,730
and I feel good about it.
I've never seen lacrosse.

260
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,560
I'd love to see you play.

261
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,570
Well, maybe...
Oh, hey, Dad.

262
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,760
If you're gonna get me
something up in Montreal,

263
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,610
you wanna know
what I want?

264
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,700
- Sure, what do you want?
- A sabre.

265
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,730
A sabre?
Yeah, a real one.

266
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,550
Could you get me
one up there?

267
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,660
What do you plan
to do with it?

268
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,580
He needs it to finish his lobster.

269
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,530
No, you know,
hang up on my wall.

270
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,630
Dad, if you get
him a sabre,

271
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,630
get me a suit of armor

272
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,560
Jake, Bri...

273
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,660
We got some
good news to share.

274
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,590
Joanne and I are
getting married.

275
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,560
When?

276
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,620
Next weekend.

277
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,600
Well, congratulations.

278
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,690
Remember, guys,
if you need me,

279
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,750
all you have to do
is pick up the phone.

280
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,560
Okay.

281
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,650
You should have seen me trying
to get that wine out of the house.

282
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,540
I had to walk
right past my mother,

283
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,620
and I had the bottle
underneath my jacket.

284
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,730
1968.

285
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,610
This wine is older
than we are.

286
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,740
Oh, my God, maybe that's
really good wine!

287
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,540
Well, it tastes pretty good.

288
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,700
No, I mean maybe
it's really expensive.

289
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,720
Look, if you have to,
you can always blame it on Julie.

290
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,750
That's the good thing
about having an older sister.

291
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.
Then, I would really get it.

292
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,590
Don't worry.
Why not?

293
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,560
'Cause you got other things
to worry about.

294
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh, yeah, like what?

295
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,650
Like that bear
standing right behind you.

296
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,670
I didn't spit in it.

297
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,750
Hey, come here.

298
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,620
What happened
to your hand?

299
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,600
I had to punch Max.

300
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,590
You had to?
Yeah.

301
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,670
I was trying to play handball,
and he kept kicking

302
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,590
the soccer ball
into the court.

303
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,570
So you punched him?
No.

304
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,610
I kicked his ball way behind
the handball court,

305
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,670
and when he went around
to get it,

306
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,630
I followed him,
then I punched him.

307
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,570
One of these days, you're
gonna get your ass kicked.

308
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,680
You realize that,
don't you?

309
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,700
Not by Max.

310
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,620
Oh, you must be one tough guy!
Tough enough.

311
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,710
Cocky enough.

312
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,600
Better watch out, badass.

313
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,650
Who is it?

314
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,730
I don't know.

315
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,670
Is it Russ?

316
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Hi.

317
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm Sam.

318
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Where's Mom?

319
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,760
Mom's, uh, sleeping.

320
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,620
Your mom's been
waiting to...

321
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,610
We wanted...
We wanted to...

322
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,650
Well, this is a kick.

323
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,730
This isn't the greatest way
to meet, is it?

324
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,670
I know one of you
is Jake, right?

325
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,750
I'm Jake.
Hi.

326
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm Adolph.

327
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,540
He's Brian.

328
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,610
Hi, Brian.

329
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,620
Sleep okay?

330
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,700
Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,730
Well, I gotta go to work.

332
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,760
Has your mother got...
coffee around here?

333
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Your bus.

334
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,750
Hey, space cadet.

335
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,540
Jake, has your mother
got any coffee?

336
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,630
Oh. No.

337
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,650
Um, she stopped using it.

338
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,540
It kept her up, you know.

339
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,660
Why don't you
try the herb tea?

340
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,540
Won't make you as jumpy.

341
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Thanks.

342
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,720
Hit it!
Hit one knee.

343
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,750
We got an epidemic
going around.

344
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,740
I gotta teach you bozos

345
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,550
the proper way to
dry yourselves after a shower.

346
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,540
First, dry your head.

347
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,750
Second, dry the crotch area.

348
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,600
You gotta be kidding me.
This is too weird.

349
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,540
This might be the most important
thing you learn in school, listen up.

350
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,700
Last, dry your feet and toes.

351
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,690
Head, crotch, feet.

352
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,600
Only in that order.
Got it?

353
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,670
Let me hear it.

354
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,610
Head, crotch, feet!

355
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,560
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it, listen to me.

356
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,740
When I was a kid, got a
bad case of athlete's foot.

357
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,660
It got infected.

358
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,750
One night
I woke up screaming.

359
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,650
The infection had spread from
my leg into my groin area,

360
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,650
and that's how
I lost one of my testicles.

361
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,760
Put it in
the showers, guys!

362
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,620
There's this incredibly
powerful connection.

363
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,590
Chemistry, whatever
you want to call it.

364
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,700
I knew it the minute
I met him.

365
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,570
In a lot of ways,
we're very much alike.

366
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,730
You know, I mean, we're totally
comfortable together.

367
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,650
We're like kids.
We have fun!

368
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,690
It's as if I've known him
all my life, this guy.

369
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,670
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

370
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,670
You haven't know this guy
all your life,

371
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,700
you just met him.

372
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,590
So what's your rush?
I mean, three weeks ago,

373
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,580
you were a basket case cause
Alan said he was getting married.

374
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,700
Well, yeah, that's right.
So why don't you be happy for me?

375
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,620
What is with you?

376
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,580
You know, Alan got his ice princess.
What am I supposed to do,

377
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,690
go into mourning
for a year?

378
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,760
Hey, I would hate to see
with someone on the rebound.

379
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,580
It's been two years
since Alan and I split up.

380
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,670
Let me be happy,
do you mind?

381
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,580
I'm tired of being alone.

382
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,730
I am not asking
you to be alone.

383
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,620
I'm just trying to suggest

384
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,670
that you please take a look
at what you're getting yourself into.

385
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,630
So he does not have
a law degree, so what?

386
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,590
He's a very nice guy.
He's solid,

387
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,660
he's full of life,
and he needs me.

388
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,590
And right now,
that's very important to me.

389
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,750
I don't wanna talk about this anymore, Pat.

390
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,690
The, uh... The way
we met wasn't so hot.

391
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,540
Was it?

392
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,720
So, how's school going?

393
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,590
I'll be right down.

394
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,750
How's work going?

395
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,680
Depends on the day.

396
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,760
What kind of work
do you do?

397
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,730
Oh, I'm in, uh,
security systems.

398
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,750
Right now,
selling and installing.

399
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,610
I used to have
my own company,

400
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:13,550
but, uh, big guys moved in
and squeezed me out.

401
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,600
And to help things along, I had a
partner who was stealing from me.

402
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,560
But there was just no way I
could compete with the big companies,

403
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
so now I'm working
for them.

404
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,760
Isn't it crazy?

405
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,600
And all they care
about is sales.

406
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,690
Man, I mean,
whatever it takes,

407
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,690
without any kind
of regard for, I mean...

408
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,600
I mean,
forget about the customer.

409
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,680
They don't care about that.

410
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,600
And I, for one,
find it a little bit difficult

411
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,570
to deal on that
kind of level.

412
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,610
So, I'm putting together
my own new company.

413
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,540
Very, very personalized,
very quality-oriented.

414
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,570
And with no partner
this time.

415
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,740
And I'm gonna beat Tri-State
at its own game.

416
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,650
Okay.

417
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,560
Okay?
Better than okay.

418
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,660
Uh, listen,
at Jeffrey's tonight,

419
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,530
so there's all kinds of stuff
in the freezer,

420
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,690
but you could just yourself a pizza.
Mom.

421
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,750
Yeah?
Don't worry.

422
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,730
Okay.
Goodnight, honey.

423
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,690
Take it slow, Jake.

424
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

425
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,740
Come on, maniac,
can we get out of here?

426
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Shh.

427
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,530
Come on, let's go.

428
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,530
Hey!

429
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,750
Hell of a shot, Bri.

430
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,570
It was an accident.

431
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,590
I didn't mean to.

432
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,580
I just wanted to see...

433
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,620
What would happen?

434
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,710
Yeah, sort of.

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,610
Well, you don't have to
do it again, okay?

436
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,560
Guess who's here.

437
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,710
- What do you think, Jake?
- Whoa.

438
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,760
It is Jake's?
Yup.

439
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,680
Here you go.
It is?

440
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,730
Uh-huh.

441
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Fantastic!
I don't believe it.

442
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,560
Sam talked me into it.

443
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,630
It's two years old, but
it's still in pretty good shape.

444
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,720
I picked it up from a friend
of mine I work with.

445
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,560
It's great! He even
polished it for you.

446
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,730
Yeah, but Mom
paid for it.

447
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,540
She did?

448
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,720
Thanks.
- Hop on.

449
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,530
No, no, Brian,
get off. Get off!

450
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,620
Mom!
Yeah, get off.

451
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,720
Come here. Come, Brian.

452
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,640
How's it feel?
Oh, incredible.

453
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,700
Okay, let me check you out
before you start.

454
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,750
You been on one of these
before, right?

455
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,670
Yeah. You got your
ignition here.

456
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,660
Foot crank. You give it a crank,
make sure it's in neutral.

457
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,530
Great.

458
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,750
Left-handed clutch.
Right-handed brake.

459
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,760
Okay, put it in gear,
let it out a little bit.

460
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,730
Easy, easy, easy.

461
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,630
Be careful!
No sweat.

462
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,730
Now, take it easy, Jake.
Just real easy now,

463
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,760
get the feel of it.

464
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,650
Remember, just lean into it,
lean into it.

465
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,610
There you go.
There you go.

466
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,680
Maybe Sam's okay.

467
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,740
He's an asshole.

468
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,630
Not a total asshole.

469
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,720
Close enough.

470
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,530
Why, 'cause you didn't
get a dirt bike?

471
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,670
'Cause I didn't get shit!

472
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,750
Hey, watch it!

473
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,680
Wait, wait,
forget this, do you?

474
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,700
What would I do
without you?

475
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,760
Forget the charcoal,
that's what.

476
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,600
Okay, gentlemen,
gather 'round here,

477
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,620
because the key, I say,

478
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,570
the key to great barbecuing
is right here in this bag.

479
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,560
Right, you need charcoal.

480
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
What is he, a wise guy?

481
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,580
This is mesquite.

482
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,630
Ever heard of it, cooking with mesquite?
No.

483
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,730
This stuff'll make your
tennis shoes taste good.

484
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,670
That great, huh?
Yeah, that great.

485
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,670
Here, take this off.

486
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,550
Okay, back off, Brian.

487
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,650
Okay, go ahead.

488
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,550
Yeah!
All right.

489
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,750
- Can I close it?
- Yeah.

490
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,560
Tell me when.

491
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,540
Good hands, Jake!

492
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,610
Wasn't expecting it.

493
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah, but you didn't back
away, that's good.

494
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,590
Didn't have time.

495
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,550
You going out
for the team?

496
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,690
Lacrosse,
I'm on the team.

497
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,670
Well, that's too bad,
we could've practiced together.

498
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,700
I used to play minor league ball
myself once,

499
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,550
about 100 years ago.

500
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,610
Really, who for?

501
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,760
Phillies farm team,
in Nebraska.

502
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,640
What position?

503
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Uh, second base,
anywhere they put me.

504
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,640
We did good, huh?
We sure did. Mmm.

505
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,730
You dudes should see
what we got for dessert.

506
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,550
Ketchup.

507
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,760
You got a smart, beautiful mother
who can whip up

508
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,620
an unbelievable
chocolate cream pie.

509
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,580
That was supposed
to be a surprise, huh?

510
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,700
You guys got it made.

511
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,640
I swear I love
this kind of grub.

512
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,600
Simple, but good.

513
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,560
One of these days...
I'm gonna open up

514
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,570
my own restaurant
just like this.

515
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,650
Tasty fish and meat
cooked right over mesquite.

516
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,650
What about your
security company?

517
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,570
Well, this is something your mother
and I could do together.

518
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,710
We cook
our own food, everything.

519
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,530
Main course

520
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,690
and outrageous desserts.
Hey!

521
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,580
Can't miss.
You should do it.

522
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,660
Ketchup?

523
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah.

524
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,590
Brian, you seen those
little off-road three-wheelers?

525
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,620
Yeah.

526
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,590
You don't even have to
ride one of those, do you?

527
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,580
Sam, should I
put coffee on now?

528
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
I'll talk to your mother,
see what I can do.

529
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,540
Yeah, absolutely.

530
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,660
Maybe for Christmas.

531
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,660
You're right,
he's an asshole.

532
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,560
Maybe we should
give him a break.

533
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,680
At least until Christmas.

534
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,730
You said he was okay.

535
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,550
He's an asshole
he's okay, okay?

536
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,720
Maybe he is okay,
the asshole.

537
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,580
You really think that?

538
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,670
How do you know
he's an asshole?

539
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,580
I just know.

540
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,720
Will you calm down?

541
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,540
He tries too hard.

542
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,680
So, what is
wrong with that?

543
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,720
I don't know.

544
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,630
He says
and maybe he's okay.

545
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,620
You know you wouldn't like
anybody she brought home.

546
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Hey.

547
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,660
You should get one of those.

548
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,550
Oh, right, sure.

549
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,660
I wouldn't wear that
in my own bedroom.

550
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,700
Melanie wears them.

551
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,640
Melanie's a sleaze.

552
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,540
She's not that bad.

553
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,590
Okay, so she's
a nice sleaze.

554
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,610
Maybe you could just
wear it in your room.

555
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,540
Mmm-hmm,
or in your room?

556
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,570
Good idea.
Forget it.

557
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,690
Hey, what about these?

558
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,710
No!

559
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,540
I hate their
dumb commercials.

560
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,660
Yeah, me, too.

561
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,750
Look, just get the kind you
always get. They look great on you.

562
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,560
Thank you.

563
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,600
I liked Russ.

564
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,650
Yeah, and look
what happened.

565
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,640
Maybe you shouldn't
make snap judgments.

566
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
Well, what about
trusting my instincts?

567
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,570
If she's happy,
what is your problem?

568
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,600
Trusting her instincts.

569
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,560
Oh, God, Jake, you sound
just like a parent.

570
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,760
- Jake! -That's the worst
thing you've ever said to me!

571
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,650
- Jake, what are you doing?
You take that back right now!

572
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,610
Or you're going home
just like that.

573
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,690
All right, let's go.

574
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,530
What?
Let's go.

575
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,620
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

576
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,700
What?
You know I'm right.

577
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Get in there.

578
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,620
All right, I forgot who
I was dealing with.

579
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,650
Yes, you definitely forgot.

580
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,700
Goodbye!

581
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,610
Yeah.

582
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,580
What do you say, Jake?
Not much.

583
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,610
What are you doing?

584
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,740
Well, I'm trying
to burglar-proof this place.

585
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm reinforcing this front door here;
putting in new locks.

586
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,740
Gonna alarm
all the windows,

587
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,670
then wire the whole thing up to
a first-rate security system.

588
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,740
- Is this stuff from your company?
- Uh-huh.

589
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,530
I want you guys
to feel safe.

590
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,610
With all the wackos
the streets today,

591
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,700
you can't afford
to be too careful.

592
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,740
The house
was robbed.

593
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,550
Yeah?

594
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,600
Well, I got stories
you don't wanna hear.

595
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Goddamn true life
nightmares.

596
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,640
Maybe you should tell them
to your customers.

597
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,750
Hi, Mom.

598
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,560
Hello, Jacob.

599
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,700
Sam's turning this place
into a fortress.

600
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,640
Can't be too careful.

601
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,550
What you making?

602
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,700
A cake.

603
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,590
A cake?
Mmm-hmm.

604
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,620
Mom's making a cake.

605
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,590
Mom's making a cake?

606
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,720
Yup.

607
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,530
Devil's food.
Another outrageous dessert.

608
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,550
What's it for?
It's for us.

609
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,710
Must be Sam's birthday.

610
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,720
Just make sure he gives us the
key to those locks.

611
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,730
Sam's gonna be
staying here for a while.

612
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
He is?

613
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,760
Mmm-hmm.

614
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,620
For how long?

615
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,680
He had to move out
of his apartment.

616
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,540
Apartments aren't
that easy to find.

617
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,680
You mean
he's moving in?

618
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,550
I knew the cake
meant trouble.

619
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,600
Look, you guys, I need
to have my own friends, don't I?

620
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,560
We'll be your friends.

621
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,670
Hey, Mom, what's going on?
Just tell us.

622
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,760
All right, okay.

623
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,680
Well...

624
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,640
This is what's happening.

625
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,610
It's been a while since Russ.

626
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,690
I met Sam, and I like him
a lot. I really do.

627
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,610
I like being around him,

628
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,690
so I want him to be
around here with us.

629
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,570
And I just want everyone to feel
comfortable about it.

630
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,650
Just like that?

631
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,640
We live here, too.
Don't we get any say?

632
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,610
Let me know
when it's time for dinner.

633
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,620
Brian, wait a second.

634
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,730
Jake, why won't you try?

635
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,630
It's too quick.

636
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,560
No, it isn't.

637
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,530
Sometimes it doesn't
take long to know.

638
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,690
Your dad's getting on with his
life; why can't I?

639
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,670
It's major.
Russ didn't even move in!

640
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,620
It's too important.

641
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,730
You'll have to trust me
on this, Jake.

642
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,700
Oh.

643
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,530
Oh, I'm just
gonna have to.

644
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,580
Yes.

645
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,640
Honey, it's change.
Things change.

646
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,680
Sometimes it's hard to accept.

647
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,580
But you have to try.
Please try.

648
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,760
Oh, you mean
go with the flow.

649
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,620
Jake, give it a chance.

650
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,590
What if I don't like
where it's going?

651
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,570
Well, you don't
always have a choice.

652
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,640
Things aren't always
about you, honey.

653
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,660
Right.

654
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,710
Jake. Please, for me.

655
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,580
Set it up.
Set the offense up.

656
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,760
Set it up.

657
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,560
Keep it moving.
Play it through!

658
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,760
Try and keep that stick
on the outside!

659
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,630
My fault! Play it out!

660
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,570
Cut it out, Livingston!

661
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,640
Save it for a game!
You all right?

662
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,560
Let's set it up!
You all right?

663
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,730
Yeah, I'm fine,
but watch it.

664
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,690
What's wrong?
I got another one.

665
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh.

666
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,590
Great. Nice going, Bri.

667
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,740
I didn't start
this one, I swear.

668
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,760
Yeah, I'll bet.

669
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,690
Oh, come on, just...
Please.

670
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,720
All right,
let me have it.

671
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,610
Oh, it looks perfect.

672
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,630
One more of these, and she's gonna
have to go in and meet with 'em.

673
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,720
We'll both be in deep shit.

674
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,530
But this one
wasn't my fault.

675
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,700
Why are you getting
in so many fights?

676
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,570
'Cause I always win.

677
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,760
It's like being the fastest gun.
Then lose once.

678
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Thanks.

679
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,740
Anybody got a chainsaw?

680
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,580
Takes a lot of nerve to call
this toilet a restaurant,

681
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,630
know what I mean?

682
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,570
There's nothing wrong with mine.
Mine's good.

683
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,640
And look at this, babe,
they're just packing 'em in.

684
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,530
Yep, you know why?

685
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,560
'Cause there's nothing else
around. That's why.

686
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,730
The sad thing is, people are
just waiting to be turned on.

687
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,760
I'm telling you,
we should do it.

688
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,650
We should really
do it, Wendy.

689
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,560
I mean it.
If you're really serious.

690
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,720
What, open a restaurant?

691
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,580
I'm dead serious.
Yeah.

692
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,660
Well, doesn't it take a lot of
money to open a restaurant?

693
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
No. Not if you open up
a sushi bar.

694
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,620
All you need is
some raw fish and a knife.

695
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,610
Let's do it. How...
How do we do it?

696
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,670
How do we get a loan?

697
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,550
That's tricky,
for a restaurant,

698
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,730
but there's other ways we can
put it together. I know we can.

699
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,700
Like what?

700
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,660
Well, we could
turn over some real estate.

701
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,580
Hell, I know some property
we could turn over.

702
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,540
It's only a little house
but it's on this beautiful

703
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,690
piece of land.
When did you see it?

704
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,660
It just went on the market
last week, it's perfect.

705
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,700
We'd fix it up.

706
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,610
I could do most
of the work myself.

707
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,620
I bet we could get in
for $10,000 down,

708
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,640
we'd turn it over
in five or six months.

709
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,730
We'd probably
triple our money.

710
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,560
And that's all
we have to do?

711
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,540
Bang! That's the down payment
on the restaurant.

712
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,710
It sounds like
we could really do it.

713
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,570
We could.
What if you can't sell the place?

714
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,540
Oh, I could sell it, Jake,
that's no problem.

715
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,690
They've been trying to sell the
house next door to us for over a year.

716
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,750
Well, not that house.

717
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,640
That just means
the market's soft, Jake,

718
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,590
and now's the time to get in.
Make sense?

719
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,730
What if it stays soft?

720
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,570
Jake, why are you so negative?
What's with you, Jake?

721
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,600
Why is everything such a
bummer with you, huh?

722
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,630
Well, all kids
are cynical today, you know.

723
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,670
It's hip.
- No, it's not.

724
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,720
Oh.
- Oh, it's not?

725
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,590
You tell us
what's hip, Jake.

726
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,600
Nothing's hip.

727
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,530
Oh, nothing's hip? You mean,
nothing matters anymore?

728
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,760
I didn't say that.
Well, what'd you say then?

729
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,550
You mean, nothingness is hip?
What'd you say?

730
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,710
"Hip" isn't hip anymore.

731
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,600
Sorry.

732
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,560
Now, Brian,
you have a spelling test.

733
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,590
I want you to study
for that right now.

734
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,710
Right now?
Right now.

735
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Hey.

736
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,610
Get off my back.

737
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,570
I had this really bugged out dream
about Rader's class...

738
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,710
Not again!
...last night.

739
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,720
Wait a minute,
where you're in class,

740
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,690
naked and totally unprepared?

741
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,530
No, this is the one where
everyone else was naked,

742
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,670
and I was the only one
who did the assignment.

743
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,750
Oh, you're very sick,
you know that.

744
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,690
Even sicker than I seem.
Yes.

745
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,710
Where are the cookies?
Hey, Jake, can I get a Coke?

746
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,710
I must have
the cookies.

747
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,570
Hey, Jake, how 'bout
a Heineken, huh?

748
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,590
Hey, guys.

749
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,650
Yo, let's get
outta here now, all right.

750
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,660
Why? Now?

751
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,550
Where we gonna go?

752
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,660
We're going to
your house, okay?

753
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,720
All we got is Melba Toast.

754
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,570
All right, all right,
all right.

755
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,720
Okay, let's go
Come on!

756
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,550
"And Rocky proves that
if you work hard,

757
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,710
"and believe in yourself,
and have the guts..."

758
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,630
Boring!

759
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,710
Boring alert!

760
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,570
Boring!

761
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,670
The assignment was major contributors
to the 20th Century."

762
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,550
Rocky's not even
a real person.

763
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,630
Yeah, I know, but...
You know,

764
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,560
I have been trying to figure
out what your problem is.

765
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,580
You believe in
the tooth fairy, too?

766
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,710
And did you forget
about Spider-Man?

767
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,720
Spider-Man
can beat up Rocky.

768
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,580
Superman can lick 'em all.

769
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,630
Sit down. Sit down.

770
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,750
Asshole.

771
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,590
Did I hear
what I think I heard?

772
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Someone have something
to say to me?

773
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,590
Jake?

774
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,640
Stay in your seats.

775
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,530
If you've got something to say,
stand up and say it.

776
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,760
Don't be a coward.

777
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,600
I didn't say anything.

778
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
Go!

779
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
Jake!

780
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,630
Your work isn't
good enough anymore

781
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,610
that you can afford to get
on my bad side.

782
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,570
Watch it.

783
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,740
Okay.

784
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,610
Hey.

785
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,700
Aw, nuts.

786
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,640
You wanna play
my records, ask.

787
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,610
I didn't think you'd mind,
they were lying out on your desk.

788
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:16,660
Where's my mom?

789
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,580
She went to pick up Brian.

790
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,620
You like the oldies, huh?
That's my time.

791
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,630
Your mother
give 'em to you?

792
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,540
My dad gave them to me,
and they're mine.

793
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,620
Yeah, I know
they're yours, Jake.

794
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,540
The pinball machine's
mine, Jake,

795
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,570
but you can play it
anytime you want.

796
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,550
Thanks, anyway.

797
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,700
What's the matter?
Lisa giving you a hard time?

798
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,590
Wait! -Brian, you look like you
been shot at and missed.

799
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,750
Wait!
Hey babe, what's wrong?

800
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,710
Oh, I said I was sorry,
what else do you want me to do?

801
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,630
Wendy?
You were two hours late!

802
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,730
Next time I'm not waiting!
What's going on?

803
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,550
Wendy?
Open this door!

804
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,630
Hey, there's a limit!

805
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,560
Come on, Bri, take me
off your shit list, honey.

806
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,590
I don't need
this shit.

807
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,670
You aren't
on my shit list.

808
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,670
Today you made the hall of fame.

809
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,710
Right, there's a limit.

810
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,570
What you mean by that?

811
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,540
Your brother.

812
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,750
"Went to Lake George."

813
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,690
Is that her writing?

814
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,660
Must have been in a hurry.

815
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,760
She didn't even leave a
number or anything.

816
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:16,720
Lake George.

817
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,760
Around three gulps.

818
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,660
Drink it, go ahead.

819
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,760
No, you drink it,
it tastes like rat piss.

820
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,630
Do you think they'll be
back in the morning?

821
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,670
Maybe I'll sleep at Jeffrey's.

822
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,530
No, not tonight.

823
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,540
His mom said I could
sleep over any time.

824
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,660
Well, some other time.

825
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,760
Why?

826
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,560
Because I asked you.

827
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,710
Aw, are you gonna be lonely?

828
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,620
No.

829
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,540
If you're gonna be lonely,
I'll stay home.

830
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,650
I'm not gonna be lonely!

831
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,720
Enough cookies.

832
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,570
I'll stay home anyway.

833
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,580
His mom makes anything
you want for breakfast.

834
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,610
Hi.

835
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,550
Hey.

836
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:47,690
Hey, do you wanna
come for dinner?

837
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,570
Tonight?
Yeah, I've already checked,

838
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,540
just come over
after practice.

839
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,530
I can't.
Oh, why not?

840
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,610
I... I gotta go home.

841
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,600
I gotta be there
I'm sorry.

842
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,570
All right.

843
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,730
Easy.

844
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,560
I'm waiting for Sam.

845
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,570
How... How did
Where's my mom?

846
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,710
Oh, she's out.

847
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,710
Sam went to get
some beers.

848
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,560
You're here alone?

849
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,760
Not since you got here.

850
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,650
What, are you a friend of
Sam's or something?

851
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,540
Are you?

852
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,630
How'd you get in?

853
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,700
Wrong house.

854
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,700
I thought I lived here.

855
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,620
Have fun in Lake George?

856
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,740
Yeah, it was
kind of spontaneous.

857
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,610
Yeah, kind of.

858
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,630
Don't you even
say hello?

859
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,600
Hey, come back here,
your hands are filthy.

860
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,590
Hey, Brian,
I'm talking to you!

861
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,650
Do you hear me?
Come back here!

862
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,600
Brian, open the door.

863
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,640
I said open this door,
right now!

864
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,610
Come on.

865
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,630
I met a friend
of yours today.

866
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,660
Oh, yeah?

867
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,670
Interesting guy.

868
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,610
What do you mean?

869
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,690
Interesting guy.

870
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,620
What do you mean,
interesting?

871
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,560
Interesting.

872
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,720
Yeah, you said that. Now you
wanna tell me what he said?

873
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,670
Nothing.

874
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,680
He asked me
something, though.

875
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,630
What?

876
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,660
If I was your friend.

877
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,730
He did?

878
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,530
Yeah, he did.

879
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,610
What did you say?

880
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,730
Nothing.

881
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,560
Why don't you just
spit it out, Jake?

882
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,710
You wanna tell me
what that means?

883
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,720
Do I have to?

884
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,700
Hey, shove it!
No, you shove it!

885
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,600
Come back here,
you little shithead!

886
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,530
Hey, don't talk
to Jake like that.

887
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,710
Now, wait a minute, you hear
what that bug said to me?

888
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,610
I don't care who he is!
Who are you?

889
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,710
Listen to that!
Why do you get out of here?

890
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,580
Oh, both of you...
I'm telling you now,

891
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,530
I'm not taking that kind of bullshit from you!
Hey, stop it,

892
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,570
both of you!
And you let him act like a shithead!

893
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,610
Well, you don't have
to act like one, too.

894
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,680
Hey, hey, he acts
like a shithead,

895
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,660
and you jump
all over my ass?

896
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,730
Christ, why don't you...

897
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,660
Why don't you go deal
with your goddamn son,

898
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,670
and get the hell off
of my back?

899
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,660
Hey, you're not
listening to me.

900
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,600
I'm telling you, I'm at the
end of my rope here.

901
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,620
These are kids!
They're kids!

902
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,560
You're not used to them,
you don't know.

903
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,690
Oh, I know, I know.
I'm not gonna takung any more crap around here.

904
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,620
I know that because
I got enough shit!

905
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,760
I'm knee-deep in it.
- Well, don't blame me!

906
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,580
It is not my fault!

907
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,660
Oh, what,
it's not your fault?

908
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,550
Do you think it's my fault?
You think I screwed up?

909
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,650
No!
I didn't say that!

910
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,720
Oh, yeah, you did,
you think I blew it.

911
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,560
Come on.
- No, I don't...

912
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,590
Listen, I don't give
a shit what you think!

913
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:37,680
You ungrateful bitch!

914
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,590
Hey! Don't you dare.
You lousy, ungrateful bitch!

915
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,710
Stop it!

916
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,740
Stop it!

917
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,670
Hi.

918
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,760
Hi, Jake.

919
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,540
How you feeling?
You all right?

920
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,630
I'm fine.

921
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,740
You sure you're okay?

922
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,670
Yes, yes, I'm okay!

923
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,710
Are you just gonna
take that from him?

924
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,680
How can you just take that from him?
Now, look...

925
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,660
What is going on?
Nothing.

926
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,760
He lost his temper, that's all.
He feels terrible.

927
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,650
He feels terrible?

928
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,660
Yes! Sam has feelings,
just like anybody else.

929
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,720
And he shows them.

930
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,560
Believe me, no one feels worse
than he does.

931
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
What about you?

932
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,560
What about me?

933
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:46,580
Look, we lost that property
the other day.

934
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,630
It fell through. Things just
haven't been easy.

935
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,530
He's really trying,
he is trying,

936
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:55,550
which is more than
I can say for you.

937
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,730
See, we're trying to do this
restaurant thing together.

938
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:00,600
I know it's something
it's something I can do.

939
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,720
It's for all of us.

940
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,730
I want this just as much as he does.
I don't believe any of it.

941
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,680
Well, you better
believe it, Jake.

942
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,550
Look, let yourself
get to know him.

943
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,620
I know him.

944
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,690
He's a deadbeat,
he's a loser,

945
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,700
and he's a bullshitter.
Hey.

946
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,730
No, he isn't.

947
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,680
Mom, why can't you see it?
You blind?

948
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,630
Hey, excuse me,
I am your mother.

949
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,530
You don't talk
to me that way.

950
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,650
Then act like it.

951
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,690
Jake.

952
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,540
Look.

953
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,740
I yelled at you,

954
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,580
and, uh,
I don't like yelling.

955
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,720
A lot of things are happening
for me right now.

956
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,670
Some big changes.

957
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,560
A few setbacks.

958
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,660
I'm feeling a lot of
pressure, Jake.

959
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,580
Sometimes I blow it.
I'm human, you know?

960
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,610
I never raised
a family before.

961
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,630
It takes some practice.

962
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,590
You don't know
about pressure yet.

963
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,700
You don't know about a lot of things,
but whether you believe it or not,

964
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,720
your mother and I are gonna
have that restaurant!

965
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,660
And it's gonna be a winner,
because I'm gonna make it happen!

966
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,710
Because I really
love your mother.

967
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,560
What do you think
I'm doing around here?

968
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,600
You think I'm just sitting
around here, huh?

969
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,680
I'm trying to do something
good for all of us, Jake.

970
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,700
I'm no loser,

971
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,730
and I'm no bullshitter,
either.

972
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,530
Next time you wanna
come in my room,

973
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,680
knock.

974
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,670
Next time you pass
judgment on me,

975
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:12,650
don't go whine to
chicken-shit wimp.

976
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,760
Have the balls to come
and say it to my face.

977
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,560
It's life.

978
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,560
Next.

979
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,550
Baby, baby, wake up.

980
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,640
She's... She's okay.

981
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,740
Fell asleep.

982
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,600
Is she drunk?

983
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,740
Come on.

984
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,730
Hey, listen, um, there's a party
at Betsy's on Saturday.

985
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,690
Oh, yeah?

986
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,620
Yeah! We're invited.

987
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,550
So, are we gonna go?

988
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,730
I don't know.

989
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:35,670
Maybe.
Maybe?

990
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,700
When do you think
you'll know?

991
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,750
I don't know!

992
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,570
Maybe I don't wanna go.

993
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,630
Well, great, am I supposed
to go by myself?

994
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,590
You asshole!

995
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,610
Hey.

996
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,630
It was an accident.

997
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,610
Hey, come on, Jake.
It was an accident, Jake.

998
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,670
It was an accident.

999
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,710
You're an accident.

1000
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,750
Will you stop it?

1001
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,660
Jesus! What's the matter
with you?

1002
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,690
Jake, will you stop?

1003
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,750
What are you doing?

1004
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,540
What is wrong with you?

1005
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,580
Great! Great!
Wonderful! Wonderful!

1006
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,530
I can't do this.

1007
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,560
Great!

1008
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,530
Goddamn, where's my nail file?

1009
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,650
The school called;
Brian beat up some kid.

1010
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,550
Oh, no.

1011
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,740
I gotta go
meet the principal.

1012
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:45,630
They won't let him
until I go down there!

1013
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,690
I gotta go meet
the goddamn principal.

1014
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,620
I don't need
this shit today.

1015
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,550
I know Mrs. Mercer.

1016
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,670
Come in.

1017
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,680
Jake.

1018
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,760
I asked to see
your mother.

1019
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,650
I've got to see her.

1020
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,740
She can't, she got sick.

1021
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,620
She's not coming?

1022
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:41,670
Would you let him come home
with me, Mrs. Mercer?

1023
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,730
Someone could've been
badly hurt this afternoon.

1024
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:45,540
I know.

1025
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,660
If this fighting continues, Brian's
going to have to stay at home.

1026
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,740
I don't know
what else we can do.

1027
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,530
Could you give him
another chance?

1028
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,680
Why is your brother
so quick to punch?

1029
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,560
Our mom's sick.

1030
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:10,760
Seriously ill?

1031
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,670
I don't know.

1032
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,560
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

1033
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,750
It's... It's been
very different for us.

1034
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:21,690
He won't do it again,
I promise.

1035
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:24,760
How can we be sure?

1036
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,670
Because I promise.

1037
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,610
Boy, are you lucky.

1038
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,650
What happens
if she's sick?

1039
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,740
I don't care.

1040
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,690
Everything I said
was true.

1041
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,760
Put that on.

1042
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,530
Think we could
live with Dad?

1043
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,570
Don't get your hopes up.

1044
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:51,680
Come on.

1045
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,560
You ready?
Yeah, go on. Ready.

1046
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,630
Brian!

1047
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,630
Your mother's crying right now
because you're screwing up.

1048
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,610
You're tearing her apart.
You satisfied with that, huh?

1049
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,760
Come back here,
I'm talking to you!

1050
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,700
Eat shit, dick-face,
you're not my father, okay?

1051
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,560
Come back here,
you little prick!

1052
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,590
You don't know...
Hey, leave him alone!

1053
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,650
Don't ever touch me
or my brother again.

1054
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,630
Is he coming back?

1055
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,760
Yes,
he's coming back.

1056
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,640
He just went away
on business.

1057
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Oh.

1058
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,560
You know, Jake, you and your brother
don't understand anything.

1059
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,700
Hello.

1060
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,660
Hi, it's Alan.
Oh, hi.

1061
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,530
How are you?

1062
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,720
I'm fine, are you okay?

1063
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,550
Yeah, I'm fine.

1064
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:24,710
Can I talk to Jake?

1065
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,550
Yeah, he's here,
just a second.

1066
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:30,670
Jake.

1067
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:36,690
It's your father.

1068
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Dad.
Hi, Jake.

1069
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,680
How's it going?

1070
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:49,630
Where you calling from?

1071
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,630
London.

1072
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,580
London?

1073
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,700
Got a new client here.

1074
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,560
Is Brian around?

1075
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,610
Uh, he's not here.

1076
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:01,620
I got a message
he called the office.

1077
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,560
Is everything all right?

1078
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,720
How long
you gonna be there?

1079
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,720
For the rest of the month.

1080
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,630
Do you know what he wanted?

1081
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,590
Probably just to say hi.

1082
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:17,740
Things okay with your mom?

1083
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,610
Fine.

1084
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,560
Maybe we'll all come
to London this summer.

1085
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,670
Sound good?

1086
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,610
Sounds good, Dad.

1087
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,630
Listen, I gotta go.

1088
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,690
You take care, okay?

1089
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,630
Tell Brian I called.

1090
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,560
Okay, I will.
Bye-bye.

1091
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,690
Bye-bye.

1092
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,650
See you tomorrow, Bri.

1093
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,660
You gotta take it home?
Yeah.

1094
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,560
Tastes like the box
when you take it home.

1095
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,690
No, no,
it's better here.

1096
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:38,640
Look, we could
go to Alaska.

1097
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,740
Are you crazy?
We'd freeze our asses.

1098
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,690
Look.

1099
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:47,750
I don't care where we go.
Let's just go.

1100
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,700
Just leave Mom?

1101
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,730
Yeah.

1102
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,720
She still cares about us.

1103
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,750
No.

1104
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,620
No, she doesn't.

1105
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,590
How do you know?

1106
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,690
Because I know how I feel.

1107
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,730
I'm sleeping
at Jeffrey's tonight.

1108
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,760
I made dinner.

1109
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,650
I made dinner for us.

1110
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:38,660
But then you didn't
come home.

1111
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,610
Brian called
from Jeffrey's.

1112
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,720
I didn't know.

1113
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,600
I made linguini.

1114
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,760
It's all stuck together.

1115
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,700
And chocolate chip cookies
with macadamia nuts.

1116
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,740
Your favorites.

1117
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,750
You want one?

1118
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,660
Come here, they turned out good.
They really did.

1119
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,700
Mmm.

1120
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,660
You're a coke-head,
aren't you?

1121
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,640
What?

1122
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,680
No.
Look at you.

1123
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,730
What?

1124
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,530
Look at the house.

1125
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,690
I can't be
everybody's maid.

1126
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,610
Look at your family.

1127
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,560
Brian. Look at what's
happening to us.

1128
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,660
Don't you care?

1129
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:32,550
Well, I can't be everything for
everybody, can I, honey?

1130
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,750
I can't do everything
for everybody.

1131
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,650
Is Sam your family?

1132
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,700
Don't put this off on him.

1133
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,530
Everything was fine
before he showed up.

1134
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,530
You might've been fine,

1135
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,670
but I wasn't fine.

1136
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,740
You're not fine.

1137
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,630
That's not you, Mom.

1138
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,530
You gotta do something,
for us.

1139
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,680
Please.

1140
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:08,700
What do you want
me to do?

1141
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:12,690
Get him out.

1142
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,730
No.

1143
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,690
I can't.

1144
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,630
I can't do that.

1145
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,710
You are late!

1146
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,710
Your research papers
are finally graded.

1147
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,690
Hmm.

1148
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:11,580
No excuse for the delay.

1149
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,560
I put it off
as long as I could.

1150
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,760
Then I kept falling asleep.

1151
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,700
What?

1152
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,670
What's this
supposed to mean?

1153
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:30,680
We can
discuss it after class.

1154
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,600
I didn't
plagiarize anything!

1155
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,630
Whatever you call it, you copied
key passages out of a reference book.

1156
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,610
I quoted!
I quoted what I used!

1157
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:38,730
You stole a lot more
than you quoted.

1158
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:40,760
I did not!
After class.

1159
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,540
You're wrong!

1160
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,730
Jake, I've got
the same book.

1161
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:53,560
If I'm wrong, we will
discuss it after class.

1162
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,650
Now sit down.
Let's get started.

1163
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:56,720
It's in the library,
I'm gonna go get it.

1164
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,620
Not now.
I can prove it.

1165
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,700
- Just sit down.
- Why can't I get the book?

1166
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:01,760
Jake!

1167
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,610
Either sit down,
or go to the VP's office.

1168
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:05,750
You don't want
the class to know.

1169
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,690
- Did you hear what I said?
- You wanna be the only one with the answers.

1170
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,650
You want us to think
you're the coolest, hippest...

1171
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,550
Go to the
Vice Principal's office.

1172
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,570
If you're that great, then why are you
trying so hard to impress us?

1173
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:14,680
Get out.

1174
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,600
You keep telling us
about the real world.

1175
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,690
You get out of my class!

1176
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:20,530
In the real world,
you'd be a grown man

1177
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,680
competing with a bunch
of 10th-graders!

1178
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,680
You're a lightweight.

1179
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,680
Lisa, stay in your seat!

1180
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,740
Where's the Peking duck?

1181
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,530
On the outside.
Outside?

1182
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,730
Peeking in.

1183
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,730
Hey, did you hear they're
opening a restaurant on the moon?

1184
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:04,570
Uh-huh. Great food
but no atmosphere.

1185
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,580
All right. All right.
Listen...

1186
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,530
Listen, listen, guys...

1187
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,680
I wanna say something
that's very important to me.

1188
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,730
Listen, I realize that
me moving in here

1189
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,570
and me living
with you guys has been

1190
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,740
a pretty rough adjustment
on all of us.

1191
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:26,540
But we're gonna bury this
thing right now.

1192
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,740
I mean it.

1193
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,750
We got a lot of great times
coming to us.

1194
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,760
All our plans are coming
together just like we wanted.

1195
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,610
Today is day one.

1196
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:40,620
Sounds good to me.

1197
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:41,640
What do you say?

1198
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,610
Sounds good.

1199
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,580
It does?

1200
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:56,560
Come on, Brian.

1201
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,700
Yeah, Bri.

1202
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,590
Yeah, okay.

1203
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,710
All right.

1204
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,760
You guys wanna
split a beer?

1205
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,590
Okay, good idea.

1206
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:11,560
Oh, I'll get it.

1207
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,740
No, no, I'll get it,
I'll get it.

1208
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,720
You expecting someone?
Yeah, yeah.

1209
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,620
Well, hurry up
before it gets cold.

1210
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,630
I'll only... it'll only
take a few seconds.

1211
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,710
Someone from Peking.

1212
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:22,690
You're early.
I gotta head back to New York.

1213
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,710
Okay. Uh, yeah,
go up the stairs.

1214
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,710
I know I ordered
Peking duck.

1215
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:32,650
He can be
so funny sometimes.

1216
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:33,650
Who is it?

1217
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,560
Uh...

1218
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,760
You know, he means it.

1219
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:44,740
He really wants things
to be good for all of us.

1220
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,760
If we could all just
give him a chance.

1221
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,720
Do we have to laugh
at his jokes?

1222
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,550
Wendy!

1223
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,740
Wendy, could you please
come up here?

1224
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,560
You're not serious?

1225
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,640
Who's that?

1226
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,660
Goddamn amateur.

1227
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,720
He never had it.

1228
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:19,760
Where the hell is it?
What did you do with it?

1229
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,590
What?

1230
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,620
Oh, don't give me that shit.
Now, where is it?

1231
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,680
I don't know!

1232
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1233
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:27,650
Oh, God damn it, what do
you think I'm talking about?

1234
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:28,730
What do you think I was
doing with the money?

1235
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,610
Now, come on,
you're not that dumb!

1236
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:31,690
Sam!

1237
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,610
Jesus Christ!
Where is it?

1238
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,530
- Hey, what're you doing?
- What'd he lose? His dick?

1239
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,690
Go. Out of the house.
- Sam!

1240
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,730
Oh, man. Oh, man!
Why?

1241
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:38,740
Just do it, now!

1242
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,610
Why, what's going on?

1243
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:41,680
- Just go!
- ...somewhere in this house!

1244
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,710
Why did you do this?

1245
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,530
It's got to be here.

1246
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:45,590
Christ! What the hell
- Sam!

1247
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:46,760
- Hey, wait don't!
- I'm gonna find it!

1248
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,550
Where is it?
What happened to it?

1249
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,530
Go away!

1250
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,590
I don't give a shit!

1251
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:56,740
It's here somewhere,
and I'm gonna find the stuff!

1252
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:59,650
Goddamn it,
happened to it?

1253
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,730
Where is it?

1254
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,570
Do you know what
I'm looking for?

1255
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,600
Yeah.

1256
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,530
You do?
Don't shit me.

1257
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:18,540
I know where it is, too.

1258
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,620
What am I looking for?

1259
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,760
It's not here.

1260
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,720
And if you don't get out
of our house,

1261
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,630
I'm gonna tell the police
where it is.

1262
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,700
The police?

1263
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,720
You're gonna call the police
you little shit for brains?

1264
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,570
What about your mother? You're
gonna call the police on your mother?

1265
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:35,620
No, Sam!
You wanna get your mother busted?

1266
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,740
Please, don't hurt him!
It's her money, asshole!

1267
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,710
$10,000!
That's conspiracy, pal!

1268
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:42,530
So, call the police!

1269
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,590
Go ahead, call them!
No!

1270
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:46,550
'Cause if I go down,
she's going down, too!

1271
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,620
Now, don't shit me!

1272
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,650
Oh, God.

1273
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,680
Tell him where it is.

1274
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,710
Oh, Jake.

1275
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,640
Just tell him
where it is, honey.

1276
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,560
I'll kick it out of you.

1277
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,630
No! No! No!

1278
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,670
Stay away...
Get out of my way!

1279
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,660
Leave him alone, Sam!
Where are you going?

1280
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:12,620
Sam!

1281
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,630
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1282
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,620
Son of a bitch!
Move it!

1283
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,570
Jesus. Are you okay?

1284
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:13,650
Yeah, yeah.

1285
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,530
Are you sure
My bike.

1286
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,650
My bike. My bike.
Don't worry about your bike.

1287
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:19,690
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Just help get my bike up.

1288
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:20,710
You're bleeding.

1289
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,540
Hey, wait a minute!
Come back!

1290
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:54,680
Hey!
What are you doing?

1291
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,680
Get outta there!

1292
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,650
Shit.

1293
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:18,760
Get out!

1294
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,680
I'll break your head off!
I'll break your head off!

1295
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,680
Open the door!

1296
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,600
There's you mother.

1297
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,680
You want me to
hurt your mother?

1298
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,670
I will, I swear
I'll hurt her. I, I...

1299
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,570
As much as I love her,
I'll hurt her!

1300
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:50,610
I'll do it,
You want me to do that?

1301
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:51,660
No. Ow!
Huh? Huh?

1302
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,530
Okay.
Okay, what?

1303
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:54,660
I'll show you where it is.
You're gonna show me where it is?

1304
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,610
You are? You promise?
- Open the door!

1305
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,540
Okay, get up.

1306
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,740
Sam!

1307
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,620
What's happening?

1308
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,650
Jake, you're bleeding.
Everything's all right.

1309
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:03,760
Everything's just
under control. Right?

1310
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,560
Yeah, Mom,
Where are you going?

1311
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,610
We're going away,
we'll be right back.

1312
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:08,620
I'm going with you!
No, you're not!

1313
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,650
Where are you
going with my son!

1314
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,570
Will you just let us
finish this thing?

1315
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:13,650
No!
Mom, just stay here!

1316
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:15,530
Jake.
It's gonna be all right.

1317
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,530
You just stay, okay?
Okay.

1318
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:18,640
Just stay here.

1319
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:40,700
You better pray to God
that stuff didn't get wet.

1320
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,600
Well, where is it, stud?

1321
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,680
I'm waiting.

1322
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,730
It's here.

1323
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:05,730
You better not be
pulling my chain, pal.

1324
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,690
If this is more
of your bullshit...

1325
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,630
Oh, come on!

1326
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,590
Okay, get up, get up!

1327
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:14,670
Get out of there.

1328
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,710
Okay, that's cool.

1329
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,640
That's good. Good.

1330
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,570
All right.

1331
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,650
That's good. All right.

1332
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:31,680
Everything's cool.

1333
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,560
Come on,
let's go home. Go.

1334
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:45,720
The only thing
we're trying to do here,

1335
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,620
is we're trying
to be a family.

1336
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:51,720
To help each other get
exactly what we need,

1337
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,580
and to go exactly
wherever we wanna go.

1338
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,540
What do you think, huh?
All about to me.

1339
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,730
Being strong enough
to handle whatever happens.

1340
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:04,680
No pain, no gain.

1341
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:08,560
No pain, no gain.

1342
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,720
One quick phone call,
to drop this stuff.

1343
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,640
Come on, let's go tell your mother
we got our restaurant.

1344
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:36,550
Wendy!

1345
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:38,580
What's going on?

1346
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:39,580
Get out!

1347
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:41,740
What? Wait a minute.

1348
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:43,660
Wait a minute...
No, I just want you to leave.

1349
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:45,690
Wendy, what are you
doing now?

1350
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:47,570
We got it, babe.
We... We finally got it,

1351
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:49,630
it's out in the car.
I don't want any part of that.

1352
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:50,740
I don't want you
around us anymore!

1353
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:52,730
I don't want you
around my sons!

1354
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:54,600
Come on, baby,
you're just tired.

1355
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,560
I am, too. Listen,
we should go to bed.

1356
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,610
Would... Would you leave us
alone for a minute?

1357
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,680
Sam, it's over.

1358
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,550
No, no, no.
No, don't say that.

1359
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,570
Get out!

1360
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:11,730
No.

1361
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,720
I'm not going anywhere.

1362
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,560
I'm staying right here
in this house.

1363
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,610
And that's the end of it,
you understand me?

1364
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,700
No, they don't
understand you.

1365
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:26,570
I'm telling you, get out!

1366
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,590
Oh, you're telling me?

1367
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:31,570
Oh!

1368
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:35,730
Now I'm telling you!

1369
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,720
I'm telling you,
I've had enough.

1370
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,590
You understand?
I'm not going anywhere.

1371
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:42,660
Get your hands off me!

1372
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:51,540
No! Sam, get off of him!

1373
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,690
Ow!

1374
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,650
Get out.

1375
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:25,740
You come back again
and I'll kill you.

1376
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,760
Get out.
