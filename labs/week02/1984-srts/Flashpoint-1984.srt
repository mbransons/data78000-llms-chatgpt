1
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,671
Come on, give me your hand!

2
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,116
not think he does, Bobby.

3
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:03,407
go, the good Lord will not let you die for
some tequila.

4
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,173
What is the number?

5
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,921
Lambasino birthday.

6
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,612
eight, thirty-one, forty-two
.

7
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,950
Bingo!

8
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,688
Well, well, we have here ..!

9
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:29,187
this fly anywhere,
partner. What do you want?

10
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,230
And this is?

11
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,382
Remember I said that someone stole
my razor?

12
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,631
Motherfucker!

13
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,410
should Lambasino arrest.

14
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,741
C'mon, Ernie.

15
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,102
Dress.
Not want you ass kicked

16
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,077
so early in the week.

17
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:55,588
I have eyes?

18
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,604
feet in the snow.

19
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,288
<i> what this is all about, </ i>

20
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,193
<i> is that in the last 2 years, </ i> </ p >

21
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:11,314
<i> Del Amo had the worst performance as a Border Patrol
throughout South Texas </ i>

22
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:15,283
Silence!

23
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,782
Frankly, gentlemen,

24
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,236
the attitude of this division,

25
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:20,799
stinks!

26
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,607
so bad that I have been asked to take steps

27
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:27,708
to improve the situation.

28
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,809
Mr. Lacy came from Washington DC

29
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,473
to teach a system that he has developed
.

30
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,307
His invention
help us all to achieve our goals.

31
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,145
Someone down those curtains.

32
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,063
Basically, it's a tracking system.

33
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,437
they see is a matrix representing an area

34
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,433
40 square miles
input is generated by geo-sensors

35
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:02,634
small electronic modules implanted in the ground,

36
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,001
sensitive to even the coins in a man's pocket.

37
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:09,486
do not even have a coin
's why crossing the border..

38
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:14,284
Enough
Wyatt.

39
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,283
Any next activity sensor,

40
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:21,159
generate a signal on the screen,
like this.

41
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,588
Here we see an imaginary immigrant
quadrant passing C5 to C6.

42
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,070
the ovulador regulated?

43
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,010
You're going .

44
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,086
what?

45
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:38,320
ovulador. As
prevents malfunction?

46
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:40,289
enough!

47
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,662
This signal is artificial, the geo-sensors
will be buried in their areas.

48
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,237
means we have to bury them?

49
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,392
Right.

50
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:57,546
Transmit a signal to the console when entering a
illegal.

51
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,822
sure to adjust the sensitivity for objects more than 60 cm.

52
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,221
Remember gentlemen.

53
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:10,493
sensor only detect objects more than 60 cm.

54
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:13,626
Sorry! I saw a rabbit in the field
7

55
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:17,282
big enough to jump
a pony.

56
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:22,936
Quiet please.

57
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:27,032
Just out of curiosity, how will these...

58
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,354
geo-sensors
affect us?

59
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:34,166
There will be fewer agents,
the taxpayer will pay less.

60
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,314
What he is saying is that after we bury
stuff,

61
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,134
two-thirds of us will
unemployed.

62
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,694
They tried this shit in Viet Nam

63
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,518
not work there, either they
work here.

64
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,347
Silence. Work in other sectors,
now follow the Master.

65
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,408
Open the curtains.

66
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,695
- I try to clarify something
- No you can not, Wyatt?.

67
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,195
just want to do one more question.

68
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:06,750
Let me try to understand,
third of us...

69
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,659
than fired,
sit in a room...

70
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,960
to monitor a machine that monitors
to another machine.

71
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,168
I did not go to the Border Patrol
to watch TV.

72
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,245
asked anyone about this?

73
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,100
Shut up!

74
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:21,112
Shut up, dammit!

75
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,356
Excuse me, sir, what Ernie is trying to say is that
might we have been asked.

76
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:30,164
entered the Patrol
to deal with computers and radar screens.

77
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:35,070
Many of us reject
promotions because we hate desktops.

78
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,880
think it's important to know what we want

79
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:43,188
because it seems that we have no alternative
.

80
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:48,596
Think I'm asking for your vote
This is an official decicisn.

81
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:54,051
And you're right, you have no alternative
.

82
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,819
Come on man, you
not believe this man, right?

83
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,251
Calm down, everything will be fine.

84
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,078
Hey, careful with my jeep.

85
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:09,202
Lombasino, do not fuck with me today, OK?

86
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,890
was joking, Ernie.

87
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,069
Carl, you say.

88
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,430
saw tire tracks in
forwarding Paseo. Pesqu?senlas.

89
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,385
something bother you, Ernie?

90
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,665
told you not to fuck with me, stupid.

91
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,410
Stupid.

92
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,330
You, cowboy, your locker seems
a drugstore

93
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,752
not mess, we are left with something
occasionally.

94
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:30,875
does anyone.

95
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,454
believe that if we deliver Brook
send it to the Central?

96
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:36,576
Amobls
home with things that we carry.

97
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,701
- is not that we are stealing, Bob
- What about my knife.?

98
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,359
That knife?

99
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:45,418
- Your
knife -. Oh, is your knife.

100
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,794
was lying for some time
Resentful.?

101
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,807
Fuck you...

102
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:58,058
Meanwhile, clean your locker or change
birthday.

103
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,243
- What's in the box
- Ask Brook?. Packet.

104
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,044
can not believe we boten
a damn computer.

105
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,904
will become of us after we bury
of those things?

106
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,869
never seen a computer that tracks
a man to 40 miles.

107
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,168
<i>  Unit 2 copies me </ i>

108
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,574
You're right, you have a good
education.

109
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:32,585
depend not work. But I... I...
I have two options:

110
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:33,986
Or lose my job, or...

111
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,975
. <i>  Unit 2 copies me </ i>

112
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,382
or spend my life in that damn basement

113
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,131
watching a fucking TV screen.

114
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:42,692
Shut up, Shut
damn radio!

115
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,755
<i> Yes, we are coming </ i>

118
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:55,095
Let's see those footprints found
Lombasino.

119
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,717
Tell me, Ernie.

120
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:14,478
, sometimes I have the feeling that all this
not bothered.

121
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,790
I hate more than you.

122
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,557
But I have more stamina
if you show me a way out, take it.

123
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:26,149
But as my dad
"If you can not get out, get."

124
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,709
I just said that if you can not fix
, send him to hell.

125
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,666
also said that.

126
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,327
do you think?

127
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:52,861
I have no idea
only tire tracks

128
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:57,202
No footprints. Or they flew
or are still inside.

129
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,732
llegales?

130
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:07,636
want me to call?

131
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,197
Brook believes we are in
Alliance Take a look..

132
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,742
No, no, okay
came to help..

133
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,555
We did scare shit!

134
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,946
Sorry, ma'am...

135
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,068
was time to appear
could have died..

136
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:24,821
Lucky spent here
Look at it this way..

137
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:28,260
Well, now that they're here, what?

138
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,032
We sell tickets to the dance
police?

139
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,362
Us Border Patrol
not have dances..

140
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:37,200
Hello!

141
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,973
Hello.

142
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:40,969
Count  why they are here.

143
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,373
damn car is fucked.

144
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,234
Mind if...

145
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,699
give out your ID?

146
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,793
Care, you will not run out of sight.

147
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,661
Look, we are honest people.

148
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:59,270
did the night shift. We are
telephone operators of San Antonio.

149
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:06,568
Wanted to shorten Durbin
way I am from there, but... we missed.

150
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:12,308
- And the damn car crapped
- Yes, yes, what you said before.

151
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,765
can fix it?

152
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:19,905
'll see what I can do.

153
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:28,435
Veras  you can do?

154
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,005
or retain the hell out?

155
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,410
Kidding
What is the problem?

156
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,528
fan belt cut.

157
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,586
fan beltcut

158
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,142
water pump blew.

159
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,026
water pump blew.

160
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:48,641
can take them to Del Amo
And then what.?

161
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,628
the workshop I will not sell them until tomorrow
parts.

162
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:57,416
- What you want
- The Grouchy?.

163
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,402

Up in Mesa Alliance. Without a doubt.

212
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,883
What happened?

213
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,154
According to the driver of the tanker truck
not respect the "Stop".

214
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:27,055
came very quickly, thought the other
would stop at the intersection.

215
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,509
broadsided and flipped.

216
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,894
tanker driver was taken to hospital
, the other died.

217
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:40,114
many were in the truck?

218
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:47,396
21 in total. 8 dead, 5, and
were removed. There are 13 wounded.

219
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,064
know who it belonged to?

220
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:55,638
name of that: Pedroza.

221
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:19,184
As you know, Sheriff Wells,

222
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,772
my client is not obliged to answer questions
yet.

223
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:26,273
In fact, Mr. Hinshaw is so unfortunate
of Texas law.

224
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:30,274
Since
truck belongs to his client, may I ask what you want.

225
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:35,230
Look, the truck is mine
But if you check the records,

226
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:38,634
see I reported it was stolen
my ranch several days.

227
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,277
Surely by whom he led
It is he who should be interrogated..

228
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:47,398
Only the Lord knows if that's true
The driver is dead..

229
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,128
How unfortunate for justice.

230
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,473
always goes with your lawyer?

231
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:58,125
That question is irrelevant, Sheriff
you I would not accusations..

232
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:01,347
Mr. Pedroza
is a respected man in the community, Mr. Pedroza...

233
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,648
Mr. Pedroza

234
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,860
is scum.

235
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,250

00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,654
not call me friend.

239
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:19,731
You appear here with that shit
attorney in your pocket

240
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:23,558
while his people removed
plastic bags.

241
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:26,840
that truck he was never stolen.

242
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:32,008
you collect "wetbacks"
in Chihuahua and brings them here.

243
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:36,591
He promises freedom and sells
death.

244
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:41,139
is a fucking murderer,
a bloody butcher.

245
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,988
- Your own people
- You have a dirty mouth, boy.

246
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:44,787
- Let
- You have a dirty job.

247
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:48,814
Come on.

248
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,144
okay?

249
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,892
I'm sick.

250
00:22:56,115 --> 00:23:00,424
trash Pedroza,
Brook and...

251
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,497
radarcitos.

252
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,378
Maybe  Brook is right.
We have no choice.

253
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,805
the fuck happened to you?

254
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:25,033
We have a choice. Output
remember we were talking about?

255
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,571
found.

256
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:44,213
seems
hit the wall and was buried.

257
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:49,749
And there was more rain and more mud
.

258
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,650
was covered for a while.

259
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,790
The lights were on,
driving at night.

260
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:03,007
- Wipers lit
- Yes

261
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,852
Change is in third.

262
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:17,129
quickly came to the desert
dark and raining..

263
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,745
Open it.

264
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:34,831
$ 800,000.

265
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,392
seems to come directly from the bank.

266
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,425
And if so why?

267
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:54,495
If this guy did something wrong and should be completely forgotten
.

268
00:24:57,152 --> 00:25:00,356
- has to be false
- Nonsense..

269
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,838
We took these and verified.

270
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:05,121
But they're good, I can smell Ernie
.

271
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,136
are you doing?

272
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,988
I want to see who this guy was.

273
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:21,361
-was a bad boy
mafia who wanted independence,

274
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:25,969
B-A
dealer who had a deal.

275
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,470
No respectable citizen would walk through the desert with all that cash.

276
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:48,678
A piece of paper with some phone numbers
.

277
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,379

281

Fishing rod, reel, rifle
crap for hunting and fishing..

00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,100
do you think?

287
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:57,034
is not right to take it.

288
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:03,537
Why not? For the rest of the world this
money disappeared 20 years ago.

289
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:07,292
Shit, Ernie! Not an hour ago, so

're the only man I know
ruining their own dreams.

299

Oh, Mariita... he says.
bet I'm going to brown.

306
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,185
Wait, I have a good one.

307
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:10,915
A guy goes into his car and a cop stops
.

308
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:15,601
- are you doing? Asks

309
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,991

310
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,965
guy looks back and the car is full of penguins
.

311
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,666

.

313
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,568

Now - now, the zoo?.

314
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:35,740
guy says: Okay Okay

315
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:41,372
The next day the police again
see the car.

you come here often?

323
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,955
wanted to spend the best time of your life?

324
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,284
is always so good?

325
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:19,920
Ernie sometimes vomits.

326
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:32,384
, Ernie is different. For starters,
is 15 years younger.

327
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:39,907
still believe in God, country,
at work, on duty.

328
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,714
is a man of integrity.

329
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:52,169
straight as an arrow
I no longer do so..

330
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,315
best man  Unit.

331
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,238
you?

332
00:30:56,862 --> 00:31:01,423
have good aim and
can direct traffic if necessary.

333
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,312
But I have what he has.

334
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:09,752
What is it?

335
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:17,224
That brave young
that can change things a notion.

336
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:28,479
If you do not believe that, because you still
Border Patrol?

337
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:31,745
likes. I like the freedom
's in it.

338
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,384
I like the fact that
Del Amo is so far away,

339
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,008
that nobody messes with us.

340
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,279
patrol sector is desirable that as little
anyone not interested

341
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,080
rules are twisted
keep us happy.

342
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,314
But it's nice to be in the desert
's beautiful.

343
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,330
attracts me the thrill of the chase
.

344
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:02,453
202 is the area code of DC
perhaps another San Antonio.

345
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,654
But both are disconnected.

346
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,489
Neither  card or social security...
Nothing.

347
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:12,898
If the guy was a thief, would walk with
more roles, whether false.

348
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:14,399
Or not?

349
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,600
is rare.

350
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:24,564
Even if they found the jeep,
could not trace the money to us.

351
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:26,619
We can.

352
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,793
We license the
home in San Antonio.

353
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,750
We're going to San Antonio tomorrow You
you trace the direction, money

354
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,728
Wait a minute.

355
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,600
These two girls work on the
phone company, right?

356
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,988
Why not ask them to
we check these numbers?

357
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,470
do not you ask him to Doris?

358
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,971
Who?

359
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:55,565
Doris, the sulky.

360
00:32:55,802 --> 00:33:00,426
could do that.
is so worn.

361
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:09,420
not know, do not know, do not know
Shit!

362
00:33:13,736 --> 00:33:15,684
think we should tell the Sheriff?

363
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,028
Is that what you want to do?

364
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:23,172
This is serious, Bobby.

365
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:28,961
$ 800,000 are serious.

366
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,239
Hey, you do...?

367
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,241
Buy Coins - Stamps

368
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,560
I help you?

369
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,627
Yes, perhaps you can tell me
this ticket.

370
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:06,471
won at poker last night I noticed
says "Silver Certificate",

371
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:09,757
Which generally says "Federal Reserve
". I thought it was fake.

372
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:12,451
who left the yard this?

373
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,176
There is nothing false in
Silver Certificate,

374
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:17,677
always it has been printed in the United States
.

375
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:23,131
You do not see many, the government stopped printing
in '62.

376
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,185
Let

377
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:32,287
Well  background, watermark,
good paper, signed S. Dillon.

378
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:34,888
.

379
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,315
good?

380
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,793
-
Insurance - That tells me this one.?

381
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:44,133
Bill Federal Reserve, '63,
series "Green Seal"

382
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:49,934
signing Devin Granahan, Series K,
printed ticket Dallas.

383
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:51,681
is also good.

384
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:53,367
sure?

385
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,337
If you can not tell a good one ticket
false

386
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:59,413
would not have lasted long in
this business, do not you think?

387
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,100
- Thanks
- back soon.

388
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:10,650
Satisfied
did I tell you?

389
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,410
has to be stolen.

390
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,809
type jeep
probably stole a Dallas bank.

391
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,312
what?

392
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,013
sound like an old woman.

393
00:35:27,902 --> 00:35:30,673
"Well, I dunno, maybe
not be right."

394
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,978
may not be correct.

395
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:35,407
At least not for me.

396
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:38,775
I did not ask
you talk me into this.

397
00:35:38,976 --> 00:35:42,612
Is that okay for me then?

398
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:49,867
'll tell you what:
unearth the money and turn it over to Brook.

399
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:52,416
may not punish you.

400
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:58,035
Look, I'm willing to take
money.

401
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:02,657
truth.

402
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,663
're so generous, Ernie.

403
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,208
Whenever we have the same right as any
.

404
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:15,652
Look, the guy said they stopped printing
Silver Certificate in 1962.

405
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:20,119
The other ticket is  '63, the same year the patent
Jeep.

406
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:24,414
Why not go to the library and we checked

407
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,512
if there was a theft or robbery
that year.

408
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:33,839
still need to verify that the type
home.

409
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:41,386
not find the house, leave me
library. Pick me up then.

410
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,472
luck?

411
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:45,572
A pair of armed robberies, guys
Frauds mail..

412
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,451
that you find out?

413
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:53,698
The house no longer exists. There is now a parking
.

414
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,146
the Patent Office does not have information
over 10 years.

415
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,547
So we're in the first month.

416
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,186
Let's go .
've had enough for today.

417
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,722
Will you take the money now?

418
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,135
You said 24 hours.

419
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,842
do not know if Ellen could track
those phone numbers.

420
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:17,959
Oh... shit!

421
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:21,552
plane.

422
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:22,820
That plane?

423
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,480
runway at Alliance
that we pesquisar.

424
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:28,695
are lies told to
Brook.

425
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,400
No, it is not
We have to go there tomorrow..

426
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,427
Who found?

427
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:33,453
I did.

428
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:35,361
You told Brook that had
found?

429
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,604
What would I do? Tell
I took the girls to the motel?

430
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,858
I told her I had found when I was looking
.

431
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,886
Tomorrow we have to find the fucking place.

432
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,826
There goes our day.

433
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:48,725
ahead.

434
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,092
Sherrif Wells,
Agent Logan.

435
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:56,451
, We met at Dos Gatos
Good to see you again.

436
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:01,500
Any relation to Matt Logan?

437
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,589
was my dad.

438
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,651
Motherfucker.

439
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,213
Let me show you something.

440
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:13,327
the top row.

441
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:17,942
3rd from the right is me
Who's with me?

442
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:19,843

443
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,385
! Have a seat.

444
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:27,455
Texas Rangers, son.

445
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,423
I, your father and the rest of us.

446
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:33,471
were the best he had.

447
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:37,763
now call
Department of Public Safety.

448
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:42,419
do you like a drink?

449
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:49,398
We have a report of a plane landing on
Alliance Mesa.

450
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:51,854
about 30 miles east of here.

451
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,609
son. Think I know where it is?

452
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,610
I know this better than
anyone except God territory.

453
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:59,911
And sometimes I wonder if not more.

454
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,413
Here.

455
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,524
changed.

456
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,890
Well, yes. We have a report of a plane landing on
Alliance.

457
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:17,854
done regularly. There is an old desert rat
, call Amarillo.

458
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,052
He has seen. And he complained that scares
his mule.

459
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:26,923
your father, God bless him.

460
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,372
better days.

461
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:58,243
Amarillo?

462
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:00,370
Who you ask?

463
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,509
He is  Wyatt is the agent I am the Logan
agent.

464
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,510
Border Patrol.

465
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,776
come from the office of Sheriff Wells.

466
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,867
says you have seen a plane landing at Alliance
Mesa.

467
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,520
then?

468
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:15,038
can download the old Sharps.

469
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:17,415
are the types of aircraft which
interest us.

470
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,845
you actually saw the plane land?

471
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,347
No.

472
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:26,295
But landings are regular.

473
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,946
Tuesdays and Fridays.

474
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:32,047
knows if you've never seen
the plane, sir?

475
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,330
a seismic fault,

476
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,841
top two officers crossing from north to northwest, short
.

477
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:51,683
flat side and clean
measured about 200 meters.

478
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,412
At 5:00
comes a Cessna 175,

479
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,745
to 60 knots, decelerated.

480
00:41:57,537 --> 00:42:00,891
Flaps down, rudder
down by the wind.

481
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:04,492
know it's a Cessna 175
As I know so much detail?

482
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:10,034
spent 40 years of my life being
Convair company engineer.

483
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:12,718
Convair know it, son?

484
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,391
Yes, sir.

485
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:16,779
plane scares my mule.

486
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:22,942
not be surprised if we
morning to see that plane.

487
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:25,976
assume that brings drugs from South.

488
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,440
Thank you very much.

489
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:31,627
Better be careful.

490
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,470
Desert Go away.

491
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:35,624
Why?

492
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,015
gonna rain.

493
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,045
Crazy old.

494
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:47,914
heard that.

495
00:42:58,652 --> 00:42:59,699
What is the problem?

496
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,851
No money trail
phones or license.

497
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,320
feel we should leave now..

498
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:13,138
arrest on a beautiful morning.

499
00:43:13,712 --> 00:43:18,115
Ok, make the arrest and as
finished, empty our closets

500
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:20,416
seek the money and go.

501
00:43:56,705 --> 00:43:57,893
Good morning, sir.

502
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,382
Wyatt and I are ready for the mission
Alliance.

503
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:04,859
I want to introduce you to the inspectors
Carson, Hawthorne and Skrunk.

504
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:08,279
These gentlemen
aircraft, Logan is responsible.

505
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:12,229
You receive orders
inspector Carson.

506
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:15,977
want a report on this
runway, Logan.

507
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:19,954
Called
Why is our arrest.

508
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:23,381
not issue credits, Logan, but
efficiency.

509
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:26,806
Our job is better if
interact with them.

510
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:30,381
addition, Washington has
interest in the matter.

511
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:35,393
this department owes favors Washington
enough, is not it?

512
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,083
I was teaching
our new tracker.

513
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:44,284
Carson
inspector is impressed with the sensors installed.

514
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:46,585
Good job, Wyatt.

515
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:50,470
We stayed at the Highland Tower, room 103
.

516
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:56,404
be a meeting at 9:30 o'clock
hope that report, Logan.

517
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:59,205
want to get the uniforms?

518
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:01,541
Yes, we will.

519
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:13,584
So
Brook men lead us into two groups.

520
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:17,978
A group from the west, establishing a perimeter
in this sector.

521
00:45:18,646 --> 00:45:22,477
The other group, from the east,
will handle this quadrant.

522
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:26,309
Wyatt will lead the group this
Logan and West group.

523
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,173
understood everything, Wyatt?

524
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,173
take all transmitters.

525
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:38,974
Our three vehicles and jeeps
are hidden at the foot of the plateau.

526
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,271
Here, here and here.

527
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,103
Where hide the rotating wheel?

528
00:45:44,586 --> 00:45:46,281
think this is a circus, Wyatt?

529
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:51,806
What he means is that in the desert
things are very visible.

530
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,307
especially from the air.

531
00:45:54,308 --> 00:45:58,008
Five vehicles
there probably will cast all away.

532
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,142
would you, Logan?

533
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,563
Half a dozen men
can handle the track.

534
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:08,164
Divide and attack the
plane has just landed.

535
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:09,965
I do not care  the plane.

536
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:14,071
Want the vehicle to take us contact
stash.

537
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:18,474
's just a deposit. Catch the
tickets and will be closer to the source.

538
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:23,088
Or you can let them do the deal, the vehicle
let go

539
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,189
stop the plane and follow the vehicle until the tank

540
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,290
have a full reservoir and source drugs if you are lucky.

541
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:37,485
Logan  Ok, have it your way.

542
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:53,518
All clear here.

543
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:16,774
Logan, Robert E.
Born 06/08/41.

544
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,651
graduate of West Point, 1963.

545
00:48:23,588 --> 00:48:28,238
Hero Green Beret in Vietnam,
3 Silver Stars,

546
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,739
recommendation for the Medal of Honor.

547
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:34,658
Had the world in the hands at 24.

548
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:43,812
And suddenly... poof
disappears.

549
00:48:45,399 --> 00:48:47,807
Nothing is known of him until '72.

550
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:52,316
doing now?

551
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:57,111
Sweating in the desert
top of a jeep,

552
00:48:57,112 --> 00:49:02,612
Saying "Yes, sir" to assholes like
Brook, who does not get to the heels.

553
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:08,393
That happened, Logan
Why wasting your life here?

554
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:13,585
I like quiet.

555
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,103
Bullshit, you fled
Why?

556
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,868
you do nothing
really valuable here.

557
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,529
Hell, when Nixon was president,

558
00:49:24,415 --> 00:49:27,949
had a "wetback"
working for San Clemente.

559
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:33,250
damn president had a "greasy"
cooking for him. It was in the papers.

560
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:36,524
someone cared
Hell, no.

561
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,190
I do my job, Carson.

562
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:43,255
No, you fled
Admit it..

563
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:48,581
- was afraid of being someone
- No, I was afraid to be someone like you

564
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:51,175
Hiding here, away from the pressure

565
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:55,427
pressure
politics..

566
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,941
Oh, come on, politics!

567
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,328
whole fucking country is politics!

568
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:04,139
you work in the Border Patrol.

569
00:50:04,994 --> 00:50:08,501
A Division of Immigration, which depends
Justice Department,

570
00:50:08,558 --> 00:50:12,836
reporting directly to the Congress.
is believed that this is not political?

571
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:16,522
eludes you think
system because it hides in the background.

572
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:20,113
not work for the system to work
law.

573
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:26,132
law, by God! You work for the same law
paying our salaries.

574
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,519
The law of supply and demand.

575
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:35,352
Think, smart guy. His work depends
of those "wetbacks"

576
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:38,829
if not exist, would invent

577
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:43,800
If not, as would justify the millions we
provides Congress every year?

578
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:53,805
's the American way, friend
Supply and demand..

579
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:57,406
if supply is missing, create it.

580
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:08,441
Every day I wake up I thank
drugs, murder, subversion.

581
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:15,328
Because without them, we would all be out of work
.

582
00:51:18,277 --> 00:51:19,513
Who are you?

583
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:26,293
Not a Federal
more behind a drug arrest.

584
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,726
are you doing here, really?

585
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,936
am a repairman, Logan
fix things..

586
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:37,128
Yes? What kind of things?

587
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:44,082
that need fixing.

588
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:49,071
<i> We have visual contact with an approaching van
Plateau </ i>

589
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:53,668
Copying Ernie

ready, Bobby.

593
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:06,548
I'm going out.

594
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:08,560
Let

595
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,579
Stop! Stop the plane.

596
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:03,484
Ernie, jump!

597
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,881
Ernie... dammit!

598
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:23,640
jumped the fuck not?

599
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:25,751
you told them.

600
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,628
warned them to escape,
motherfucker!

601
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,609
Is that what is here
killed Ernie, damn it.

602
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:37,124
I shot the plane, Logan.

603
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,496
These are my witnesses
What are yours, asshole.?

604
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:04,135
knew that bastard was not
here for a drug arrest.

605
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:08,592
the trouble to send
dressed that Washington is not taken.

606
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:14,299
He was sent to protect the source from there
Someone spoke of fucking money..

607
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:20,567
They are shitting.
Take the money and go to Mexico.

608
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,025
What is this?

609
00:56:23,361 --> 00:56:24,859
tea.

610
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,161
Who is it?

611
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,237
's us, Ellen and Doris.

612
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:40,324
We told
be here or in the hospital.

613
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,373
you okay?

614
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:46,308
with a little cold.

615
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:50,518
hope it's okay to come unannounced.

616
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,407
sure were lucky to find us.

617
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:59,772
We leave tomorrow. We now
vacation or lose. Beer?

618
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:03,225
Well, where will they go?

619
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,544
Mexico

620
00:57:05,177 --> 00:57:07,347
Ernie, do not invite me for a drink?

621
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:09,192
Make that 2 beers, Bobby.

622
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:13,335
Tracked those two numbers left a note in his office.

623
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:15,229
What?

624
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:20,977
numbers. One of them belongs to a certain
Beck in Washington DC

625
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:25,178
And the other was Dallas police
20 years.

626
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,474
left that information to someone
office.?

627
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:35,206
Price  friend who was in the bar.
What is the name...? Lamba...

628
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:36,223
Lambasino.

629
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:37,292
, that one.

630
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:40,025
We left the note said that the
deliver tomorrow.

631
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:43,726
would have brought here, but
not know if would be home.

632
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:47,767
tried to call last night, as nobody answered
, worried. So...

633
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:53,588
went to the office. The chief said
were on a mission.

634
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,630
were a lot of people where you work.

635
00:57:56,929 --> 00:58:02,551
Lamborgino was happy because a Federal
carrada found a cocaine

636
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:05,363
even brought a corpse.

637
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:06,957
was nothing but a skeleton.

638
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:09,160
skeleton?

639
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:14,079
All were very agitated
told us to leave.

640
00:58:17,095 --> 00:58:20,978
- I go to the bathroom
- Yeah, sure?.

641
00:58:27,596 --> 00:58:32,672
I have to talk to Ernie
right back..

642
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:52,371
are up to the neck, man.

643
00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:55,237
Nobody knows where those numbers came
.

644
00:59:10,998 --> 00:59:13,333

654
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,138
Listen, I like you,

656
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,002
But I can not take you with me now.

657

And what if I did?

663
01:01:20,066 --> 01:01:23,055
I did not take anything
There was nothing to take.

664
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:26,143
Who the hell are you?

665
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:41,257
- Max, Lambasino left a note
- Maybe you are on the Board?.

667
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,985

668
01:01:46,575 --> 01:01:49,081
Who knows

669
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:50,882

Washington will decide during the next month.

676
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:06,969
Meanwhile, Carson
interim head freezes.

677
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:10,101

678

692
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:26,176
you have no idea what your peers are searching
there?

693
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:29,597
Ask
people who are in charge.

694
01:03:31,462 --> 01:03:37,805
Not the kind of people who would ask me
. Thank you.

695
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:42,154
suits are men of Carson.

696
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:44,546
.

697
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:48,574
Hey, watch this.

698
01:03:57,898 --> 01:03:59,506
A man wearing a horse.

699
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:02,207
Or a mule.

700
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,778
We should have heard this
Someone should have seen reported..

701
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:14,033
Look, here and here.

702
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:20,201
Two men, street shoes.

703
01:04:21,012 --> 01:04:25,385
This here

704
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:30,747
18 x 40, standard heavy duty
Trocha..

705
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:32,810
Probably  a jeep.

706
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,583
Lambasino and Roget?

707
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:46,468
city vehicle, standard gauge,
misaligned front end.

708
01:04:52,153 --> 01:04:53,341
now?

709
01:04:55,607 --> 01:04:58,514
tracked each State Auto Texas
need alignment?

710
01:04:59,284 --> 01:05:01,636
seems Lambasino and Roget
followed.

711
01:05:02,837 --> 01:05:04,637
No report this?

712
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:13,249
Bobby, I did all the road with the radio on
.

713
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:15,551
Nothing!

714
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:21,743
What's with that jeep that brought Carson
the 5th Army up here?

715
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:25,944
Why  driver only brought
a driver's license?

716
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,401
Where did all that money?

717
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:34,202
is the only man who reported this
is there, dead?

718
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:37,867
Why Lambasino and Roget
not reported?

719
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:39,307
Where is the city car?

720
01:06:42,743 --> 01:06:45,908
seems that came and went.

721
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:20,819
So you found the footprints
coming over here, right?

722
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:26,202
Auto City

01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,732
a still from the old

724
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:32,333
They killed him and burned his house.

725
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:34,421
Lambasino and Roget were there.

726
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:38,315
followed that car. Traces of both
brought us here.

727
01:10:39,386 --> 01:10:40,886
So that's your story?

728
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:45,073
Because "history" says?

729
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:48,000
chasing  know, right?

730
01:10:49,406 --> 01:10:51,760

We were informed that Mr. Pedroza
sends a shipment of illegal.

739
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:30,062
Apparently  cross by

and detect a car near Soledad Mountain
.

No sir, it's the chance to grab
Pedroza.

746
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:16,710
Fuck Pedroza and the car should go
hell now.

747
01:12:17,822 --> 01:12:19,015
can not do it, Bobby.

748
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:58,669
Special Unit 2. In Soledad Mountain

749
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:02,294

Who the hell is that?

Why?

768
01:21:42,195 --> 01:21:44,283
Fuck you, man.

769

Who were you?

772
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:22,519
Let me see your hands, please.

773
01:23:28,716 --> 01:23:31,389
Why dug where they should not?

rifle did.

775
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:41,123
I got a license number
and said...

776
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:45,912
Curtis would appear that such a
in the afternoon or evening of 22.

777
01:23:46,113 --> 01:23:48,013
"Go get him, wait"

778
01:23:49,652 --> 01:23:56,192
had to give him money and a fishing kit
place for rifle.

779

Guide you to the border...
did what I was told.

780
01:24:02,566 --> 01:24:07,866
But out of nowhere, you gave him the license number

781
01:24:08,067 --> 01:24:10,167
and the nightmare began again.
