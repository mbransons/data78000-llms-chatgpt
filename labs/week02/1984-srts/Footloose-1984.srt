1
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:38,736
I gotta cut loose, footloose

2
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,673
Kick off your Sunday shoes

3
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,609
Please, Louise

4
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,443
Pull me off of my knees

5
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,040
Jack, get back

6
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,984
C'mon before we crack

7
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,750
Lose your blues

8
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,451
Everybody cut footloose

9
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,166
You're playin'so cool

10
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,759
Obeying every rule

11
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,669
Dig way down in your heart

12
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,207
You're burning, yearning for some

13
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,335
Somebody to tell you

14
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,505
That life ain't passing you by

15
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,814
I'm trying to tell you

16
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:30,824
It will if you don't even try

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,721
You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose

18
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,459
Kick off your Sunday shoes

19
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,331
Oowhee, Marie

20
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,236
Shake it, shake it for me

21
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,968
Whoa, Milo

22
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,875
C'mon, c'mon let go

23
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,675
Lose your blues

24
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,682
Everybody cut footloose

25
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:09,822
You got to turn it around

26
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,922
And put your feet on the ground

27
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,765
Now take ahold of your soul

28
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,038
I'm turning it loose
Footloose

29
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:40,644
And he is testing us.

30
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:45,582
Every, every day,
our Lord is testing us.

31
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,643
If he wasn't testing us...

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,881
how would you account...

33
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,823
for the sorry state
of our society...

34
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,793
for the crimes...

35
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:59,229
that plague the big cities
of this country...

36
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,066
when he could sweep this pestilence
from the face of the earth...

37
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,038
with one mighty gesture of his hand?

38
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:11,535
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
how would you account...

39
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,545
for the proliferation these days...

40
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:17,640
of this obscene
rock and roll music...

41
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:22,017
with its gospel of easy sexuality...

42
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,056
and relaxed morality?

43
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:28,656
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
why, he could take all...

44
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:32,858
these pornographic books
and albums...

45
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:37,028
and turn them into one big
fiery cinder like that!

46
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:41,836
But how would that make us
stronger for him?

47
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:50,273
One of these days,
my Lord is going to come to me...

48
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,750
and ask me for an explanation...

49
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,118
for the lives of each
and every one of you.

50
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:00,522
What am I going to tell him
on that day?

51
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:05,755
That I was busy?
That I was tired?

52
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,633
That I was bored?

53
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,499
No! I can never let up!

54
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,506
I welcome his test.

55
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,565
I welcome this challenge
from my Lord...

56
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:20,409
so that one day I can deliver
all of you unto his hands.

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,880
And when that day dawns...

58
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,816
I don't want to have
to do any explaining!

59
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:29,616
I don't want to be missing...

60
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,714
from your lives!

61
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,419
Praise the Lord in singing...

62
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,725
hymn number 39 7...

63
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:41,597
''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.''

64
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:47,338
What a friend

65
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:52,276
We have in Jesus

66
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:58,250
All our sins and grief to bear

67
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,583
I will. You have
a good week now. Bye.

68
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:05,715
Mrs. MacCormack, your sister
has us so excited about you coming.

69
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,158
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?

70
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:11,458
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.

71
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,999
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.

72
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,865
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?

73
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:20,030
Ariel, will you come
and meet the MacCormacks?

74
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,040
The stunning new gentleman.

75
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,544
This is Mrs. MacCormack
and her son. Is it Ren?

76
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:32,113
Ren's going to be new
at the high school tomorrow.

77
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:38,388
Me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty are
going for a soda at the Hi-Spot.

78
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,484
Ariel, remember
you have school tomorrow.

79
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,155
I'll be home for supper.

80
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,562
God, is he excellent!

81
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,725
What, the new kid?
He's all right.

82
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,326
Are you blind?
He is gorgeous!

83
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:54,373
- Have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,570
I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.

85
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:00,874
What was it? Who told you?

86
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:04,405
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?

87
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,418
I don't feel sorry for her.

88
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:09,216
You can't buy a diaphragm
through the mail. I'm serious.

89
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,348
Did she decide who the father was?

90
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,052
It was Duane Capps.

91
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:18,393
Wait! I've been going with
Duane Capps. He'd never have time.

92
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,159
How long does it take?

93
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,724
Ladies and gentlemen,
moving up behind us...

94
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:26,329
you'll notice the
incredible barf-mobile.

95
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:31,435
Come on!

96
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,505
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?

97
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,845
You lonely tonight?

98
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,785
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?

99
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:45,051
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!

100
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,360
Come on! No guts, huh?

101
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:02,202
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.

102
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:05,210
- Come on!
- You chicken!

103
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:10,739
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!

104
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:13,752
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

105
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,449
- Edna, slow down, please.
- Throw it, honey.

106
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,287
Stop it!

107
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,792
I'll get closer.

108
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,762
You can do it. Keep coming!

109
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:33,731
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!

110
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:37,264
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!

111
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,606
Look, please be careful!

112
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:46,516
He's testing us! He's testing us!

113
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:53,123
Ariel, there's a truck!

114
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,861
Get in the car!

115
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,966
Shit! Get in the truck!

116
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:07,630
Get in the car!

117
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:12,974
Be careful!

118
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:23,854
Come on! Get in!

119
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,657
Get in!

120
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:40,199
Jesus, we should never
have let her done that.

121
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,846
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.

122
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,217
They've only been here
eight hours.

123
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:58,883
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.

124
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,586
I made you some of those
Toll House squares I promised.

125
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,494
Lulu, you taste one of these,
you'll burn your recipe.

126
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:06,498
Reverend, we have a little problem.

127
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:10,024
I heard the English teacher
is planning to teach that book.

128
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:13,037
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?

129
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,573
That's a great book.

130
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:22,472
Slaughterhouse Five.

131
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,948
It's, it's a classic.

132
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:28,212
Do you read much?

133
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:32,018
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.

134
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,252
Tom Sawyer is a classic.

135
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:46,297
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.

136
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:49,034
You sure Ren
doesn't want something?

137
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:51,133
We're both a little tired
from the move.

138
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,303
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.

139
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,748
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.

140
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:01,253
It's a shock to the system,
moving out here from the big city.

141
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,551
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.

142
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:07,149
Sarah! Amy, eat!

143
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,059
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!

144
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,324
You sure you're not too tired?

145
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:14,332
No. Ren did most of the driving.

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,927
If you ask me,
Ren is a total fox.

147
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:20,872
Where did you hear that?

148
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,003
See how television and those
kinds of books influence children?

149
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:38,722
What the hell's the problem?

150
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,851
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!

151
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:46,023
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!

152
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:47,861
You almost did.

153
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,901
That's what you get
for sniffing spray starch.

154
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,904
After he graduated,
they drained his brain.

155
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,805
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.

156
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,706
Wendy Jo!

157
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,005
Yes?

158
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,705
Bring me Edna's fries.

159
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,975
Oh, sure!

160
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,985
Where are you going?

161
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,987
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.

162
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:13,048
You be careful with that.

163
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,992
Your daddy hears you playin' it,
he'll bust your butt.

164
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:50,689
He put his hands all over!

165
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:12,068
Your mother didn't think
you had any money with you.

166
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,822
Yeah, Mom?

167
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,833
You about ready to go?

168
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,835
You gonna wear that tie?

169
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,530
Yeah.

170
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,631
I think you might want
to dress down for now.

171
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,733
Why? I like the tie.

172
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,644
September, when you go to college,
you can dress like David Bowie.

173
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,648
Come on, let's go.

174
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:42,927
Why don't you comb your hair?

175
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:44,938
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?

176
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:47,634
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.

177
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:51,839
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.

178
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:56,043
I like that hat. They sell
men's clothes where you got that?

179
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,219
Willard, come on.

180
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:03,148
- What's your name?
- Ren.

181
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,193
My name's Willard. Hewitt.

182
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,320
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?

183
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:11,263
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.

184
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,325
I swear, one of these days--

185
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:20,503
That tie is fabulous!

186
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,874
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let
anyone tell you any different.

187
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,916
Right?

188
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,750
Very good.

189
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,053
Girl, you are on!

190
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:47,157
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.

191
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,896
Ah, fish.

192
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,167
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce
off the goddamn walls here.

193
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,174
What do you do there?

194
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:57,473
Oh, I don't know. Same thing
you do here. What do you do here?

195
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:59,479
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.

196
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:05,214
I'll tell you, there was this place
called the Blue Heaven.

197
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:09,245
It was great. Had to steal IDs
to get in, but it was incredible.

198
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:13,055
It was like a huge
underground circus, you know.

199
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:17,030
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.

200
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:20,499
And millions of girls,
like from the university mostly.

201
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:24,564
If we could get one to dance,
just one, then that was it.

202
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,937
We'd get out on the floor
and we'd really start to smoke.

203
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:29,841
We'd start cuttin' in,
and these girls would stop.

204
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:33,278
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?

205
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:36,647
You know, they'd start
to warm up a little. Right?

206
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,209
Pretty soon,
they'd start buying us beers.

207
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,517
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,022
Ah, shit.

209
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:45,355
Wait. There was this one.

210
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:50,593
This was the best.
Ginger.

211
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:53,361
Listen. We started dancing, right?

212
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:56,666
Slow dancing,
like we're stuck to each other.

213
00:16:56,738 --> 00:17:00,037
Eventually it's obvious to me that
she wants to do more than dance.

214
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:03,009
Right? So we left the place.

215
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,310
On the way to the car, she's
already got her tongue in my ear.

216
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,316
We get to the car.

217
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:12,148
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?

218
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,518
But she says,
''Hey, that's no problem.''

219
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,788
She's got seats in the car
that recline back. All the way back.

220
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,796
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?

221
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:25,298
Would I shit you? Right?

222
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,392
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.

223
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,166
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying
to get over the stick shift...

224
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,332
'cause we're goin'
like a freight train now.

225
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,502
All of a sudden, she starts
screaming at the top of her lungs...

226
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:41,379
''Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!''

227
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,713
Oh, shit, really?

228
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,691
But we did dance.

229
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,696
We danced our asses off.

230
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:59,291
Willard, how could you let
our new student eat this food?

231
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:03,804
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.

232
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:07,831
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.

233
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,672
Oh, chicken!

234
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:14,204
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.

235
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,944
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?

236
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:19,145
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.

237
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,882
- Why?
- It's illegal.

238
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,423
Jump back!

239
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,617
It's true.

240
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:27,957
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?

241
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,361
Go ahead, tell him.

242
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,127
It started when kids
got killed in a car wreck.

243
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:38,138
Whole town went bananas, blaming
it on the music, liquor and dancing.

244
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:41,198
Now they're just convinced
it's all a sin.

245
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,903
Who's convinced?

246
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,275
Whole damn town.

247
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:55,252
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.

248
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,918
It's true. This isn't the only
place either. You'd be surprised.

249
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:01,154
Places upstate you can't dance.

250
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,995
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.

251
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,660
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya
can't dance where she lives either.

252
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:10,226
Yeah? She ever get busted
for bopping?

253
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:12,239
I don't know.
I never asked her.

254
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,143
You rich?

255
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,202
No. Why?

256
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,645
'Cause I don't think
I ever bought a tape before.

257
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:24,344
Get serious!
This place is too weird.

258
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,353
Don't you ever listen
to the radio?

259
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,855
No. We got one radio at home,
but it's never on.

260
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,857
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?

261
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:32,984
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?

262
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,894
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?

263
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:39,422
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?

264
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,593
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.

265
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,194
- In concert?
- No, behind you.

266
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,638
What? Oh, shit!

267
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,883
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?

268
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,945
Just step out of the car, please.

269
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:05,186
-Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?

270
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,728
You got a license?

271
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,228
Catch.

272
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:12,528
Hey, I just bought that.

273
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,592
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?

274
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,073
Watch that attitude, boy! This way
I don't have to take you in.

275
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:23,167
Twenty-five dollars. They wouldn't
even let me off with a warning.

276
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:26,236
You can't talk to our police
the way you talk to big city police.

277
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:28,612
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.

278
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:30,173
Sarah, hush.

279
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,947
There was this bunch of kids
snuck over the state line...

280
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:34,989
to see some rock and roll group...

281
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:38,719
and they were stopped on their way
back into town by the police.

282
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:41,091
They were on church and
school probation for weeks!

283
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:45,030
You better watch your step
around here, young man.

284
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:07,987
Daddy?

285
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:14,857
I'm sorry about the other night
at the drive-in, about the music.

286
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,964
I was surprised.

287
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:19,727
Yeah.

288
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,448
I don't know what came over me.

289
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:39,248
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.

290
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,755
What's the music?

291
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:55,201
Oh, it's-- I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.

292
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,899
And that kind of music's okay?

293
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:04,809
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse
people's minds and bodies.

294
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:09,215
I don't--

295
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,746
What?

296
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:17,648
I see.

297
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:27,393
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.

298
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:28,901
I will.

299
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,669
What is it?

300
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:43,578
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.

301
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:54,027
Grab my books.

302
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,029
Let me in.

303
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,460
How you doin'?

304
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:07,800
You the new kid?

305
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:13,372
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?

306
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:19,050
I thought only pansies
wore neckties.

307
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,524
Oh, yeah? See that? I thought
only assholes used the word pansy.

308
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:27,254
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!

309
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:30,661
Son of a bitch
is gonna pay for that!

310
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:36,203
Either you got jumbo coconut balls,
or you're really pretty stupid.

311
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,036
-Who was that douche bag?
-He's a weasel, but watch your back.

312
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,936
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.

313
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:49,448
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.

314
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:51,542
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

315
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:53,553
You're not stupid, are you?

316
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:56,289
You trying to piss me off?

317
00:23:57,592 --> 00:24:00,925
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna
give you problems right off...

318
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:02,963
because you're an outsider.

319
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,931
You're dangerous. They're always
gonna worry about ya.

320
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,699
Screw 'em. And this is only one
little corner of the world.

321
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:15,935
Start Thursday?

322
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,644
Sounds okay.

323
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:44,938
Oh, hi, Ariel.

324
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,940
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.

325
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,977
Meet him the back
of his daddy's field tomorrow...

326
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:51,841
5:30.

327
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,746
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?

328
00:24:55,883 --> 00:25:00,013
-You'll have to show up to find out.
-And if I don't?

329
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:03,853
People will know you're scared.

330
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:07,926
Anyway, Chuck will find you.

331
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:10,327
You want that?

332
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,865
You're backing up!

333
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:13,491
Hey, yo!

334
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:17,229
How come he sent you?

335
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:19,296
I volunteered.

336
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,637
MacCormack, where the hell are you?

337
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,143
You know her?

338
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,874
So she tells me...

339
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,818
that I pissed Chuck off, right?

340
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:36,288
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.

341
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:39,690
He figured you were gonna chicken
and never-- Impressive.

342
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,364
Kinda out of it.

343
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,663
I had to go to work last year.

344
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:49,669
You still move it.

345
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:54,572
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna
tell her pop and you're gonna burn.

346
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:58,703
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?

347
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:01,839
She's just trying to make people
forget she's a preacher's kid.

348
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:06,210
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.

349
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:09,916
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?

350
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:12,016
I think she's been kissed a lot.

351
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:21,595
You'd never guess
your daddy's a fire chief.

352
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,537
You'd never guess your daddy's
a minister. Red Boots.

353
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:28,632
My daddy hates me
wearing these boots.

354
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:31,940
And you love that, don't you?

355
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,879
What are you gonna do
when I go away to college?

356
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,946
Why do you wanna do that, honey?

357
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:46,858
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for more
than this small town.

358
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,156
You're as small town
as they come.

359
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,935
A chicken race with tractors?

360
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:10,278
- How hard could it be?
-Just like a car. It's easy.

361
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:13,787
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.

362
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:16,482
Oh, hell, Ren,
just remember to stay calm.

363
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:19,822
Calm? I've never driven
a tractor before.

364
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:24,991
It's easy. Look. This is your
clutch, your gas, your brake.

365
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:27,660
You start off,
you just shift it into high.

366
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:29,828
Don't worry about your one, two,
three, four.Just put it into third.

367
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:33,067
Once you get going,
slam it into fourth.

368
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,576
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.

369
00:27:36,644 --> 00:27:40,512
I'll bet he's scared shitless,
and he turns out in ten seconds.

370
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:46,648
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?

371
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,712
Whose side are you on
anyway, honey?

372
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,723
You had a lot to smoke.

373
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,850
Don't tell me
I had enough to smoke.

374
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,896
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.

375
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,988
Don't tell me that either!

376
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:03,125
Why don't you go tell dog-face
we're ready to go! Yeah!

377
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,978
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!

378
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,042
-Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.

379
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,283
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!

380
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:26,558
How did I get myself into this?

381
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:29,289
Hey, Woody, come here.

382
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:35,000
Listen, has anybody
ever died doing this?

383
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:37,230
Just once.

384
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,499
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!

385
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:43,873
When this hat flies in the air,
you better have your butt in gear.

386
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:27,780
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!

387
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,304
Let's see what you're made of!

388
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,878
Come on, sucker!

389
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:52,849
Chuck, move it!

390
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,799
You wanna go up, huh?

391
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,303
There you go.

392
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,407
Oh, you wanna go down.

393
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:16,581
Kick his ass!

394
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,419
That's it!Jump, you chicken!

395
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,052
Sit down!

396
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,400
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?

397
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:44,444
You stupid idiot!

398
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,103
Get off!

399
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,703
Turn out!

400
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:49,749
Oh, shit!

401
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,337
Help! He tried to kill me.

402
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,761
Excuse me. Thank you.

403
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,523
I don't believe this town.

404
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:43,969
Hello.

405
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,900
Tell me.

406
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,373
He has team practice
every day until 4:00.

407
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:53,504
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.

408
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,208
You already knew that.

409
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,808
He hasn't dated
since he's been in town.

410
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:03,720
And late Friday nights,
by the light of the full moon...

411
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,124
he breaks into churchyards and bites
the heads off live chickens.

412
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,624
Come on, what is it? Chuck?

413
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,568
I never did think he had
all his dogs barking anyway.

414
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:21,334
Besides, what is wrong about
getting a little psyched over Ren?

415
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,467
He's cute.
He's from out of town.

416
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:26,068
Don't tell me that doesn't curl
your toes. I know you too well.

417
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,674
You want out of here so bad,
you probably memorize bus schedules.

418
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:31,512
And you don't?

419
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,461
Hey, asshole.

420
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:52,505
Interested in some
really good shit?

421
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:55,564
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.

422
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,406
Don't get smart-ass!

423
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:02,847
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.

424
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:06,113
And I got a friend here who can
help you out from time to time.

425
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:10,145
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers--

426
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,454
We'll just call this a sample,
and you know where you can get more.

427
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:17,861
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?

428
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,422
You're taking chances
being new in this school.

429
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,695
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!

430
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:32,775
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?

431
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,107
I'm gonna get you.

432
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:39,084
You wait.

433
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:42,644
The Reverend was right about you.

434
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:56,227
A bunch of kids was raising hell
at Burlington Cranston's property.

435
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:59,397
Tore up the fields,
turned over a tractor.

436
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:03,336
Today someone suggested
to me there's been...

437
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,470
some trouble at the high school,
I think it was drugs.

438
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:12,517
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.

439
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:14,850
- He said, ''No.''
- Amy.

440
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,481
I said, ''No, sir.''

441
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:21,721
You know, whenever we used
to call your folks in Chicago...

442
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:23,922
I don't think there was
any trouble, was there?

443
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,870
I don't know what
to make of it.

444
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:35,897
-People are pointing your direction.
-What did they say?

445
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:40,504
What I've been telling you
about the trouble and drugs.

446
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,641
You seem to be having trouble since
you moved here. And I figured--

447
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:47,346
You figured where there's smoke,
there's fire, right?

448
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,388
Usually works like that.

449
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,656
Look, you know I would never try
to take the place of your father.

450
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,663
Well, there's no chance of that.

451
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,869
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.

452
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,983
Big time!

453
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,582
What are you doing here?

454
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,251
Watching.

455
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:16,727
I thought I was alone.

456
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:20,789
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.

457
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,606
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?

458
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:33,578
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.

459
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:39,951
Maybe because if I did, your
boyfriend would remove my lungs.

460
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,645
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.

461
00:38:43,723 --> 00:38:46,556
He likes to act like he does,
but he doesn't.

462
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,556
Do you wanna kiss me?

463
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:55,391
Someday.

464
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,735
What is this someday shit?

465
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:04,073
I get the feeling
you've been kissed a lot.

466
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:07,237
I'm afraid I'd suffer
by comparison.

467
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,247
You don't think much
of me, do you?

468
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,450
You think I'm small town?

469
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,829
I think Bomont's a small town.

470
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,161
I'm going away.

471
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:31,734
I've already applied to colleges.

472
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:35,467
I applied to colleges my father
doesn't know I applied to.

473
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,102
He's gonna come after me,
but I'm gonna be gone.

474
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:57,489
Wanna see something?

475
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:01,358
Sure.

476
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:08,335
We call it ''The Yearbook.''

477
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:12,242
It started four or
five years ago, I guess.

478
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:14,473
It's stuff we're not
supposed to read.

479
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,055
This is all out of books?

480
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:26,956
Most of it.
Some songs, magazines.

481
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:30,687
Some poems that get made up.

482
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:39,400
''I'll sing to you of silver swans,
of kingdoms and carillons.''

483
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:43,499
''I'll sing of bodies intertwined
underneath an innocent sky.''

484
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,279
You wrote that?

485
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:49,747
It's not even one of my best.

486
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:51,511
It's all right.

487
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:01,626
Wait a minute.
You hear that?

488
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:03,685
- What?
- The train. You hear it?

489
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,730
Sometimes after football games
we come out here.

490
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:14,432
Just a few of us.
And we stand here.

491
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:18,204
Then when the train comes,
we make out like crazy.

492
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:20,845
Oh, yeah?

493
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,845
Most of the time
we just stand and scream.

494
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,408
Scream?

495
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,456
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.

496
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,636
Don't screw around.

497
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:42,860
Come on.

498
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,565
Come on,
I'll take you home.

499
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:07,152
- It's late.
- Yeah.

500
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:13,456
It's hard to impose a curfew on the
young people in my congregation...

501
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:17,121
that I can't even enforce
in my own home.

502
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:25,066
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

503
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:27,538
- Were you smoking something?
- No!

504
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,072
I wasn't stealing,
gambling, dancing...

505
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:33,704
or reading books
I'm not supposed to.

506
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,510
I am late!

507
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:38,641
Who were you with?

508
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,084
Ren MacCormack.

509
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:44,715
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?

510
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,691
I've heard he's a troublemaker.

511
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,023
Just 'cause he hasn't lived
in this town for 20 years...

512
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:51,029
doesn't make him a troublemaker!

513
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:54,464
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

514
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,866
There ain't nothing
to do with me, Daddy.

515
00:43:56,936 --> 00:44:01,451
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.

516
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:20,664
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?

517
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:22,671
Because somebody's got it in for me.

518
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:26,505
Coach found out I brought Ariel
home late, so I'm a troublemaker.

519
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:30,512
That's not why
I'm off the team. No, no.

520
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,017
I'm off'cause they don't have funds
for one more gymnast, but thank you.

521
00:44:35,085 --> 00:44:39,044
I'm busting my balls trying to fit
in and every door slams in my face.

522
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:42,216
Hey, MacCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.

523
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,260
Don't fool around
with the preacher's daughter!

524
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,558
How does anybody live in this town?

525
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,326
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.

526
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:53,699
-I got an attitude problem?
-I'm not the only one who's noticed.

527
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,831
We're not living in the goddamn
Middle Ages. We got TV, Family Feud.

528
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,207
We're not stuck in
Leave It to Beaver land here.

529
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:05,942
Well, I haven't noticed
a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.

530
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:11,045
I haven't either,
but I'm waiting patiently.

531
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:13,055
I tell you what I'd like to do.

532
00:45:13,123 --> 00:45:17,287
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside
each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.

533
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:19,329
Yeah, you know what else
we could do?

534
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:22,923
We could start one of your
nightclubs right in the church.

535
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:27,634
That's it.
That's it, man.

536
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:29,967
What's it?

537
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,200
A dance.

538
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:33,709
- What?
- A dance!

539
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:37,144
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?

540
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:40,547
-You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
-You're gonna get me angry!

541
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:42,881
Gonna turn this town upside down!

542
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,386
Stop it!

543
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:51,992
I was down in Denver last year...

544
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:55,327
for about a week
at a Bible convention.

545
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,334
And the whole time I was there,
people would come up...

546
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:03,169
and ask me, ''Reverend, how can
you live in such a small town...

547
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,301
so far away from the hustle
and bustle of the 20th century?''

548
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:10,642
I'd say to them,
''You'd never ask me that...

549
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:13,444
if you could just once,
just for one minute...

550
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:18,580
experience the feeling of family
that comes from knowing...

551
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:21,590
that all of our lives
are tied up with each of us.

552
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:24,617
That we feel all the same joys...

553
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:29,631
the same sorrows,
and that we care.

554
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:33,302
Each and every one of us cares
for the other.''

555
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:36,102
I told them...

556
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:39,540
''I just feel closer
to my Lord out there.

557
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:43,306
And I feel closer...

558
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,372
and safer with my people...

559
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,044
and I think they feel closer to me.

560
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,823
The Lord smiles on us out there.

561
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,355
And that's why I'm staying.''

562
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:01,361
Why don't you have some cake?

563
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:09,735
Roger, the town council
has no intention of bowing...

564
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,740
to wishes of a small group
of students.

565
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:17,144
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain
that this boy is organizing a dance.

566
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:19,978
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around...

567
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,146
it won't be long before every
community standard is violated.

568
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:26,189
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!

569
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:29,157
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.

570
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:31,160
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.

571
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:33,196
I want you to see
what you've been missing.

572
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:35,390
I know you're not gonna
let Willard fight, right?

573
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:39,868
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.

574
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:05,620
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.

575
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:07,458
Come on!

576
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:10,261
I'll watch you guys, see if
you can show me something new.

577
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,564
We didn't come all this way
just to sit it out.

578
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:18,131
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

579
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:21,905
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.

580
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,245
I can't dance.

581
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:28,978
You what?

582
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:31,282
I can't dance.

583
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:34,482
At all.

584
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:39,091
All right. All right.

585
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:44,761
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.

586
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,313
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.

587
00:48:58,381 --> 00:49:00,474
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.

588
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,484
I wanna get a beer.

589
00:49:51,868 --> 00:49:53,995
Waitress, let me have another beer.

590
00:50:47,257 --> 00:50:50,192
I can't help myself!

591
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:10,035
Hey, I came with that girl.

592
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:12,700
Doesn't look like
you're leaving with her.

593
00:52:15,478 --> 00:52:18,174
Hey, I guess you didn't
hear me the first time.

594
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:21,775
-No fights. You don't even know him.
-Why don't you flake off?

595
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:25,984
No fights.

596
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:29,786
When was the last time
you seen your dick, partner?

597
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:39,360
Rusty, he was fighting
to save your honor.

598
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:42,405
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.

599
00:52:42,472 --> 00:52:45,032
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.

600
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:46,541
Forget it.

601
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:48,304
Ow! Come on!

602
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:52,277
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.

603
00:52:52,348 --> 00:52:54,373
One hundred proof, oh, yea.

604
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:56,612
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.

605
00:52:56,686 --> 00:52:58,779
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.

606
00:53:01,257 --> 00:53:02,485
Oh, what?

607
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,288
Oh, yea.

608
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:13,767
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.

609
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:16,070
How come?

610
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:22,571
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.

611
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:25,546
- You've heard it.
- No.

612
00:53:25,615 --> 00:53:28,880
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago...

613
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:32,888
these kids were playing highway tag
and they were drunk.

614
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:37,586
One car hits the other one, and
they both go over the bridge. Dead.

615
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:42,263
That's when they started passing
laws against booze...

616
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:44,732
against dancing and drinking.

617
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:47,099
I don't know.

618
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,469
My father had a field day.

619
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,532
Your father? Why?

620
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,908
My older brother
was one who got killed.

621
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:59,247
You should've seen Bobby.

622
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:01,875
He was like Warren Beatty,
only taller. Wasn't he?

623
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:06,246
My father went off the deep end.

624
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:09,485
He decided we all needed saving,
no matter what.

625
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:13,586
He's gonna personally save this
pissant town and deliver it...

626
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:16,632
to heaven with his daughter
sitting like a cherry on top.

627
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:43,083
I called over to Rusty's last night.

628
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:51,790
I don't understand why you feel
it necessary to lie to me.

629
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,470
I don't know why you find
it necessary to check up on me.

630
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:58,473
I'm concerned about
your well-being, that's all.

631
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:01,476
How come when I'm home you're never
as interested in what I do or say...

632
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:03,876
as you are when
I walk out that door?

633
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,847
Wham! Suddenly
you wanna know everything!

634
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:08,042
I don't like this outburst...

635
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:11,553
any more than I like
not knowing where you were!

636
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:13,782
Shaw, don't you think
we could wait on this?

637
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:17,690
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired
of you coming in on her side!

638
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,024
She'll have to start
answering for herself.

639
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:23,532
I don't know why. You don't listen
to me any more than you do her.

640
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,221
I've never hit anyone in my life.

641
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:58,457
We're losing her, Vi.

642
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:02,869
- Don't you see that?
- No.

643
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:07,876
I see you chasing after her,
and I see her running from you.

644
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:12,347
She's become so willful
and obstinate.

645
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,077
She's like her father.

646
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:22,118
The two of you
were so wonderful once.

647
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:26,389
You had so much to talk about.

648
00:56:26,462 --> 00:56:28,692
I was almost jealous.

649
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:36,267
It's not as if we don't talk.

650
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,501
It's just that...

651
00:56:41,077 --> 00:56:44,012
sometimes people run out
of things to say.

652
00:56:57,527 --> 00:56:58,824
Shaw?

653
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:05,198
It's 20 years now
I've been a minister's wife.

654
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:11,967
And I've been quiet,
supportive, unobtrusive and...

655
00:57:13,843 --> 00:57:18,303
after 20 years I still think
you're a wonderful preacher.

656
00:57:19,749 --> 00:57:21,717
You can lift a congregation
up so high...

657
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:23,843
they have to look down
to see heaven.

658
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:32,418
But it's the one-to-one
where you need a little work.

659
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,971
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.

660
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:49,375
But we're not talking
about a free-for-all.

661
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:53,006
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.

662
00:57:53,082 --> 00:57:56,950
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.

663
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,079
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.

664
00:58:00,156 --> 00:58:02,522
Sounds great to me.

665
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:05,026
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.

666
00:58:05,094 --> 00:58:07,688
You got it.

667
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:10,392
Chuck has heard something
that's upset him real good.

668
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:14,698
I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago Big Shot.

669
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:19,140
He heard you're gonna try and throw
a dance at school. A senior dance.

670
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:23,076
He figured only a dumb fag would try
that. Is that what you're trying?

671
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:25,080
He sure the hell is!

672
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:28,908
Excuse me, girls.
Come out, Ren.

673
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,885
You guys stay there.

674
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:33,148
Is he really gonna
get us a dance?

675
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,156
Yep. Ain't ya?

676
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,525
- It's about time, MacCormack.
- I'll be there.

677
00:58:38,594 --> 00:58:39,925
Thanks.

678
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,952
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?

679
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:46,077
You treat animals like that?

680
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,147
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?

681
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,419
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.

682
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,428
What do you mean
I gotta fight city hall?

683
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:57,294
'Cause there's a town council.

684
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,995
It's made up of seven people.

685
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:06,029
Shaw Moore's one of'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.

686
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:09,305
Personally, I don't like
that lousy son of a bitch.

687
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,903
They meet every third Thursday
of the month.

688
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,778
Something you want in this town,
you'll have to talk to them.

689
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,546
You're gonna get really creamed.

690
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,588
Geez. I'm not so good
with words.

691
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:24,285
Keep thinking like that, man,
and you are gonna get creamed.

692
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:27,453
Woody doesn't know
a dance from a dipstick.

693
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:32,028
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?

694
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,534
Huh? Willard,
which way is your left?

695
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,231
He don't know his left foot
from his right foot.

696
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:40,605
I'll tell you something. If I gotta
get up in front of that council...

697
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:42,610
you gotta learn to dance.

698
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,643
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.

699
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:05,145
I hope you wouldn't.

700
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:09,513
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is
calling about that dance at school.

701
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:12,348
Would you tell her I'll call her
back after Junior Bible?

702
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,945
What were you saying?

703
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:16,957
This was found in one of
the athletic lockers at school.

704
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:18,959
A book like this should be burned.

705
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:22,087
We should go to the library
and remove this corruption.

706
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:25,497
There's no sense blowing it up
into something that it isn't.

707
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,228
Hello! Careful.

708
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:30,630
Come on, Max.

709
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,367
I'll set up, Vi.

710
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,705
I think it's quite obvious
what it is.

711
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:37,836
It's not quite so obvious
how I should handle it.

712
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:41,007
Reverend, if you'll excuse
my saying so...

713
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,313
when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school...

714
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:46,411
we didn't get
any support from you.

715
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,457
Because I didn't think we had
any grounds for his dismissal.

716
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:52,550
Around here, it caused
a lot of folks some worry.

717
01:03:52,627 --> 01:03:55,027
A lot of folks worry
a little too much.

718
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:58,227
Doesn't take much time
for corruption to take root.

719
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,268
How long is that, Roger?

720
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:03,202
About as long as
it takes compassion to die?

721
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,166
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!

722
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:12,509
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!

723
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,775
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.

724
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:45,779
I know why
you don't call me.

725
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:48,911
I wanted to tell you myself.

726
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:51,179
I know why you don't want
to see me anymore.

727
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,346
I'm not stupid!

728
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,853
I'm not blind.

729
01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:00,191
It's MacCormack, ain't it?

730
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:04,790
You're just dying to screw
MacCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?

731
01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:06,891
You're so stupid!

732
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,458
Stupid?

733
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,472
Think I don't see you looking at him
like some bitch in heat?

734
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,474
You'll wrap those skinny legs
around anybody.

735
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,600
Shut up!

736
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:18,905
Is that what I get? Huh?

737
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:20,811
I treated you decent!

738
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,883
Shit.

739
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,326
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.

740
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,766
-Jesus!
- You think about it!

741
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:52,037
Stop it, Chuck!

742
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:10,530
'Bout through with you anyway.

743
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:27,279
I'm sorry you have
to see me like this.

744
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:30,512
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in
at home. I'll be fine.

745
01:06:30,585 --> 01:06:33,520
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.

746
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:41,057
Thanks for coming for me.

747
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,865
I don't understand.

748
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:47,367
There's nothing to understand.

749
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:50,131
It's for taking on my father.

750
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:54,107
Wait a minute.
I got no beef with him.

751
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:58,407
No, wait. This is my fight, it's
with the town, not with one guy.

752
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,849
You don't get to turn my fight
into a ''screw you'' to your old man.

753
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:13,927
Hey, look...

754
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:18,561
maybe--

755
01:07:21,102 --> 01:07:24,629
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard
to forget your brother...

756
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:29,171
or to try to make your father
forget him, you know?

757
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:36,281
- It's not that easy.
- I know.

758
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:40,421
Do I still get the box?

759
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,257
Gimme the box.

760
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:00,240
Nice.

761
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:11,151
Think you might ever kiss me?

762
01:08:57,165 --> 01:08:59,725
Harvey and Bernie
were here for a long time.

763
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:03,203
They still talking
about that dance?

764
01:09:03,271 --> 01:09:04,704
Yeah.

765
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:12,768
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.

766
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:19,115
That's one more thing Ariel is not
going to forgive me for, but--

767
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:25,092
Can you step out of the way enough
to realize she's doing this for you?

768
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,593
Me?

769
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:30,493
I don't see that.

770
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:32,499
I just know that
when kids dance together...

771
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:35,536
they become sexually irresponsible.

772
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:37,662
I can't take the chance--

773
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:41,541
What's so funny?

774
01:09:43,545 --> 01:09:47,242
You talk like that's the only thing
that gets them excited.

775
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:51,880
Don't you remember when we used to
look at each other and get excited?

776
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:56,857
It's just the same with them.

777
01:09:58,359 --> 01:10:00,486
You're not gonna put
their eyes out.

778
01:10:18,012 --> 01:10:20,810
None of this is gonna undo
one stupid accident.

779
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,219
I'm responsible for
the spiritual life of this community.

780
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:30,991
Shaw, you can't be
a father to everybody.

781
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:33,050
You can't do that.

782
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,731
I thought that at least
you believed in me.

783
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,646
I never stopped.

784
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,145
Be at the town council meeting
tomorrow night.

785
01:10:58,219 --> 01:10:59,652
Only fairies dance.

786
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:03,056
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.

787
01:11:03,124 --> 01:11:06,753
Support Ren MacCormack at
the council meeting tomorrow night.

788
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:08,853
You can make a difference!

789
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:13,230
I'm calling to remind you
to come to the town council meeting.

790
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,806
Hi.

791
01:11:19,874 --> 01:11:21,899
- Still hurt?
- Naw.

792
01:11:21,976 --> 01:11:23,944
Good.

793
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:25,980
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.

794
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,381
Look, I--

795
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:31,448
Yeah.

796
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:33,453
Yeah, I'm nervous.

797
01:11:33,521 --> 01:11:36,979
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to the council.

798
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,686
There's only seven of them, right?

799
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:44,264
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.

800
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,192
Take a deep breath.
You ready?

801
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:56,305
What is it? The Holy Bible?

802
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:04,708
Ah, this is great.

803
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:09,322
This is great! What--

804
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:13,292
How'd you know where
to find all this?

805
01:12:13,361 --> 01:12:14,794
Are you kidding?

806
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,633
I wanna tell you something.

807
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:24,137
Thanks.

808
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:35,848
Come on.

809
01:12:42,557 --> 01:12:44,491
What the hell is that?

810
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:49,761
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?

811
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,094
''Burn in hell''?
This says, ''Burn in hell.''

812
01:12:56,537 --> 01:13:00,064
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.

813
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:01,699
Do you see now?

814
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:04,768
You don't wave flags here
without people taking shots at them.

815
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:06,871
This is not the first time.

816
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:10,714
My business was off, but people
are taking business away from me.

817
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:15,245
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls
and today your mother lost her job.

818
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:16,756
Mom, is that true?

819
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:20,384
Mr. Collins said
he heard things about you.

820
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,520
He thought I ought to stay home
and be a proper mother.

821
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:24,861
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.

822
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:26,866
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.

823
01:13:26,934 --> 01:13:28,799
- There's other jobs!
- Where?

824
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,896
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.

825
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:34,635
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?

826
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:37,041
Now will you stop?

827
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:40,439
I don't understand this town.

828
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:43,075
It's like something's
choking everybody...

829
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:45,278
only they don't know
they're choking.

830
01:13:45,353 --> 01:13:46,501
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

831
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:48,765
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

832
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:54,100
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.

833
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:56,337
I know.
That's what I mean.

834
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,906
I watch you, I see.

835
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:10,285
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.

836
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,434
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.

837
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:27,874
I thought it was something
that I wasn't doing right.

838
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:33,040
And I figured there was something
I could do to make it like it was...

839
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,640
and then he'd want to stay,
you know.

840
01:14:38,153 --> 01:14:41,645
But when he left
just like that...

841
01:14:41,723 --> 01:14:46,353
I realized that everything I'd done
hoping that he'd stay--

842
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:52,962
everything I'd done,
it didn't mean shit.

843
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:55,268
Didn't matter.

844
01:14:57,406 --> 01:15:00,341
And I felt like,
''What difference does it make?''

845
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,144
But now--

846
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,077
Now I'm thinking...

847
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:11,779
I could really do something,
you know.

848
01:15:13,422 --> 01:15:17,256
I could really do something
for me this time, you know...

849
01:15:19,327 --> 01:15:21,795
otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.

850
01:15:39,047 --> 01:15:43,313
All right, Virginia, that ends
the discussion on this issue.

851
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:47,219
So the price of a dog license
will go from $3.50 to $4.50.

852
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:50,349
A licensed pet is a happy one.

853
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:53,121
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?

854
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:57,392
Thank you, Virginia.
It was real good.

855
01:15:57,466 --> 01:16:02,199
Now we can consider
any new business.

856
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:06,069
Excuse me.

857
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:09,838
Before we begin, I want
to remind all you kids...

858
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:13,403
we're conducting
an official meeting.

859
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:17,246
We're not gonna tolerate
any disturbances.

860
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:22,420
The floor is now open
for any new business.

861
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:26,825
My name is Ren MacCormack and
I would like to move on behalf...

862
01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:31,389
of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law...

863
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:34,663
against public dancing within the
town limits of Bomont be abolished.

864
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,005
Mr. Chairman,
could I address myself to this?

865
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:45,706
You bet.

866
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:49,045
Even if this was not a law...

867
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:51,551
which it is...

868
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:56,080
I'm afraid I would have difficulty
endorsing an enterprise...

869
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,424
which is as fraught
with genuine peril...

870
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:02,554
as I believe this one to be.

871
01:17:03,532 --> 01:17:09,368
Besides liquor and drugs, which
seem to accompany such an event...

872
01:17:09,437 --> 01:17:13,999
the thing that distresses me
even more, Ren...

873
01:17:14,075 --> 01:17:18,910
is the spiritual corruption
that can be involved.

874
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,508
These dances and this kind of music
can be destructive.

875
01:17:23,585 --> 01:17:26,782
And, Ren, I'm afraid
you're gonna find...

876
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:30,120
that most of the people in
our community will agree with me.

877
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:31,659
I do.

878
01:17:34,563 --> 01:17:37,930
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.

879
01:17:37,999 --> 01:17:41,435
- Will all those opposed--
- Excuse me, I--

880
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,836
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.

881
01:17:44,906 --> 01:17:46,931
This is outrageous!

882
01:17:47,008 --> 01:17:49,442
- If you think that we're--
- Eleanor, sit down.

883
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:57,245
I think Mr. MacCormack
has a right to be heard.

884
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,862
I just wanted to say a few words
about this motion...

885
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:12,661
so that you wouldn't think
that we were...

886
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:17,330
encouraging destruction
with this idea.

887
01:18:20,008 --> 01:18:24,035
''From the oldest of times, people
danced for a number of reasons.

888
01:18:25,113 --> 01:18:27,172
They danced in prayer...

889
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:30,514
or so that their crops
would be plentiful...

890
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:32,519
or so their hunt would be good.

891
01:18:33,855 --> 01:18:37,951
And they danced
to stay physically fit...

892
01:18:38,026 --> 01:18:41,587
and show their community spirit.

893
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,496
And they danced to celebrate.''

894
01:18:47,402 --> 01:18:50,496
And that is the dancing
we're talking about.

895
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:56,875
Aren't we told in Psalm 1 49?

896
01:18:59,614 --> 01:19:02,344
''Praise ye the Lord.

897
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:05,545
Sing unto the Lord a new song.

898
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:09,888
Let them praise his name
in the dance.''

899
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,550
Amen.

900
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:15,261
And it was King David--

901
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:19,664
King David, who
we read about in Samuel.

902
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:22,999
And what did David do?

903
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,266
What did David do?
What did David do?

904
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:31,176
''David danced before the Lord
with all his might...

905
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:36,377
leaping and dancing
before the Lord.''

906
01:19:36,451 --> 01:19:39,011
Leaping and dancing.

907
01:19:46,494 --> 01:19:49,554
Ecclesiastes assures us...

908
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:54,462
that there is a time
for every purpose under heaven.

909
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,106
A time to laugh...

910
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:02,109
and a time to weep.

911
01:20:03,878 --> 01:20:05,436
A time to mourn...

912
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:10,048
and there is a time to dance.

913
01:20:21,296 --> 01:20:24,322
And there was a time for this law,
but not anymore.

914
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,924
See, this is our time to dance.

915
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:32,337
It is our way
of celebrating life.

916
01:20:34,676 --> 01:20:37,144
It's the way it was
in the beginning.

917
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:43,912
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.

918
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:07,097
You know you were railroaded,
don't you? Huh?

919
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:12,507
When are you gonna wake up
and smell the coffee?

920
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:16,641
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting
with votes already in his pocket.

921
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,516
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.

922
01:21:22,023 --> 01:21:24,719
What are you gonna do now?

923
01:21:24,793 --> 01:21:26,226
It's over.

924
01:21:27,328 --> 01:21:29,296
What if it ain't?

925
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:31,992
What if you have your dance
in Bayson?

926
01:21:32,066 --> 01:21:34,864
No. The whole point was
to do something here in Bomont.

927
01:21:34,936 --> 01:21:37,234
Bayson's, what,
thirty miles away?

928
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:42,099
Not where it runs up
to these tracks it ain't.

929
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:48,346
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks
can't cross these tracks...

930
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,350
neither can the long arm
of the law.

931
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:52,579
What about the long arm
of Reverend Moore?

932
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:55,214
Remember he said if you could find
a way to convince him...

933
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,554
it wouldn't be a spiritual
corruption, he'd think about it.

934
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,651
- So?
- Make him think about it.

935
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,759
''And I beheld and heard
an angel flying...

936
01:22:09,838 --> 01:22:13,171
through the midst of heaven
saying with a loud voice:

937
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:16,699
'Woe, woe, woe...

938
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:19,440
to the inhabiters of the earth.'

939
01:22:19,514 --> 01:22:24,747
And I saw a star fall
from heaven unto the earth...

940
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:28,687
and the angel
was given the key...

941
01:22:28,756 --> 01:22:31,384
to the bottomless pit.

942
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:35,862
And he opened
the bottomless pit...

943
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:41,425
and there arose a smoke out of
the pit as smoke of a great furnace.

944
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:46,497
And the sun and air were darkened
by reason of the smoke of the pit.''

945
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:49,976
Yes?

946
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:53,639
I used to get such a kick
watching you work up your sermons.

947
01:22:56,718 --> 01:23:00,245
- And now?
- It's different.

948
01:23:00,321 --> 01:23:05,953
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?

949
01:23:08,396 --> 01:23:09,829
Well...

950
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:16,228
it's the only way I know
to reach people's emotions.

951
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,900
I haven't heard from you
for a while.

952
01:23:25,146 --> 01:23:27,171
When was it? Thursday?

953
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:30,517
I was angry, you were angry.

954
01:23:32,186 --> 01:23:34,120
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

955
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:40,585
If you weren't, you would've
asked me what was wrong. You knew.

956
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:44,792
Ariel, I cannot let
this dance happen.

957
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:47,027
Ren MacCormack made
a lot of people stop and think.

958
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:49,865
I object to that kind of music,
and I think you know why.

959
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:52,668
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.

960
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,641
- You told the church board that.
- That was not meant for your ears!

961
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:58,338
When do my ears get old enough?
When do you stop protecting me?

962
01:23:58,413 --> 01:23:59,778
I'm no saint!

963
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:02,179
It is my duty to look after
the spiritual growth of you--

964
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,480
I'm not even a virgin.

965
01:24:07,021 --> 01:24:09,512
- Don't talk like that in here!
- Why not?

966
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:14,051
Isn't this where I confess my sins
to my preacher? In church!

967
01:24:14,128 --> 01:24:18,121
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!

968
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:21,191
Don't do that in here. You
know better where to draw the line!

969
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:23,703
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.

970
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:26,331
They're over at the library.

971
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:33,579
Roger! Eleanor!
What are you doing?

972
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:35,582
We decided these books--

973
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:39,416
Who's we? Whose authority
are you acting on?

974
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:41,682
Hold it everybody!
Listen to me!

975
01:24:43,891 --> 01:24:47,054
When did you all decide
to sit in judgment?

976
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:54,095
Who elected you to be the saviors
of everybody's souls in Bomont?

977
01:24:54,168 --> 01:24:57,467
We have a perfect right to determine
what our children--

978
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:04,104
When you've burned all of these,
what are you gonna do then?

979
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:08,582
Chris, take these out of here.

980
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:14,616
Satan is not in these books.

981
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:17,249
He's in here!

982
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:20,158
He's in your hearts.

983
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:22,856
Go on home, all of you.

984
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:25,228
Go and sit in judgment
on yourselves.

985
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:29,968
And, Roger, go home.

986
01:25:31,205 --> 01:25:32,695
Eleanor, come on.

987
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,744
Go home now, both of you.

988
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:17,147
Sometimes things
don't make any sense.

989
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:21,621
If you could explain to me my father
maybe I could explain your son.

990
01:26:23,524 --> 01:26:25,458
But it doesn't make any sense.

991
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,165
Look, I gotta go.

992
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:37,862
Listen, I know you're gonna do
what you gotta do...

993
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:41,773
but thanks for listening.

994
01:26:48,616 --> 01:26:50,641
Thank you for--

995
01:26:53,354 --> 01:26:56,551
Well, thank you.

996
01:27:11,873 --> 01:27:14,740
That was your friend Ren.

997
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:18,575
He came here to ask me if he could
take you to a senior prom.

998
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:26,076
I'm running out of answers.

999
01:27:28,122 --> 01:27:30,090
I know how hard it is for you.

1000
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,928
I'm know I'm not making it easier.

1001
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:45,137
I just don't know that I believe
in everything you believe in...

1002
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:50,639
but I believe in you.

1003
01:28:15,269 --> 01:28:20,639
I'm standing up here
before you today...

1004
01:28:23,244 --> 01:28:25,508
with a very troubled heart.

1005
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:30,989
You see, my friends...

1006
01:28:30,989 --> 01:28:31,921
You see, my friends...

1007
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:36,890
I've always insisted on...

1008
01:28:36,962 --> 01:28:40,591
taking responsibility
for your lives.

1009
01:28:41,867 --> 01:28:45,030
But, I'm really...

1010
01:28:46,772 --> 01:28:49,434
like a first-time parent...

1011
01:28:50,509 --> 01:28:53,273
who makes mistakes...

1012
01:28:53,345 --> 01:28:56,712
and tries to learn from them.

1013
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,242
And like that parent...

1014
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:09,391
I find myself at that moment
when I have to decide.

1015
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,863
Do I hold on...

1016
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:19,099
or do I trust you
to yourselves?

1017
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:24,666
Let go and hope
that you've understood...

1018
01:29:24,743 --> 01:29:28,440
at least some of my lessons.

1019
01:29:32,885 --> 01:29:36,844
If we don't start trusting
our children...

1020
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:41,859
how will they
ever become trustworthy?

1021
01:29:44,696 --> 01:29:47,597
I'm told that the senior class
at the high school...

1022
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,692
has got use of
the warehouse in Bayson...

1023
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:55,468
for the purpose of
putting on a senior dance.

1024
01:29:56,909 --> 01:29:58,342
Please...

1025
01:30:00,012 --> 01:30:04,779
join me to pray
to the Lord...

1026
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,841
to guide them
in their endeavors.

1027
01:31:45,217 --> 01:31:46,411
Lights!

1028
01:32:09,074 --> 01:32:11,042
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.

1029
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:13,873
Yes, you do.
Yes, you look very nice.

1030
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,879
Yes, you do.
You look wonderful.

1031
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,177
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1032
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:26,954
You can't very well go to a prom
without a corsage.

1033
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,786
Oh, Mom.

1034
01:32:31,863 --> 01:32:33,888
This is gorgeous!

1035
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:41,264
- Where do you think I should--
- Here's a wrist thing.

1036
01:32:41,339 --> 01:32:43,534
Oh, Mom, you really
didn't have to.

1037
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:45,041
I didn't.

1038
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:52,682
Don't go on to him about it
because he'll only deny it.

1039
01:33:04,563 --> 01:33:08,727
I was gonna come up and get--
I was...

1040
01:33:09,935 --> 01:33:12,495
gonna come up and get you.

1041
01:33:12,571 --> 01:33:16,632
- What's the matter?
- You're beautiful.

1042
01:33:20,212 --> 01:33:21,645
What?

1043
01:33:29,755 --> 01:33:34,249
I mean it.
You are beautiful.

1044
01:33:40,599 --> 01:33:42,032
Come on.

1045
01:33:53,011 --> 01:33:54,444
Thank you.

1046
01:36:04,476 --> 01:36:08,071
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.

1047
01:36:08,146 --> 01:36:10,671
No. She won't even know
we're here. Come on.

1048
01:36:16,087 --> 01:36:18,920
You're the last folks I expected
to see around here tonight.

1049
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:21,754
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

1050
01:36:21,826 --> 01:36:23,953
Reverend, you done
a good thing here.

1051
01:36:24,963 --> 01:36:26,988
I'm still not sure
it was the right thing.

1052
01:36:27,065 --> 01:36:28,498
Comes close.

1053
01:36:46,518 --> 01:36:47,951
Shaw?

1054
01:36:58,697 --> 01:37:00,289
What is it?

1055
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:07,303
It's just the two of us again.

1056
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:28,124
- Shaw?
- What?

1057
01:37:29,728 --> 01:37:32,094
We're almost dancing.

1058
01:37:41,373 --> 01:37:43,841
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.

1059
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:55,780
Hello, Willard.

1060
01:37:57,022 --> 01:37:58,956
You promised you won't fight.

1061
01:37:59,024 --> 01:38:00,889
Don't you look sweet.

1062
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:08,254
- What do you want?
- I've got business with MacCormack.

1063
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:10,927
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?

1064
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,237
Hey, no fights, fellas.

1065
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,873
Sure, Willard.

1066
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,675
All right.

1067
01:38:22,914 --> 01:38:25,781
Cute.
No fights, Willard.

1068
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:30,514
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.

1069
01:38:31,923 --> 01:38:34,289
Let me go, goddamn it!

1070
01:38:35,427 --> 01:38:38,225
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?

1071
01:38:38,296 --> 01:38:41,697
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!

1072
01:38:44,936 --> 01:38:49,339
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.

1073
01:38:49,407 --> 01:38:52,137
You're a goddamn hero
when it's five to one.

1074
01:38:54,112 --> 01:38:56,740
Ren, get up!
Beat the shit out of him!

1075
01:39:08,293 --> 01:39:09,783
Bastard!

1076
01:39:14,265 --> 01:39:16,028
You're gonna dance now.

1077
01:39:28,813 --> 01:39:30,246
All right!

1078
01:39:35,253 --> 01:39:37,414
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.

1079
01:39:37,489 --> 01:39:39,650
Fighter heroes!

1080
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:42,750
I thought you guys were
actually gonna fight or something.

1081
01:39:42,827 --> 01:39:44,260
You're great.

1082
01:39:44,329 --> 01:39:48,288
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.

1083
01:39:48,366 --> 01:39:49,993
Let's dance!

1084
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,523
Just watch, all right?
