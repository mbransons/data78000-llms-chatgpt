 the prices of the lettuce

  on the shelf.

"Did you make
a pricing mistake?"

137
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,587

a frost in Arizona and
prices had gone up."

138
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,723
And I said,
 "But not for the lettuce
 that's already on the shelf."

 two heads of lettuce.

 64 cents.

 exactly 64 cents.

You wouldn't let me go on
 a field trip to a steel mill?

00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,518
There was a strike
 against it.

Everybody else got to go.

164

Gilbert, listen,
 I like what I'm doing.

168
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,465
I don't mind going to jail
for something I believe in.
It's a privilege.

 Were you ever sick alone?

 why don't you just
 relax a little?

00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,834
Uh-huh.

320
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,040
You know
 Claire and I are having
 an anniversary next month?

321
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,176
Ten years.

322
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,813
It's a long time, huh?

323
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,684
Dad.
Yeah.

324
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,255
What made you
 fall in love with her?

325
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,489
Claire?

326
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,592
Mother.
 Mmm.

327
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,799
It was the way she danced.

328
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,402
How'd she dance?

329
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,072
I met her at a party once.
 We were teenagers.

330
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,773
How did she dance?

331
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,610
She danced with everything.

332
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,613
Her whole body,
 her whole being, everything.

333
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,116
When she danced,
  she didn't think
  of anything else.

334
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,384
She still watching
 her weight?

335
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,618
Yeah.

336
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,987
She's always
  watching her weight.

337
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,225
God, we had fun.

338
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,331
The day we got married,

339
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,104
went down
to the courthouse
to get the license.

340
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,208
They sent us to a clerk.
 His name was

341
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,778
William Albert.

342
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,181
She wouldn't let him
write the license.

343
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,884
She doesn't trust men,
 she says, with two
 first names.

344
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,323
God, we had fun.

345
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,327
Two first names.

346
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,866
I don't know,
 we started drifting apart.

347
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,504
Always got outraged

348
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,839
by one thing or another.

349
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,041
She couldn't take life
 as it comes.

350
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,944
And I got tired, that's all.

351
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,049
I worked plenty hard,
 I wanted peace and quiet.

352
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,920
And she wouldn't give me that,
 the damn fool.

353
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,026
If she would've
  changed just a little,

354
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,661

What more can
 a man ask for?

359
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,846
She still wear
 orthopedic shoes?

360
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,282
Yeah.

361
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,652
She always
 had lousy feet.

362
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,397
Hi. I'm going
 for a sandwich.
 You want to come?

363
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,800
I probably should
 tell you, Jane.

364

I'm married.

365

I just
invited you to
eat a sandwich.

366

Oh... Uh, okay.

367
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,384
I think elevators
 are very sexual,
 don't you?

368
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,921
I have this fantasy
that I'm in an elevator
all alone with this man

369
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,723
that I've never met
  before in my entire life

370
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,425
and he just keeps
 staring at me.

371
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,094
All of a sudden,
 he reaches out and
 he touches my breast.

372
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,029
Well, I think it's
very inappropriate,

373
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,865
but I don't stop him.

374
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,733
The elevator's
 moving really slowly,

375
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,934
we're at the
World Trade Center,

376
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,103
and he just
 keeps on touching me.

377
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,373
We're at the 30th floor
 and he's feeling my waist,

378
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,176
the elevator
 keeps going up, his
 hands keep going down.

379
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,979
By the time we're
 at the 70th floor, we're
 actually having relations

380
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,481
and he just
  leaves without even
  telling me his name.

a little longer.

637
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,949
I'm tired of
chasing people,

638
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,085
renting hotel rooms,
 helicopters.

639
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,519
I'm tired of
spying on them.

640
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,889
The way
 they look at me,
 so condescending.

641
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,026
It just doesn't
 make sense anymore.

642
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,365
I'm sorry
 about your mother.
 Sounds like a nice lady.

643
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,912
It was raining
 cats and dogs.

644
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:54,118
I saw the Goodyear blimp
  pass by right outside
  my window there.

645
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,726
(SIGHS)
The Knicks beat
the Celtics, 97-96.

646
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,297
(GROANS VERY LOUDLY)

647
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:10,100
I want an eclair.

648
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,503
Please, honey, bring
  me an eclair, would you?

649
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,542
My turn?

650
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,576
Yeah.

651
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,718
I'm having trouble
 holding things lately.

652
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,255
I got a terrific word.

653
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,293
There are two checks
 to Angelo Dokakis.

654
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:42,399
One for $450
 and another for $675!

655
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,805
What's this check
 for cash, $50?

656
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,441
A check for $75, cash?

657
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,913
Our balance is $600.
 We have no money left.

658
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,416
Gillie, you know what we are?

659
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,919
Oh, my...

660
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,354
Do you know what we are?

661
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,423
No.

662
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,858
Oh, Gilbert.

663
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,926
What?

664
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,429
I can't say it.

665
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,566
Oh, God in heaven,
 I can't say the word.

666
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,769
What are we?

667
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,804
We are

668
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,673
poor.

669
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,845
Lisa, can you take care
 of the maintenance
 this month?

670
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,381
Are you serious?

671
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,617
To cut into
 the principal?

672
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,386
My father says it's
 like spitting on God.

673
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,092
What are you doing?

674
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,428
I'm sewing.

675
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,829
I know you're sewing.

676
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,198
What are you sewing?

677
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,536
Tell me what you're sewing.

678
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,540
Tell me this minute!

679
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,547
Can I help you, sir?

680
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,782
Acme delivery.
This is for Miss Garbo.

681
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,618
There's no one
 here by that name.

682
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,719
I know for a fact that...

683
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,587
There is no one here
 by that name, sir.

684
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,759
Okay, then this is for
 the lady in apartment 10A?

685
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,761
There is no lady in 10A.

686
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,568
You're aware this job
  pays minimum wage?

687
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,970
Yes. I've made my peace
with that.

688
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,271
You supply
 your own uniforms.

689
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,706
No problem.
No problem at all.

690
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,108
You can
 buy Guthrie's clothes.
 You're about the same size.

691
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,209
I'll speak with Guthrie.

692
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,011
Guthrie's dead.
  Oh.

693
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,646
This is a part-time job.
 Yes.

694
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,382
You must be here at 2:45
 for the afternoon deliveries.

695
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,017
Yes, sir.
 2:45, not 3:00.

696
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,519
I understand, sir.

697
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,789
You don't harbor
 any resentment toward the
 upper class, do you, Rolfe?

698
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,059
No.
 Good. We don't
 tolerate rudeness.

699
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,395
There's still a place
 for the rich in New York City.

700
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,032
Excuse me, Mr. Plotkin.

701
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,035
What can I do
 for you, Gilbert?

702
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,704
I would like to
start work earlier,

703
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,072
earlier than 8:30.

704
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,874
I have a job in the afternoon.
 I'd like to leave here
 by 2:00.

705
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,210
Well, we have
 an open start policy.

706
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,411
You can start
 anytime you want to,

707
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,046
as long as you
 put in eight hours.

708
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,715
What time did you
 have in mind?

709
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,351
Well, I would like
 to come in at 7:00.

710
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,287
7:00 to 2:00?
 Yes, sir.

711
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,055
That's seven hours.

712
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,793
I'll make up the difference.
  I'll work on Saturday.

713
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,162
The office is
 closed on Saturday.

714
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,299
I won't take a vacation.

715
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,168
One can't use
 vacation time.
 It's the rule.

716
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,938
You could come in
 at 6:00.

717
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,310
6:00? Nothing's
 working at 6:00.

718
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,145
The computers
 are down at 6:00.

719
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,382
Well, come in, anyway.

720
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,495
Gilbert,
 are you crazy?

721
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,364
I don't believe it.
What's happening to me?

722
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,533
What's happening
 to my life?

723
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,138
I won't come out until
  you take that thing off.

724
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,472
Honey, try and understand.

725
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,941
No. I won't be part
of this circus anymore.

726
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,111
Am I being unfair?

727
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,680
If I'm being unfair,
  just tell me so.

728
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,916
You're not being unfair.

729
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,751
This is too much.

730
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,587
You're making me
  a nervous wreck.

731
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,857
Oh, I'm starting
  to ovulate.

732
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,359
I can feel it.

733
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,230
Now, Mrs. Jacobs
at 51st and Madison,

734
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,633
Mrs. Harrison,
 the same building,
 one floor down.

735
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:13,103
52nd and Park, Mr. Blaustein.
 Double down to 49th,
 the Waldorf.

736
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,538
Miss Moore
 has an apartment there.

737
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,207
We send her biscuits and
 Perrier water every Tuesday.

738
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,042
Jacobs, Harrison,
 Blaustein, Moore.

739
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,811
Always get a signature.
 Don't forget that.

740
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,112
Yes, sir.

741
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,902
Hi.
 Hi.

742
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,804
Oh, hi.

743
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,640
You know,
  I never see you anymore.
  You eat lunch at 10:00.

744
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:26,142
I come in early.
 I need my afternoons free.

745
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,611
Oh.

746
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,146
I'm up for a role.

747
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,481
Oh?
 Yeah.

748
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,750
As You Like It.
 Joe Papp.

749
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,418
Oh.

750
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,988
Good luck.

751
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,990
Thank you.

752
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,361
Well, I'll be
 seeing you, huh?

753
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,935
Krebs on 56th,
 Detweiler on Second and 55th,
 Bluttman, next door, on 55th,

754
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:56,640
Kronhauser on 53rd,
 Cavaleri on 53rd
 and Brown on 50th.

755
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:01,745
Rolfe, this order
 for Brown on 50th...

756
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,080
When you arrive,
 you tell the doorman,

757
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:08,285
"I'm from Fraser-Morris
 and I have the order
 for Brown."

758
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,253
Then you look at him
 and ask,

759
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,422
"Are you from Oslo?"

760
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,657
Do you understand?

761
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,025
Yes, sir.

762
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,193
I say I'm from
  Fraser-Morris and...

763
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,396
No, no.
 You must do it
 exactly as I say it.

764
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,531
I'm sorry.
 "Good afternoon.
 I'm from Fraser-Morris..."

765
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,233
There's no good afternoon.

766
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,368
You say,

767
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,272
"I am from Fraser-Morris
 and I have the order
 for Brown.

768
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,009
"Are you from Oslo?"

769
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,377
You won't get in otherwise.

770
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,179
I'll have to
 send somebody else.
 I don't wanna make two trips!

771
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,480
Yes, sir.

772
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,317
Don't ask me to explain.

773
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,720
One day, maybe,
 when I know you better.

774
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,089
I'm from Fraser-Morris
 and I have the order
 for Brown.

775
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,224
Are you from Oslo?

776
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,527
10B. Service elevator's
 downstairs.

777
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,934
10B.

778
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,904
Miss Garbo,
  Miss Garbo.

779
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,874
Miss Brown, Miss Brown,
please, please.

780
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,410
(MUTTERING)

781
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,373
Fraser-Morris?
 This order's for Miss Brown.

782
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,841
Thank you.
 I'll take it.

783
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,143
You're not Miss Brown.

784
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,211
I work for Miss Brown.

785
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,013
Mr. Morganelli
 told me distinctly

786
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,249
these were to go to
 a Miss Brown and
 no one else.

787
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,452
It's quite all right,
 believe me.

788
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,488
Miss Brown is away.
You'll have
to give them to me.

789
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,624
I'd like to leave
 a note for Miss Brown!

790
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,392
Please!

791
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,970
Rita around the corner
 came to see me today.

792
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,139
She gave me
 a manicure. Look.

793
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,047
Mom, I've been
 trying to find her.

794
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,949
Do you think you will?

795
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,054
I'm doing what I can.
 I can't promise anything.

796
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,392
Give me a kiss.

797
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,500
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

798
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,937
I'm gonna miss you so much.

799
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,040
Mom, don't be afraid.

800
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,414
You know, I'm not afraid.
 I'm mad.

801
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,516
I'm not gonna
get to know

802
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,284
who the next president
  of the United States is.

803
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,986
Me, of all people, hmm?

804
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,622
I got a right to know.

805
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,091
Angelo, this is Gilbert.

806
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,461
I'm fine, thank you.

807
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,331
Angelo, listen,
you have got to help me.

808
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,633
I am desperate.

809
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,169
Yeah, you said
 she goes to an island.

810
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:52,809
Fire Island.
Oh, God, I am so stupid.

811
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,512
I couldn't remember.
 All I could think
 of was Elba.

812
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,949
You still got
 a pulse, Estelle.

813
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,719
What do they pay you?

814
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,788
$7.10 an hour.

815
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,090
How do you live on that?

816
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,859
Oh, got three boyfriends.

817
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,928
Why don't you ask for more?

818
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,897
It's all in the contract.

819
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,899
When's the contract up?

820
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,902
One year, two years.

821
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,104
You wanna keep making
 $7.10 an hour?

822
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,106
Are you kidding?

823
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,575
Nobody's gonna
 change it but you.

824
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,779
Me? I'm Esperanza Gonzales
 from San Juan.

825
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,281
I've got two kids.

826
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:34,684
I live in Queens in
 an apartment with
 my sister.

827
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,719
Who's gonna
 listen to me?

828
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:43,393
Hey, Sanchez?
 Mmm-hmm.

829
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,261
When is our contract up?

830
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,430
What contract?

831
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,666
We've got a contract, stupid.

832
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,407
When is our contract up?

833
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,808
What contract?

834
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,009
Jesus.

835
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,389
The dog is peeing
 on your leg.

838
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,995
Thank you.
Thank you.

Gilbert Rolfe.

841

I'm not gay.

842
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,040
I am.

843
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,643
Guess the whole boat is.

With rare exceptions.

845
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,881
So, what do you do?

846
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,851
I'm an accountant.

847
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,154
I'm working my way up
  from the mailroom at
  Bloomingdale's.

848
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,791
You know,
 that was a joke.

849
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:25,128
Actually,
 I work in the men's
 department at Alexander's.

850
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:29,499
Sometimes I lie,
 I say Bloomingdale's.
 Depends on what crowd I'm in.

851
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,408
This is
my third year
on the island.

852
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,978
The people are friendly.

853
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,315
The older I get,
 the less I care
 about sex.

854
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,917
I'm looking for someone
 I can talk to.

855
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,920
That's hard to find.

856
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,423
What about you?

857
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,558
What about me?

858
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,827
What are you looking for?

859
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,929
We're all looking
  for something.

860
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,001
You're not gonna
 believe me.

861
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,439
I'm looking
  for Greta Garbo.

862
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,376
You're looking for
 the Garbo?

863
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,111
Mmm-hmm.

864
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,581
Is this a joke?

865
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,649
No.

866
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,618
Mind if I ask why?

867
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,288
It's a long story.

868
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,823
It's gotta be.

869
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,828
I saw her once last summer
 walking along the beach.

870
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:35,898
She was wearing
 a big hat and sunglasses

871
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:38,001
and a long, flowing cape.

872
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,237
Yeah, she was...
 She was walking along

873
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,107
in a light rain
 without an umbrella.

874
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,310
I don't think anybody
 even knew who she was.

875
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,581
But then, all of a sudden,
 she just disappeared into
 a house

876
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,050
and I never
 saw her again.

877
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,986
Excuse me. Would you
 remember the house?

878
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,457
It was along here
 somewhere.

879
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,626
I didn't take
that good a look.

880
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,795
Please, it is
very important.

881
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,968
Would you have dinner
 with me tonight?

882
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,204
I'm sorry, I can't.

883
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,407
I just hate to eat alone.

884
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,641
So does my mother.

885
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,777
She goes to a restaurant,

886
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,645
she looks to see
  if someone else
  is alone.

887
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:26,082
If they look interesting,
 she asks them if she can
 join them.

888
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,651
And what if they say no?

889
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:30,753
She'll ask someone else.

890
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,556
One rejection,
 I lose my appetite.

891
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,892
It might've been
  that one there.

892
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,535
You mind if I ask you
 a question?

893
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,107
Why are you
 looking for Garbo?

894
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,877
My mother wants to meet her.

895
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,380

896
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,248
Yeah.

897
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,751
I thought you were doing it
for an autograph.

898
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,453
Good.

899
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,860
What about the pants?

900
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:13,062
A present.

901
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:20,403
Look, if your mother
 ever wants to meet me,

902
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,407
I'm at the Queens
Boulevard branch.

905

There is nobody here
 of that name.

This is the

I have got to talk to her.
 There is no Garbo here.

 call to say you

 another woman in

No.

Are you sure?

01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,317
What?

932
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,087
I said,
 are you sure there's not
 another woman in your life?

933

I'm sure.

 She didn't recognize me.

I couldn't tell if it
 was intentional or not.

940

Gillie, I spoke
 to my mother and Dad.

941

They're concerned about me.

942
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,594
They want me to come home.

943
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,165
Dad offered to come here
 and get me and take me back.

 isn't necessary.

 I wouldn't come until...

 but I do try.

You don't have
 to try anymore.

 why don't you just leave?

01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,700
I'll tell you something.

955
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,102
When Mom first met you,

956
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,304
she said
  you were affected,
  you were pretentious.

957
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,539
She didn't like you. She...

958
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,208
What did she say?

959
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,712
What?

960
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,447
I told her
  you spoke two languages.

961
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,883
She said, "Yes.
  English and Gucci."

962
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,385
The feeling's mutual.

963
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,562
My parents have never been
 so embarrassed in their
 whole lives.

964
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:56,265
Your mother wouldn't cross
 a picket line for her own
 son's wedding.

965
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,433
You gonna go through
 this again?

966
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,401
The bartender's union
 was striking the Beverly...

967
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,704
We offered to get her
  into the laundry room,
  but she wouldn't budge.

968
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,239
She does not
 cross picket lines.

969
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:04,640
Her own son's wedding.

970
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,575
That is the way she is.

971
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:15,050
I'll come back,
 if you want me to.

972
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,987
I think
 it's better this way.

973
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,059

974

We had a perfect marriage.

975

All I wanted was a home,
 children and security,
 but...

976

 one surprise after another.

977

I don't want
surprises, Gillie.

I paid the difference.

980

 to think I was a schmuck.

01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,075
Then look it up in
  your player's guide.

1113
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,121
Yes?
 Mr. Goldhammer?

1114
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:22,023
Yes.
 How do you do?
 I'm Marian Lane.

1115
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:26,795
Who?
 We met at the Tony Awards.

1116
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,064
Oh, I haven't been to
 the Tonys, not in years.

1117
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,367
It was some time ago,
  but, oh, I remember you.

1118
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,537
Why, you're the backbone
  of this organization,
  as I recall.

1119
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,539
Most people don't know
 I exist.

1120
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,508
Oh, I certainly do.

1121
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,776
You're one
  of those people

1122
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,711
that you can never
  quite get out of
  your mind.

1123
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:44,946
Thank you.

1124
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,782
Our phones are out.
 I'm working for
 Jimmy Nederlander now,

1125
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,619
and he needs
 some information
 on Elizabeth Rennick.

1126
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,258
Nobody's called for
 Elizabeth Rennick
 in 15 years.

1127
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,494
It's going
 to be the chance
 of a lifetime for her.

1128
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,130
She's very old.

1129
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:05,167
Mr. Goldhammer, what
  a sense of humor
  you have.

1130
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,438
Her number.

1131
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:21,383
(PHONE RINGS)

1132
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:24,386
ELIZABETH ON
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello.
This is Elizabeth Rennick.

1133
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:28,190
555-8318.
 I am not at home.

1134
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:31,193
I'm rehearsing a new
 production of Romeo
 and Juliet

1135
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,795
in which I've been
cast as the nurse.

1136
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,531
I turned
 the part down
 several times

1137
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,734
'cause I...
 Well, I don't do
 supporting roles,

1138
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:43,238
but Joe Papp, the brilliant
  producer of A Chorus Line,

1139
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:48,376
kept calling back
  and finally, I said,
  "Okay, I'll give it a try."

1140
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:52,147
We're at
 the Delacorte Theater in
 Central Park for rehearsals,

1141
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,683
which I expect won't
 take more than two weeks,

1142
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:57,285
if everyone
  behaves professionally.

1143
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,855
Sometimes these
off-Broadway companies

1144
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,924
are a bunch of animals,
  smoking dope,

1145
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:06,328
and everyone trying to
get into everyone's pants.

1146
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:10,465
No one cares
  about Shakespeare,
  but if all goes well...

1147
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,445
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Elizabeth Rennick.
 (SHUSHING)

1148
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:26,414
MAN: Miss Rennick, we're
ready for your scene again.

1149
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,918
Miss Rennick!

1150
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,356
Stand over here.

1151
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:36,992
That's it.

1152
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,393
Right here.

1153
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,631
Fine. Good. Good.

1154
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,602
Okay,

1155
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:50,071
and please
 try not to wobble!

1156
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,308
Nurse, where's my daughter?

1157
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,744
Call her forth to me.

1158
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:58,613
Now, by my
 maidenhair...

1159
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:03,151
Maidenhead,
Miss Rennick,
not maidenhair!

1160
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,686
I want to
 cut that line.

1161
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,454
We can't cut it.

1162
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,157
She's been making
 that same mistake
 all week.

1163
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,759
You can't
 remember your lines!

1164
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,294
I forget my lines once!

1165
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,696
You remembered them once!

1166
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,165
It's not working!

1167
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,937
All right, everybody,
lunch, one hour!

1168
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,539
Miss Rennick, please,
 I need your help.

1169
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,341
Are you and
 she still friends?
 Do you ever see her...

1170
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:30,145
I never should've
 lent my name to
 this fiasco.

1171
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,247
Yes. Miss Rennick,
 would you call her for me?

1172
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,816
Call who?
  What are you
  talking about?

1173
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:36,518
Garbo.

1174
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,386
Miss Garbo.

1175
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,890
Yes. She gave me this ring.

1176
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,359
It's real gold.

1177
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,661
Oh, it was
 very generous of her.

1178
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,998
Well, considering that
she still has the
first nickel

1179
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,967
which she ever made.

1180
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,503
You know
  the flea market
  on Sixth Avenue?

1181
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,673
Well, you might
look for her there.

1182
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,343
She always
  loved a bargain.

1183
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,182
(GASPS) You're...

1184
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,618
I'm sorry.

1185
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,690
That's solid sterling.

1186
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,959
$175.

1187
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,094
MAN: Hey,
 did you see her?
 Did you see her?

1188
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,741
WOMAN: Isn't that...

1189
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,710
MAN: I don't know.
 I think it is.

1190
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,378
(CHATTERING)

1191
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,400
Can I have a minute
 of your time, please?

1192
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,704
I'm not a reporter
 or anything.

1193
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,739
It's about my mother.

1194
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:49,310
You've gotta
 listen to me, please.
 My mother is very sick.

1195
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:52,714
She is
 at New York Hospital,
 room 808. She has a tumor.

1196
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:56,918
She doesn't
 have much time.
 She has no time.

1197
01:25:56,951 --> 01:26:00,421
The doctor
 does not think
 she will last the week.

1198
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:04,125
She has this crazy wish.
 She wants to meet you.

1199
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,395
I have been
 looking for you
 for three months.

1200
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:12,133
She just wants to see you
 before she dies, that's all.

1201
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:16,704
She just
 wants to look at you.
 I don't know, just see you.

1202
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:22,110
Please.
 Please come with me.

1203
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,112
Just a few minutes,
 that's all.

1204
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,448
Five minutes. One minute.

1205
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,386
Please. There's not
 even time to think
 about it.

1206
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,122
She loves you so.

1207
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,526
She loves you,
 maybe even more than me.

1208
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:05,520
That's her.

1209
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,905
I can't believe it.

1210
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,276
It's really you.

1211
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,719
It's you.
  If I'd have
  known, I would've...

1212
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,155
I would've
 had my hair done,

1213
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:16,624
had somebody
give me a manicure.

1214
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,369
You met my son?

1215
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,541
He's a good boy.
He works very hard.

1216
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:50,124
I don't know what to say.

1217
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,028
I mean, you're here,
  I don't have words.

1218
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,965
Must be 30, 40 years.

1219
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:02,804
Oh, I bet people
  have told you this till
  you're blue in the face.

1220
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,641
I've loved you ever since
 the first time I ever
 saw you.

1221
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,110
We were living
on Eastern Parkway,
that's in Brooklyn.

1222
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,145
My father
gave me 10 cents
to go to the movies

1223
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,715
with Wanda Sternhagen,
 my girlfriend.

1224
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,618
My father
 didn't have much.

1225
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:21,756
Ten cents was
 a lot of money to him.
 He had six mouths to feed.

1226
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,726
We saw
 Flesh and the Devil.

1227
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:29,897
Your name was Felicitas
  von Kletzingk, remember?

1228
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:32,366
What a name.
  I never forgot it.
  It stuck in my head.

1229
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,336
You know, movie names
 don't usually stick
 in your head.

1230
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:39,674
There I was
 in the balcony of
 the Loew's Pitkin,

1231
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:47,915
with Wanda Sternhagen
 in Brooklyn and I was
 Estelle Garbo,

1232
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,517
eating a corned-beef
  sandwich

1233
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:54,021
out of a brown paper bag
  and Wanda kept saying,
  "Shh,"

1234
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,858
because the brown paper bag
kept rattling.

1235
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,361
It's easy
being Estelle Garbo

1236
01:30:00,394 --> 01:30:03,464
when you're in the balcony
 of the Loew's Pitkin
 in the dark.

1237
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:05,867
Nobody could see my
double chin and my
huge bust.

1238
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,503
Not like yours. Nice.

1239
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,038
I shouldn't have been
 eating a corned-beef
 sandwich, anyway.

1240
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,141
I was a fat kid.
 I needed to
 lose some weight,

1241
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:16,778
but show me anything
from a delicatessen,
especially corned-beef.

1242
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:23,851
You had me in
the palm of your hands.

1243
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,522
Every time you moved,
 I sighed.

1244
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,892
You walked from one end
 of the room to the other,

1245
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,060
it was as if your feet
 never touched the ground.

1246
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,998
Wanda and I saw
 every movie you ever made.

1247
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:40,334
She thought I loved you
  because I had big feet, too.

1248
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,871
It's true.
  I wore size 10.

1249
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:46,240
I was only going on
12 years old.

1250
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:49,477
Wanda moved away.

1251
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,014
Her father got a job
  in Trenton.

1252
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,049
Before she left, I took
 her to lunch and a movie.

1253
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,218
We went to
 see a revival
 of Wild Orchids.

1254
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:58,452
We sat through it
 four times

1255
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,955
because we didn't know
 how to say goodbye
 to each other.

1256
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,492
I wrote you
 a letter once.

1257
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,628
I never wrote to
 any other movie star.

1258
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,564
I didn't get an answer.

1259
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,733
That's all right.
 That's all right.

1260
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:14,869
I didn't take it
  personally.

1261
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,640
You know, you're not gonna
  believe this, but it's true.

1262
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:22,009
I married my husband
 in 1953.

1263
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:23,978
It was a small wedding.
It was in the house.

1264
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:26,180
My mother
 cooked for a week.
 My aunt cooked for a week.

1265
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:28,249
Everybody came.

1266
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:31,385
Then, afterwards,
Walter and I took the
train to Atlantic City.

1267
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,288
That was
our honeymoon.
Some honeymoon.

1268
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:38,526
Two nights. I didn't
  plan things right,
  you know?

1269
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,528
Female times.

1270
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:44,866
So there
we were in Atlantic City
and I couldn't do anything.

1271
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:47,969
I was a virgin.
  Walter was a virgin.

1272
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:51,272
We had to
 stay that way
 a little while longer.

1273
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,140
We didn't have
  anything to do.

1274
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,945
So, I bought a newspaper.
Anna Christie was playing.

1275
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:02,850
It was the only movie
of yours I hadn't seen.

1276
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,786
Garbo talks.

1277
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:12,393
"Give me a whiskey.
Ginger ale on the side.

1278
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:15,363
"And don't be stingy, baby."

1279
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:20,501
Walter and I had Gilbert.

1280
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:23,604
I named him
 for John Gilbert.

1281
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,907
When I came out
 of the delivery,

1282
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:30,411
I was so exhausted,
  I could hardly move.

1283
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:33,114
I could
hardly even open
my eyes. The TV was on.

1284
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,882
They were playing Camille,
and all I kept looking at

1285
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:37,251
were those
 heavy skirts of yours

1286
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,687
going back and forth
  and back and forth

1287
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,223
and back and forth.

1288
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,194
Walter and I
 got a divorce.

1289
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:52,600
World's a crazy place
  to live in, isn't it?

1290
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,735
He thought
 I was eccentric.

1291
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:59,574
Day I came home from the
 lawyer's, I cried all day.

1292
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,543
I walked around the house
 all day. I couldn't find
 a place to sit.

1293
01:33:02,576 --> 01:33:04,312
I took three baths.

1294
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:06,714
I don't know.

1295
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:08,649
You love somebody,

1296
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:10,051
you have a child,

1297
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,053
and then it's over.

1298
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:14,989
Why? I don't know.

1299
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:18,693
It's crazy.
  I turned on the TV.

1300
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:21,295
They were playing
  Queen Christina.

1301
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:24,165
That close-up
 of you at the end,
 I thought it would never end.

1302
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:26,801
I mean, it just
 went on and on and on.

1303
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:29,837
Oh, God, how I hated you.

1304
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:33,274
I really hated myself.

1305
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:36,377
I thought
 if I looked like you,

1306
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,113
if I had that face,
 if I had those eyes,

1307
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,017
I wouldn't be so alone.

1308
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:46,420
And those arms of yours,

1309
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,056
those long, thin arms
that go on and on
and on forever

1310
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,525
like as if they're never
 gonna end.

1311
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:55,863
I would've been jealous
of anybody pretty that day.

1312
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,501
Just your luck they were
 playing Queen Christina.

1313
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,806
You care anything
about basketball?

1314
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:08,909
The Knicks are
  out of the playoffs.

1315
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,345
I'm not entirely
happy about that.

1316
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,982
World is full of
 little injustices.

1317
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:17,618
They either bother you,
 or they don't.

1318
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:20,688
Me, they bother.

1319
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:23,457
You know, a couple years ago,
 I saw a picture of you in
 a magazine.

1320
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,693
You were in Paris.

1321
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:28,996
You were walking in a park
 in a black hat.

1322
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,165
I bet you got
  a million hats.

1323
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,969
I went to Paris. Twice.

1324
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,172
You got nothing on me there.

1325
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:43,611
Of course,
 you were with
 Aristotle Onassis.

1326
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:46,180
And I was with
the B'nai B'rith tour.

1327
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:13,941
Oh, Gilbert.
 Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert.

1328
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:18,479
Oh, God, Gilbert!

1329
01:35:18,512 --> 01:35:20,881
You know what she told me?

1330
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:23,451
She told me that
 her father was very
 poor, just like mine.

1331
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,786
He worked in
 a factory in Sweden.

1332
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,488
He made auto parts.

1333
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:31,025
And she loves delicatessen,

1334
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:34,361
only she likes cold chicken
 better than corned-beef.

1335
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:38,766
And what else?

1336
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,669
Oh, she hated biology.
 She hated biology.

1337
01:35:41,702 --> 01:35:43,904
And, God,
 how I hated biology.

1338
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:47,842
And I can't remember
 everything else she told me.

1339
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,912
We had such a good talk,
 Gilbert.

1340
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,481
She told me that
 she was born in September.

1341
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:56,050
I was born in September,
 you know that, don't you?

1342
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,119
And she told me that
 her living room is red.

1343
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:00,321
Her living room
is red, Gilbert.

1344
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:02,890
And what else? What else?
 What else?

1345
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,925
Her living room is red
 and she hates war.

1346
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,695
She hates anything
 about war and violence.

1347
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:12,066
Damn it.
 But anyway, she said
 that we were very much alike.

1348
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:19,240
Except for the feet. You know
 she hasn't got big feet
 at all.

1349
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:23,144
She wears size 7AA.
 She showed them to me.

1350
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:27,815
Well, she sure got it
 all over me there.

1351
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,121
I'm very busy now, Gilbert.

1352
01:37:41,155 --> 01:37:42,823
I have to talk to you,
 Mr. Plotkin.

1353
01:37:42,856 --> 01:37:44,892
Later, Gilbert.

1354
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:47,027
I have to
 talk with you now.

1355
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:53,667
Shepard, I'm leaving.

1356
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:58,639
I am not saying this
  because I am upset.

1357
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:01,976
But yes, I am upset.
  Of course I'm upset.

1358
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:03,611
I am very upset.

1359
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:06,213
You took my office away

1360
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:09,617
and you gave me
 a depressing little room.

1361
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:14,255
It's not your fault.
I allowed it to happen.

1362
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:16,891
The light fixture buzzes.

1363
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:20,327
There's a dull hum
all day long. You know.

1364
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:24,331
You wouldn't fix it for me,
no matter how many times
I asked. It's okay.

1365
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:26,867
You reduced the staff,

1366
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:30,070
and you
gave me enough work
for three people to do.

1367
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:34,708
And if I didn't finish,
I got that speech about
consolidating my time.

1368
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:38,412
Don't worry about it.
It is not your problem.

1369
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:40,514
I sat there
and I listened.

1370
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:42,449
Didn't I?

1371
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:46,153
You deducted a half-day's
 salary because I was late.

1372
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:52,026
No problem.
I allowed it to happen.

1373
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:55,729
You made me
  come to work at
  6:00 in the morning.

1374
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:59,199
There was nothing to do
at 6:00 in the morning
and I said to myself,

1375
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:02,469
I said, "Plotkin is
enjoying doing this
to me."

1376
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:07,041
But then I said,
 "No. Rules are rules.

1377
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:08,976
"The man is
only doing his job.

1378
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:12,680
"That's okay.
  A man has to
  do his job."

1379
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:17,484
You've been great.
 You really have.

1380
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:21,021
I wish you
 the best of luck.

1381
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:24,425
I'm not angry.
 I have no resentment.

1382
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,293
You've been great.

1383
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:28,195
But we are who we are.

1384
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:30,197
I am who I am.

1385
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,765
You are who you are.

1386
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:34,468
So, go fuck yourself,
 Shepard.

1387
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:39,840
(DOOR CLOSES)

1388
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:41,241
JANE: I got the part.

1389
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:42,609
GILBERT: Yeah? Great.
  Yeah.

1390
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,445
They kept
 calling me back
 and calling me back.

1391
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:45,946
I thought they'd never
 make up their mind.

1392
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,048
Great. Great,
 great, great.

1393
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:49,550
I quit.

1394
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:51,018
You quit? You, too?

1395
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,587
Yes. I can do better.

1396
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,456
I think I can do
  a lot better.

1397
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,990
What are you
gonna look for now?

1398
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,626
I don't know.

1399
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:01,862
The sky's the limit,
  though.

1400
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:04,898
I'd like you to
 come to opening night.

1401
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,667
Sure.

1402
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,169
They're going
 to talk about my
 Rosalind for years.

1403
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:12,439
I'm going
 to be the best Rosalind
 that anyone has ever seen.

1404
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,378
You already are.

1405
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:21,815
Gilbert, you're
  not part of my world.
  My career consumes me.

1406
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,484
I mean, there's just
 no time for a relationship.

1407
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:24,585
You understand that,
 don't you?

1408
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:25,986
Oh, sure.
  Good.

1409
01:40:26,019 --> 01:40:27,488
I mean, maybe
I'm denying myself,

1410
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,623
but, boy, acting is
  so full of sacrifice.

1411
01:40:29,656 --> 01:40:31,759
Every day, I give up
  something for my art.

1412
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,195
You're simpatico.
 I really like that.

1413
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,498
Oh, I'm famous
 for my simpatico.

1414
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:40,100
(LAUGHS)

1415
01:40:40,134 --> 01:40:43,437
I don't know
 what it is about you,
 but you make me laugh.

1416
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,240
You're so off-center.
 I love it.

1417
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:51,945
Oh, my God. Gilbert,
 do you know who that is?

1418
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,282
Oh, it's Greta Garbo.

1419
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:04,491
Oh, my God,
 she's coming this way.

1420
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:11,365
Oh, Gilbert,
 I can't look, I can't.

1421
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,437
How do you do,
 Gilbert?

1422
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:19,072
I'm fine,
  thank you.

1423
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:24,711
I don't believe it.

1424
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:30,884
Gilbert, you are
something else.
