I want you to concentrate.

9

I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

10
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,847
Square.

All right. Tell me
what you think it is.

00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,876
Is it a star?

16
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:26,708
It is a star. Very good.
That's great.

17
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,626
Okay. All right.

18
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,802
Think hard. What is it?

19
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,466
Circle.

20
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:40,558
Close. But definitely wrong.

- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:49,814
All right.

25
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,154
What is it?

26
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,870
Come on.

27
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,998
Figure eight.

Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

Okay.

- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

You only have 75 more to
go, okay? What's this one?

33
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,227
It's a couple of wavy lines.

34
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:33,194
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

I'm getting a little tired of this!

39
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,911
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying you, aren't we?

40
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:49,331
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna be giving me electric shocks!

41
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,546
What are you trying to
prove here, anyway?

42
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:55,679
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

43
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:59,307
The effect? I'll tell you what the
effect is. It's pissing me off!

44
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,309
Well, then maybe my
theory is correct!

45
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:05,268
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister!

46
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,945
You may as well get used to that.

47
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:16,863
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability is going to provoke in some people.

48
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:20,287
Do you think I have it,
Dr. Venkman?

49

You're no fluke, Jennifer.

50
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,710
This is it. This is definitely it!

51
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:29,246
Did those UV lenses come
in for the video camera?

52
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,962
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

53
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:36,253
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

54
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,932
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

55
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,811
I need a little more
time with this subject.

56
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,429
Could you come back in an
hour, hour and a half?

57
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,597
Peter, at 1:40 p.m.

58
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:51,189
at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue,

59
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,073
ten people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

60
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:58,404
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away

61
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,945
and scared the socks off
some poor librarian.

62
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

63
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:07,413
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

64
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:10,420
No, Peter, you're coming with us on
this one. Spengler went down there.

65
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,628
He took PKE valences, went right
off the top of the scale.

66
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,136
Buried the needle. We're close
on this one. I can feel it.

67
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,727
I can feel it. We're
very, very close.

68
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:29,932
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

69
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,271
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say at...?

70
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,811
Eight o'clock?

71
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:38,858
I was just going to say, "8:00?"
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

72
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,245
As a friend, I have to tell you,

73
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,130
you've finally gone around the
bend on this ghost business.

74

You guys have been
running your ass off,

75
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,900
meeting and greeting every
schizo in the five boroughs

76
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:53,105
who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

77
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,389
Of course, you forget, Peter,

78
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,943
I was present at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

79
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:03,257
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

tried to drill a hole through your head.

Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

I don't remember seeing any legs,

91
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:42,049
but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

Arms? I can't wait to get
a look at this thing.

Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

94
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,803
Have you or any
member of your family

95
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,066
ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

96
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,986
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

97
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,944
I'd call that a big yes.

98
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:06,408
Uh, are you habitually using
drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

99
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,869
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

100
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,540
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

101
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:18,879
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

- Symmetrical book-stacking.

According to these new readings,
I think we have an excellent chance

158
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,650
of actually catching a ghost
and holding it indefinitely.

159
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:54,817
Well, this is great. If the ionization rate
is constant for all ectoplasmic entities,

160
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:58,203
we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

161
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,365
Spengs, you serious about
this catching a ghost?

162
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,454
I'm always serious.

163
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:07,667
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of
the things I've said about you.

164
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,299
You... You've earned it.

165
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:18,507
The possibilities are limitless.
Hey, Dean Yeager.

166
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,645
I trust you're moving us to
better quarters on campus.

167
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,898
No, you're being moved off campus.

168
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,730
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

169
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:32,736
You are to vacate these
premises immediately.

170
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,899
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

171
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:39,069
Fine. This university
will no longer continue

172
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:42,580
any funding of any kind for
your group's activities.

173
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,412
But the kids love us.

174
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:50,707
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

175
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:55,423
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

176
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:58,004
Your theories are the worst
kind of popular tripe.

177
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,516
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

178
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,144
You are a poor scientist,
Dr. Venkman.

179
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,767
I see.

180
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,777
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

181
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,193
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

182
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,779
They wouldn't touch us with
a 10-meter cattle prod.

183
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,285
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

184
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,288
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent clerk.

185
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,290
- You know how much a patent clerk earns?
- No

186
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,801
Personally, I like the university.
They gave us money and facilities.

187
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,149
We didn't have to produce anything.

188
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,238
You've never been out of college. You
don't know what it's like out there.

189
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,764
I've worked in the private
sector. They expect results.

190
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,969
For whatever reasons, Ray,

191
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,222
call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma,

192
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,228
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

193
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,483
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

194
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:56,654
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

195
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,064
This ecto-containment system that
Spengler and I have in mind is gonna

196
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:07,186
require a load of bread to capitalize.
Where are we gonna get the money?

197
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,500
I don't know. I don't know.

198
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,750
You're never gonna
regret this, Ray.

199
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,510
My parents left me that
house. I was born there.

200
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:22,923
You're not gonna lose the house.
Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

201
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,763
But at 19 percent? You didn't
even bargain with the guy.

202
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,428
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone

203
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,347
for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

204
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:34,518
Will you guys relax? We are on
the threshold of establishing

205
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,774
the indispensable defense
science of the next decade:

206
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,532
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

207
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:46,363
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

208
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,703
REALTOR: There's office space, sleeping
quarters and showers on the next floor

209
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,516
and there's a full kitchen
on the top level.

210
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,544
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

211
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,545
What do you think, Egon?

212
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,968
I think this building
should be condemned.

213
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,676
There's serious metal fatigue in
all the load-bearing members.

214
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:07,468
The wiring is substandard. It's completely
inadequate for our power needs.

215
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,557
And the neighborhood is
like a demilitarized zone.

216
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,644
Hey, does this pole still work?

217
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,738
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

218
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,902
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

219
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,285
Hey, we should stay here tonight,
sleep here. You know, to try it out.

220
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:45,263
- I think we'll take it.
- Good.

No, no, I'm fine. I feel great.

227
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,144
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

228
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,980
I taped <i>20-Minute Workout</i> on my
machine and played it back at high speed

229
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,315
so it only took 10 minutes.
I got a great workout.

230
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,279
- Good.
- Want to come in for a mineral water?

231
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,651
Oh, I'd really like to, Louis, but I have
to go to rehearsal now. Excuse me.

232
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:49,986
No sweat. I'll take a
rain check on that.

233

mineral water and other

nutritious foods in the house.
But you already know that.

235
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,867
- Yeah, I know that.
- Listen, that reminds me...

236
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,940
I'm having a big party
for all my clients.

237
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,921
It's my fourth anniversary
as an accountant, you know.

And even though you do your own tax
return, which you shouldn't do,

239
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,025
I'd like you to stop by, being
that you're my neighbor and all.

240
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:07,254
Well, thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

241
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,655
Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't
leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

242
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,758
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

243
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,098
That's strange. I didn't
realize I left it on.

244
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,105
Oh, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on
the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable

245
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,689
but I couldn't get in, so you know what
I did? I turned up my TV real loud too

246
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:25,192
so everyone would think that both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do,

309

this, which often bring us results.

310
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,465
Well, I could go to Hall of Records and check
out the structural details in the building.

311
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,718
Maybe the building itself has a
history of psychic turbulence.

That's the bedroom. But nothing
ever happened in there.

- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

338
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:48,092
See I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells

339
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,849
- and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

340
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:55,138
And that's when I started to hear that
awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

341
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,651
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?

342
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:05,481
Better check the fridge. Good call.

- You actually eat this stuff?

346
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,038
Look, this wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

347
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:24,835
There was a space and there was a building
or something with flames coming out of it.

348
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,721
And there were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

349
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,674
And there were flames, and I
heard a voice say, "Zuul."

350
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,183
It was right here.

getting any reading.

I think so. But I'm sure there
are no animals in there.

354
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:44,069
Well, that's great.

355
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:47,823
Either I have a monster in my
kitchen, or I'm completely crazy.

356
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,325
I don't think you're crazy.

Oh, good. That makes
me feel so much better.

358
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:57,871
Let me tell you
something about myself.

359
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:01,162
I come home from work to my
place, and all I have is my work.

360
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,875
- There's nothing else in my life.
- Dr. Venkman.

361
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:07,339
I meet you, and I say, "My God, there's
someone with the same problem I have."

362
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:10,345
Yes, we both have the
same problem. You.

363
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:16,222
I'm gonna go for broke.

364
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,766
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

365
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,523
Will you please leave?

366
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:28,068
And then she threw me out of her
life. She thought I was a creep.

367
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,234
She thought I was a geek, and
she probably wasn't the first.

368
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,698
You are so odd.

369
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:40,083
- No.
- I've got it!

370
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,041
- No, no, no, no
- I'll prove myself to you.

- Okay.

373

And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done."

374
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,922
- "I wonder what makes him tick."
- I wonder.

375
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:57,093
"I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick."

Save some for me.</i>

<i>Get down here, right away!
It just went into a ballroom.</i>

459
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,747
Okay, we'll be right there.

460
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:44,333
Okay, sir, if you and your staff
could please wait out here,

461
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,843
we'll take care of everything.

(DOOR LOCKS)

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,773
There it is. On the ceiling.

464
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,531
That's the one that got me.

465
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,461
All right, boys.

466
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,372
Ready?

467
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,881
Throw it!

468
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:35,884
I did that. I did that.

469
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:38,725
- That's my fault.
- It's okay. The table broke the fall.

470
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,723
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

471
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,234
- What?
- Don't cross the streams.

472
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,024
- Why?
- It would be bad.

473
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,782
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing.
What do you mean, "bad"?

474
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,174
Try to imagine all life as you
know it stopping instantaneously

00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,581
and every molecule in your body
exploding at the speed of light.

476
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,579
Total protonic reversal.

477
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:03,666
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

478
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:08,254
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

(GULPING)

480
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,426
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

481
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,344
Ray!

482
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:23,477
Egon!

483
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,274
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

484
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

485
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,325
Nice shooting, Tex!

486
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,786
I assure you, Mrs. Van Houten,
there is no problem with the room.

487
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,293
It'll be ready promptly on time as
soon as your guests are with us.

488
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,545
The last throw took something out
of him, but he's gonna move.

489
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,628
I need some room to put the
trap down. Give me some room.

490
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,710
You'll excuse me, please.

491
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:01,178
- Gotta get this in the clear.
- Wait, wait, wait!

492
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,972
I've always wanted to do this.

493
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,686
And...

494
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:08,728
- The flowers are still standing!
- Okay, on my go-signal.

495
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,147
Spengler, I want a confinement
stream from you, okay? Go!

496
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:15,066
Okay, hold him up there. He's
gonna move. Hold him up!

497
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,655
Go!

498
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:20,329
- It's working, Ray.
- Start bringing him down.

499
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:22,240
You got him. Don't
cross the stream.

500
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:26,583
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

501
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:30,124
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

502
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,335
All right, I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

503
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,092
I looked at the trap, Ray.

504
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:40,680
Turn your streams off as soon as I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

505
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,765
Now!

506
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,622
It's in there.

507
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,408
Hey.

508
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,162
Well, that wasn't such
a chore, now, was it?

509
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:13,212
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

510
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,172
Donald, stand over there.

511
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,547
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

512
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,135
Did you see it? What is it?

513
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,641
We got it.

514
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,802
What is it? Will there
be any more of them?

515
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,892
Sir, what you had there was
what we refer to as a focused,

516
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:30,810
non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

517
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,693
Real nasty one too.

518
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:34,695
And now,

519
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:37,478
let's talk seriously. Now,
for the entrapment...

520
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:40,761
we're gonna have to ask you for
four big ones, $4000 for that.

521
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:45,582
But we are having a special this week on
proton charging and storage of the beast.

522
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,243
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

523
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:52,004
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

524
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,398
That's all right. We can just
put it right back in there.

525
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,376
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

526
00:38:56,443 --> 00:39:00,093
No! All right! Anything.

527
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:01,598
Thanks so much.

528
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,554
Thank you. Hope we
can help you again.

- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

596
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,330
What's that word?

597
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,086
- "Hittites."
- Hittites,

598
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:49,344
the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

599
00:43:50,153 --> 00:43:52,722
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

600
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,099
What's Gozer?

601
00:43:55,158 --> 00:43:59,479
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

602
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,641
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night,

00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:06,152
I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

I respect you.

</i> and we'll eat and read.

- He's just a friend.

- An old friend.

Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

616

I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

617

You're still very pale,

This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

621

Insert the trap.

622

the trap is clean.

Dr. Venkman.

643
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,248
Exactly what are you a
doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

644
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:31,836
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in

And now you catch ghosts.

Yeah. You could say that.

648
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:42,638
And how many ghosts have
you caught, Mr. Venkman?

649
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,474
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put

650
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,515
these ghosts once you catch them?

651
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:51,146
Into a storage facility.

652
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:54,646
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

653
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:59,488
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

654
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,029
No. And why not, Mr. Venkman?

655
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:07,826
Because you did not
use the magic word.

656
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:13,752
What is the magic
word, Mr. Venkman?

657
00:47:14,982 --> 00:47:16,425
"Please."

658
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:21,548
May I please see the storage
facility, Mr. Venkman?

659
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:23,424
Why do you want to see
the storage facility?

660
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:25,680
Well, because I'm curious.

00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:28,266
I want to know more
about what you do here.

662
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,269
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media

663
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:35,861
and we want to assess any possible
environmental impact from your operation.

664
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,068
For instance, the
presence of noxious,

665
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:41,526
possibly hazardous waste
chemicals in your basement.

666
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,913
Now, you either show me what is down
there, or I come back with a court order.

667
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:51,002
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution!

668
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:54,539
You can have it your
way, Mr. Venkman.

669

I'm worried, Ray. It's
getting crowded in there,

something big on the horizon.

What do you mean "big"?

represents the normal amount

in the New York area.

674

760
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:24,747
Hi, I'm going up to
Dana Barrett's. Okay.

761
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,877
(CHATTERING)

762
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:45,513
Hello?

763
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,560
That's a different look
for you, isn't it?

764
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:52,770
Are you the Keymaster?

765
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,654
Not that I know of.

766
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,617
Are you the Keymaster?

767
00:56:10,684 --> 00:56:12,127
Yes.

768
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,464
I'm a friend of his. He
told me to meet him here.

769
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:18,672
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul.

770
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:21,007
I am the Gatekeeper.

771
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,842
Oh.

772
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:25,181
(♪♪)

773
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,647
- What are we doing today, Zuul?
- Must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

774
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:33,978
Gozer, huh?

775
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,810
The Destructor.

776
00:56:44,927 --> 00:56:46,370
Are we still going out?

777
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:53,084
You know, you could pick up the
place if you're expecting someone.

778
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,668
Do you want this body?

779
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:58,799
Is this a trick question?

780
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:04,680
I guess the roses worked, huh?

781
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:06,886
Take me now,

782
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:08,676
sub-creature.

783
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:10,685
We never talk anymore.

784
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:16,810
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

785
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:20,862
Actually, it's more of a
guideline than a rule.

786
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:22,443
You know, I can...

787
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,029
I want you inside me.

788
00:57:26,218 --> 00:57:27,945
Go ahead. No, I can't.

789
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,830
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

790
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,832
Might be a little crowded.

791
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:35,244
Come on, why don't
you just quit trying

792
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,539
to upset and disturb
Dr. Venkman and just relax.

793
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,255
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

794
00:57:42,317 --> 00:57:45,261
What I'd really like
to do is talk to Dana.

795
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,297
I want to talk to Dana.

796
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,886
Dana, it's Peter.

797
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:52,770
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

798
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,893
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Now, come on.

799
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,816
Come on, I want to
talk to Dana. Dana.

800
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,353
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

801
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:02,396
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

802
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:06,317
(IN DEMONIC VOICE)
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

803
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:09,077
What a lovely singing
voice you must have.

804
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:11,238
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

805
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:12,998
And if I don't talk to Dana...

806
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,869
there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

807
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:18,457
One.

808
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,213
(GROWLING)

809
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,504
Two.

810
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,757
Two and a half.

811
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:11,181
Please come down.

812
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:12,970
(ROARS)

813
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:18,352
I am the Keymaster. The
Destructor is coming.

814
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,524
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

815
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,401
(PANTING)

816
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,322
(HORSE NEIGHS)

817
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,449
Gatekeeper.

818
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:36,498
I am Vinz.

819
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:39,079
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

820
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,837
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

821
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:45,966
Hey, he pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

822
00:59:47,025 --> 00:59:49,127
(GROWLS)

823
00:59:55,075 --> 00:59:58,850
Wait for the sign. Then all
prisoners will be released.

824
00:59:58,912 --> 01:00:02,607
You will perish in flame, you
and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

825
01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:04,317
What an asshole.

826
01:00:10,632 --> 01:00:13,531
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

827
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,695
Just a moment.

828
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:20,917
- You a Ghostbuster?
- EGON: Yes.

829
01:00:20,976 --> 01:00:23,436
We picked up this guy. Now we
don't know what to do with him.

830
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:26,040
Bellevue doesn't want him, and I'm
afraid to put him in the lock up.

831
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:29,130
I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.

832
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,885
All right.

833
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:36,050
Are you the Gatekeeper?

834
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:41,396
You better bring him inside.

835
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:45,017
You are so kind to
take care of that man.

836
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,060
You know, you are a
real humanitarian.

837
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:49,696
I don't think he's human.

838
01:00:57,554 --> 01:00:59,201
What did you say your name was?

839
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,413
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

840
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:04,749
According to this, his
name's Louis Tully.

841
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:07,334
Lives on Central Park West.

842
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,509
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

843
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,719
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

844
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,218
Yes, have some.

845
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:20,598
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

846
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,513
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

847
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,933
He will come in one of
the pre-chosen forms.

848
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:30,354
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

849
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:34,282
Then, during the third reconciliation of
the last of the Meketrex supplicants,

850
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:37,786
they chose a new form for
him, that of a giant Sloar!

851
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:40,447
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted

852
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:43,283
in the depths of the Sloar
that day, I can tell you.

853
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,795
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

854
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:51,962
There's something very
strange about that man.

855
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,922
Listen, I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling

856
01:01:56,988 --> 01:02:00,183
that something awful is
gonna happen to you.

857
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,679
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

858
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,473
(PHONE RINGS)

859
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:07,266
I'll get it.

860
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:12,229
- Hello?
<i>- PETER: Egon, it's Peter.</i>

861
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,649
- Thanks, I've got it.
- I have news from the world of Gozer.

862
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:18,989
<i>- What is it, Peter?</i>
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.

863
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:21,780
It seems the Goz has
been putting some moves

864
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:24,996
- on my would-be girlfriend.
<i>- How is she?</i>

865
01:02:25,058 --> 01:02:28,662
I think we can get her a
guest shot on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

866
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:31,798
I just whacked her up with
about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

867
01:02:31,857 --> 01:02:36,087
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

868
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:38,676
- Does that make any sense to you?
<i>- Some.</i>

869
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:41,432
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

870
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,344
Oh, wonderful. We have to
get these two together.

871
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:49,269
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

872
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,777
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

873
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,155
Good.

874
01:02:55,213 --> 01:03:00,240
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find
Ray. I need him here immediately.

875
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,206
Bad news, honey,
I gotta go to work.

876
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:11,247
Hey, will you stay here
in bed until I get back?

877
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:21,173
(♪♪)

878
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:24,058
WINSTON:
Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?

879
01:03:24,117 --> 01:03:25,218
RAY: Never met him.

880
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:29,891
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

881
01:03:29,956 --> 01:03:34,027
This roof cap is made of a
magnesium-tungsten alloy.

882
01:03:34,085 --> 01:03:36,529
What are you so
involved with there?

883
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:38,847
These are the blueprints for
the structural ironwork

884
01:03:38,873 --> 01:03:42,815
in Dana Barrett's apartment building,
and they're very, very strange.

885
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:46,703
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about

886
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:50,870
the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

887
01:03:51,186 --> 01:03:54,085
I remember Revelations 7:12.

888
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:56,709
And I looked as he
opened the sixth seal.

889
01:03:56,775 --> 01:03:58,843
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

890
01:03:58,902 --> 01:04:01,425
And the sun became as
black as sackcloth.

891
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:03,343
And the moon became as blood.

892
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,430
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

893
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:11,098
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

894
01:04:11,164 --> 01:04:14,268
Every ancient religion has its own
myth about the end of the world.

895
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:18,109
Myth? Ray, has it
ever occurred to you

896
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:20,441
that maybe the reason
we've been so busy lately

897
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:23,736
is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

898
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:33,329
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

899
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,418
(♪♪)

900
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,789
This way.

901
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:23,549
Excuse me.

902
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:26,831
Excuse me. Just where do
you think you're going?

903
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:30,139
Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested
for interfering with the police...

904
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:32,850
Oh, no. Hold on. I've seen TV.
I know you can't come in here

905
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,580
without a warrant or
a writ or something.

906
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:37,810
Cease and Desist All Commerce order.
Seizure of Premises and Chattels.

907
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:40,775
Ban on the use of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers

908
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,690
and a federal Entry
and Inspection order.

909
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,951
Vinz, there's one more
test I'd like to perform.

910
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:51,365
JANINE: Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

911
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:55,206
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

912
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,129
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines would be extremely hazardous.

913
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,848
I'll tell you what's hazardous.
You're facing federal prosecution

914
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:03,176
for at least a half a dozen
environmental violations.

915
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:05,934
Now, either you shut off these
beams, or we shut them off for you.

916
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,477
Try to understand, this is a
high-voltage laser containment system.

917
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,389
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

918
01:06:16,456 --> 01:06:19,901
Don't patronize me. I'm not grotesquely
stupid, like the people you bilk.

919
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,633
At ease, officer.
I'm Peter Venkman.

920
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:23,545
I think there's just been a
slight misunderstanding,

921
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,740
and I want to cooperate
in any way that I can.

922
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,322
Forget it, Venkman. You had
your chance to cooperate,

923
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:32,240
but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wiseass.

924
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:34,407
He wants to shut down the
protection grid, Peter.

You shut that thing down, and we are
not gonna be held responsible...

926
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:41,165
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
- No, we won't be held responsible.

927
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,335
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

this before. I don't know...

Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

01:06:52,992 --> 01:06:56,187
- My friend, don't be a jerk.
- Step aside.

If he does that again,
you can shoot him.

like the kind of telemetry tracker

that NASA uses to identify

make them like they used to, huh?

No. Nobody ever

You never studied.

967
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,799
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna

968
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,380
that was designed and built
expressly for the purpose

spiritual turbulence.

Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

She's not my girlfriend.
I find her interesting because

972
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,252
she's a client and because
she sleeps above her covers.

973
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:58,398
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

Something terrible is
about to enter our world,

976

and this building is obviously the door.
The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.

977
01:12:07,432 --> 01:12:11,162
I found it in <i>Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>
He was also a doctor.

978
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:13,830
He performed a lot of
unnecessary surgery.

979
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,875
And then, in 1920, he
started a secret society.

980
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:20,841
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

981
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:23,214
No studying.

982
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:28,933
After the first World War, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

983
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:35,605
And he wasn't alone. He had close to
a thousand followers when he died.

984
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:37,733
They conducted rituals
up on the roof,

985
01:12:37,795 --> 01:12:41,445
bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

986
01:12:41,507 --> 01:12:44,611
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

before a federal judge and say

992
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:03,547
that some moldy Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West

993
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:06,808
- and start tearing up the city?
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.

994
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:09,640
- Yeah, big difference.
- No offense,

995

- My name is Peck.

- I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

1061
01:17:53,611 --> 01:17:56,555
I'm gonna get you a nice fruit
basket. I'm going to miss him.

1062
01:17:56,614 --> 01:17:58,136
All right. All right.

1063
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:02,053
We got work to do. Now,
what do you need from me?

1064
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,722
(YELLING)

1065

(♪♪)

1066
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:17,943
Come on, let's run some red lights!

1067
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:22,762
Hello, New York.

1068
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,684
Hello, everybody!

1069
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,195
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

1070
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:38,528
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

1071
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:43,659
- I like that shirt, friend.
- Ghostbusters! All right!

1072
01:19:46,223 --> 01:19:49,452
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

1073
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,371
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

1074
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:08,145
(RUMBLING)

1075
01:20:23,969 --> 01:20:27,073
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

(CHEERING)

1080
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:34,606
I was in no way prepared for that.

1081
01:21:35,374 --> 01:21:38,478
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

1082
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:40,988
We can take it. They
want to play rough.

1083
01:21:41,046 --> 01:21:45,652
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1084
01:21:47,261 --> 01:21:48,954
- Wanna play rough?
- Yeah.

1085
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:50,865
Let's do it.

(GASPING)

1087
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:17,937
Where are we?

1088
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,196
It looks like we're in
the teens somewhere.

1089
01:22:22,296 --> 01:22:26,651
Well, when we get to 20,
tell me. I'm gonna throw up.

01:22:58,123 --> 01:23:02,854
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- PETER: Yep.

1092
01:23:11,637 --> 01:23:14,411
Art deco. Very nice.

1093
01:23:14,473 --> 01:23:17,452
- Where is it?
- It's at the end of the hall.

1094
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:00,536
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1095
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,753
They go up.

01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:12,055

01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:14,152
Okay, so she's a dog.

(GROWLING)

1102
01:25:53,507 --> 01:25:55,325
It's a girl.

1103
01:26:00,597 --> 01:26:03,075
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

1104
01:26:03,141 --> 01:26:07,087
- It's whatever it wants to be.
- Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1105
01:26:07,145 --> 01:26:08,747
Right.

1106
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,416
Go get her, Ray!

1107
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:25,935
Gozer the Gozerian?

1108
01:26:28,166 --> 01:26:33,363
Good evening. As a duly designated
representative of the city,

1109

county and state of New York,

1110
01:26:35,299 --> 01:26:37,902
I order you to cease any and
all supernatural activity

1111
01:26:37,968 --> 01:26:39,945
and return forthwith to
your place of origin

1112
01:26:40,053 --> 01:26:42,952
or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1113
01:26:43,056 --> 01:26:45,784
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1114
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:48,545
(IN DEMONIC VOICE) Are you a god?

1115

- No.
- Then die!

(CROWD SCREAMING)

1118
01:27:24,222 --> 01:27:30,455
Ray, when someone asks you if
you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1119
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:35,843
All right. This chick is toast.

1120
01:27:48,038 --> 01:27:50,641
- Got your stick?
- Holding it.

1121
01:27:52,584 --> 01:27:54,152
Heat them up!

1122
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:56,025
Smoking!

1123
01:27:56,588 --> 01:27:59,532
- Make them hard.
- Ready!

1124
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:02,945
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1125
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,998
Throw it!

1126
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:19,720
- Nimble little minx, isn't she?
- We better go full stream.

1127
01:28:19,778 --> 01:28:22,176
Aim for the flattop.

1128
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,725
Wasn't so hard.

1129
01:28:39,965 --> 01:28:41,567
We neutronized it.

1130
01:28:41,633 --> 01:28:44,361
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1131
01:28:44,428 --> 01:28:47,372
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1132
01:28:47,431 --> 01:28:49,829
It's Miller time.

1133
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:54,667
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
- Oh, no.

1134
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,332
What?

the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor,

Volguus Zildrohar the
Traveler has come.

1139
01:29:41,151 --> 01:29:44,130
Choose and perish.

1140
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:47,807
What do you mean, "choose"?
We don't understand.

1141
01:29:47,866 --> 01:29:53,644
GOZER: Choose. Choose the
form of the Destructor.

1142
01:29:53,747 --> 01:29:58,444
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Oh, very cute.

1143
01:29:58,877 --> 01:30:01,821
Whatever we think of. If we
think of J. Edgar Hoover,

1144
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,280
J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, so empty your heads.

1145
01:30:05,342 --> 01:30:08,321
Don't think of anything. We've
only got one shot at this.

1146
01:30:08,386 --> 01:30:12,332
- GOZER: The choice is made.
- Whoa!

1147

01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,004
Nobody choosed anything.

1149

- Did you choose anything?
- No.

1150
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:20,189
- Did you?
- My mind is totally blank.

1151
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,668
I didn't choose anything!

1152

I couldn't help it.

1153
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,353
It just popped in there.

1154
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:41,611
What? What just popped in there?

1155
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,649
- I tried to think...
- Look!

1156
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:48,156
- No! It can't be.
- What is it?

1157
01:30:48,218 --> 01:30:50,036
- It can't be.
- What did you do, Ray?

1158
01:30:50,095 --> 01:30:52,323
Oh, shit.

1159
01:31:03,108 --> 01:31:05,302
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

1162
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:38,910
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1163
01:31:38,977 --> 01:31:40,920
I tried to think of the
most harmless thing.

1164
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:43,081
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1165
01:31:43,148 --> 01:31:48,095
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1166
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:50,255
Nice thinking, Ray.

1167
01:31:51,156 --> 01:31:53,258
We used to roast Stay
Puft marshmallows

1168
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:55,268
by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1169
01:31:56,953 --> 01:32:01,274
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1170
01:32:01,499 --> 01:32:06,776
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1171
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:19,785
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

Nobody steps on a
church in my town.

One, two, three, roast him.

1174
01:32:49,923 --> 01:32:51,650
Funny, us going out like this.

1175
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:54,160
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1176
01:32:54,219 --> 01:32:57,520
We've been going about this all wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is okay. He's a sailor.

1177
01:32:57,555 --> 01:33:01,501
He's in New York. We get this guy
laid, we won't have any trouble.

1178
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,462
I have a radical idea. The
door swings both ways.

1179
01:33:08,525 --> 01:33:11,128
We could reverse the particle
flow through the gate.

1180
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:13,137
RAY: How?

1181
01:33:13,196 --> 01:33:15,515
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1182
01:33:15,573 --> 01:33:17,471
You said crossing the
streams was bad.

1183
01:33:17,534 --> 01:33:20,763
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1184
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,681
You're gonna endanger our client,

1185
01:33:22,747 --> 01:33:25,851
the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1186
01:33:25,959 --> 01:33:30,155
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1187
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,615
I love this plan. I'm excited to
be a part of it. Let's do it.

1188
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:43,502
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

Hurry.

1190

See you on the other side, Ray.

01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:39,993

Oh, thank God.

01:35:45,849 --> 01:35:47,667
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

- You all right?
- I'm all right.

- Yeah. You okay?

barbecued dog hair.

Oh, Venkman.

1212
01:36:07,203 --> 01:36:09,522
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1213
01:36:10,123 --> 01:36:13,147
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

(♪♪)

1216
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:59,068
Somebody turn on the lights!

1217
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:02,359
- Help! Somebody!
- Go check on that little guy.

1218
01:37:07,764 --> 01:37:09,787
What happened?

1219
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:20,760
Oh. Oh. Where am I?

1220
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:25,716
Oh, hi.

1221
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,933
EGON: You'll be all right.

1222
01:37:28,326 --> 01:37:31,930
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1223
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:35,354
Are you okay?

1224
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,894
Who are you guys?

1225
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:40,109
We're the Ghostbusters.

1226
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,362
Who does your taxes?

1227
01:37:45,009 --> 01:37:48,238
RAY: You know, Mr. Tully, you are
a most fortunate individual.

1228
01:37:48,304 --> 01:37:50,702
- I know.
- You have been a participant in

1229
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:54,460
the biggest interdimensional cross rip
since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1230
01:37:54,519 --> 01:37:56,792
- Felt great.
- We'd like to get a sample

1231
01:37:56,854 --> 01:37:59,833
- of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1232

I love this town!
