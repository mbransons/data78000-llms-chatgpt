1
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,908
I know.

2
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,884
I know.

3
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,982
If this keeps up, we won't be
in London till Boxing Day.

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,664
I know.

5
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,825
get him there for the publicity.

6
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,530
Only told you three times last week.
How do I get through to you, birdbrain?

7
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:16,507
Yeah. Sure, I can stall 'em.
Till about 1 0:00.

8
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,373
And then after that,
we've blown it.

9
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,676
Well, isn't there
a short cut you can take?

10
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,513
I mean, this is supposed to be
the main publicity for the new album.

11
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:29,588
Well, do it!

12
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,054
You're not on your own, pal.

13
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,592
Does he have to do that now?

14
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,521
I know.

15
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,534
I know. I was talking about it
last week, but that isn't the point.

16
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,367
The point is that we are sitting
in the middle of a traffic jam...

17
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,068
the proportions of which
would astound you.

18
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,475
There are three miles
of roadworks and no way out.

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,072
- Unless, of course,
you can suggest something.

20
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:01,142
- Today's top temperature:
46 degrees Fahrenheit.
- And the same to you, sir.

21
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,314
Anyway, this should help you
take your mind off the gloom.

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,857
- Remember the summer of'66.

23
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,864
I know. I know.

24
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,094
-   Good day, sunshine
- I know.

25
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,901
- I know about it. I know.
-  Good day, sunshine

26
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,943
I need to laugh
and when the sun is out

27
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,138
I've got something
I can laugh about

28
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,708
I feel good in a special way

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,812
I'm in love
and it's a sunny day

30
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,983
Good day, sunshine

31
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:45,086
Good day, sunshine

32
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,598
Good day, sunshine

33
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:53,195
We take a walk
The sun is shining down

34
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,402
Burns my feet
as I touch the ground

35
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,150
Good day, sunshine

36
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,951
Good day, sunshine

37
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,613
Good day, sunshine

38
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,589
Good day, sunshine

39
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,151
Good day, sunshine

40
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,793
Good day, sunshine

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,430
- Yes, Steve.
- We're up a gum tree, Macca.

42
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,709
- Why? What's up?
- The whole bloody game's up.
The tapes have vanished.

43
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,839
Oh, that. Not to worry.
Harry's got them.

44
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,713
He took them home
from the studio last night...

45
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,686
and he's personally delivering them
round to the factory this morning.

46
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,222
Well, that's just it.
He hasn't shown up yet.

47
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,816
I rang his ever-loving missus,
but she's worried because
he didn't come home last night.

48
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,862
- Did you try Sandra?
- She hasn't seen him either.

49
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,593
Okay. Don't tell anyone.
I'll be right with you.

50
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,233
Don't tell anyone?

51
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,007
- Ah, Mr. Stanley.
- Good to see you.

52
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,916
- Inspector, thanks for coming.

53
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,223
- It's a lovely day for a drive.
- Marvelous.

54
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,494
It's too late
to stop it now, I'm afraid.

55
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,996
The television campaign
starts this week...

56
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,160
supported by merchandising, point
of sale, T-shirts, badges and a poster.

57
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,669
Well, I can't ring
Geoffrey on this one.

58
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,639
There's no way I can tell him
that it's gone missing.

59
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,976
- They already knew.
- Hopefully, it will be forthcoming.

60
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,451
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning.

61
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:33,355
Yes, that's true.
But the position is very serious indeed.

62
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,192
Any extra liabilities such as this
will place a great strain
on your capital reserves...

63
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:43,792
and increase the possibility
of the company being taken over
by Rathbone Industries.

64
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,136
That's Rath. Rathbone Industries.

65
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,042
They all seem
to be here now.

66
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,084
It would appear that
a Mr. Harold Torrington
is an employee of these companies.

67
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,283
- Correct.
- You are aware, of course...

68
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,659
that he has a criminal record, which
includes burglary and petty larceny.

69
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,562
- Yep, we know.
- I understand the tapes...

70
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,727
entrusted to Mr. Torrington's care
are extremely valuable.

71
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,796
Based on last year's figures,
at today's prices, I'd say about
five or six million pounds.

72
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,141
They're the equivalent of--
They're the be all and end all.

73
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,149
- If they're lost, all is lost.
- And yet it would appear...

74
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:36,813
you were quite happy
to place such a valuable asset
in the hands of this man.

75
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,857
Yeah. We knew about him
when he joined...

76
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,257
but he swore he'd been straight
for a couple of years.

77
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,556
I'm telling you,
I believe him.

78
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:49,431
He is straight. This whole thing's
a mistake. Where was he last seen?

79
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,470
Tom and Beryl saw him leaving
the Old Justice about half 1 0:00.

80
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:57,271
- He had the tapes with him.
- And no one's seen
hide nor hair of him since.

81
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,971
- Nobody.
- I must remind you that in this case...

82
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,982
there are certain other agreements
to be taken into consideration.

83
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:10,249
Such as the arrangement entered
into with Mr. William Rath
of Rathbone Industries.

84
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,916
In fact, Mr. Rath has asked me
to point out to you...

85
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,996
that unless the tapes are found
by midnight tonight...

86
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,590
the consequences will be...
very serious.

87
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,446
I guess we have to console
ourselves with the fact...

88
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,914
that everything that can
be done is being done.

89
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,747
I mean, the inspector
is well on the case.

90
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,448
He's got an up-to-date description
of Harry... and the tape box.

91
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,924
And everything...
is being done.

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,697
Thank you.
The car is ready, sir.

93
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,862
Ah. Thanks.

94
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,907
Yeah. Well, thanks anyway.

95
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,577
He told me he was straight,
and I believed him.

96
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,083
I suggested at the time it wasn't
exactly the smartest move on earth.

97
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,381
- What's he gonna do with the tapes?
- Bootleg them.

98
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,925
There are plenty of people who'd pay big
quid to get their hands on those tracks.

99
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,688
Big Bob, for instance.
To name but a few.

100
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,389
What's all this about a takeover
by Rathbone Industries?

101
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,756
- I didn't know about that.
- Slight danger.

102
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,352
Nothing you need worry about.

103
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,023
Get hold of Big Bob, will you?

104
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,432
- He's about, isn't he?
- Yeah. I saw him last week.

105
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:36,095
You see, there's gonna be
all kinds of complications we
haven't even thought about yet.

106
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,170
Yeah?

107
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,832
What?

108
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,843
I haven't thought
about 'em yet.

109
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,414
- Hiya. All right.
- Hey.

110
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,177
- Listen, have you heard the news?
- What news?

111
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,912
- You know, about the tapes.
- What about the tapes?

112
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,956
Well, Harry, he's supposed to be
taking them down the factory.

113
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,991
- He's gone missing.
- Missing?

114
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,253
- And the tapes too.
- Harry and the tapes are missing?

115
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,421
They've been phoning him all night.
Nobody seems to be able to raise him.

116
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,500
- Who's looking for him?
- Don't know. Great news, isn't it?

117
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:13,004
- Oh, God.

118
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,596
Well, what are we gonna do?

119
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,973
- You know, I don't fancy
recording them again.
- No, no need to do that.

120
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,241
You don't think Harry would go and do
a stupid thing like that, do you?

121
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,748
Yes, I do.

122
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,378
- Ready to do one?

123
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,892
Hello,Joey.
Have you seen Big Bob?

124
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,867
It's Alan.
Yeah, have you seen him?

125
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,096
No, no, I don't mean that.
I mean have you seen him today?

126
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,573
- So, what are we doing?
- The medley.

127
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,708
- What medley?
- Okay, Paul, I'd like
to hear a run-through.

128
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,912
Okay. Ready?

129
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,982
Brushes.

130
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,904
Coming ready or not, boys.

131
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,318
Yesterday

132
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:44,529
All my troubles seemed
so far away

133
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:49,430
Now it looks as though
they're here to stay

134
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,766
Oh, I believe

135
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,932
In yesterday

136
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,204
Suddenly

137
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,577
I'm not half the man
I used to be

138
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,242
Very bloody appropriate.

139
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,755
There's a shadow
hanging over me

140
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,825
Oh, yesterday

141
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,190
Came suddenly

142
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:22,700
Why she had to go

143
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,497
I don't know
She wouldn't say

144
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,171
I don't know
She wouldn't say

145
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,612
I said something wrong

146
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:41,243
Now I long for yesterday

147
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,289
Yesterday

148
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:50,828
Love was such
an easy game to play

149
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,833
Now I need a place
to hide away

150
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,166
Oh, I believe

151
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,729
In yesterday

152
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,710
To lead a better life

153
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,814
I need a love of my own

154
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,956
Here

155
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,536
Making each day of the year

156
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:38,643
Changing my life
with a wave ofher hand

157
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,612
Nobody can deny

158
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,152
That there's something there

159
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,984
I want her everywhere

160
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,188
And if she's beside me
I know I need never care

161
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,359
But to love her
is to need her everywhere

162
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:09,499
Knowing that love
is to share

163
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:15,444
Each one believing
that love never dies

164
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,710
Watching her eyes

165
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,845
And hoping
I'm always there

166
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,949
I will be here, there

167
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,823
And everywhere

168
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,331
Here, there

169
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,335
And everywhere

170
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:24,510
Light out wanderlust

171
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:30,350
Head us out to sea

172
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:36,326
Captain says
there'll be a bust

173
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:41,991
This one's not for me

174
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:48,006
Take us from the dark

175
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:53,602
Out where we can see

176
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:59,275
Captain's out
to make his mark

177
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,220
This one's not to be

178
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:10,728
Light out wanderlust

179
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:16,324
Help us to be free

180
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:21,771
Light out wanderlust

181
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,901
Do it just for me

182
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,503
Wanderlust

183
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,993
Captain's out
to make his mark

184
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:52,128
This one's not to be

185
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,229
Oh, where did I

186
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,138
Go wrong, my love

187
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,613
What petty crime
was I found guilty of

188
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,149
What better time

189
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:11,279
To find a brand-new day

190
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,917
Oh, wanderlust away

191
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,020
Light out wanderlust

192
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:24,192
Help us to be free

193
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:31,666
Light out wanderlust

194
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,009
Do itjust for me

195
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,209
Wanderlust

196
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:56,096
Captain says
there'll be a bust

197
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:02,071
This one's not for me

198
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,507
-  Oh, where did I

199
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,409
Go wrong, my love

200
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:13,577
What petty crime
was I found guilty of

201
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,552
-   Captain says
-  What better time

202
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,920
-   There'll be a bust
-  To find a brand-new day

203
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:25,428
-   This one's not for me
-  Oh, wanderlust away

204
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,295
Dropping a line

205
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,891
Maybe it's time

206
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,133
It's wanderlust

207
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,142
For me

208
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,118
Do you want to hear it?

209
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,356
Yeah.

210
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,234
It's gonna be
one of those days.

211
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,557
Cheers, Harry.

212
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,489
They tell me
you just got out.

213
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm not a bloody criminal.

214
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,264
Look. No mask. I ain't got
any dynamite. Left it all at home.

215
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,843
No. Really, I was set up.

216
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,848
By this nutty copper.
You know, framed.

217
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,441
It's always been
like that with me.

218
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,215
Even at school
they had it in for me.

219
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:02,658
Boy Scouts.
I got sent home from camp.

220
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,527
Caught smoking.
I wasn't the only one.

221
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,363
They said I was a bad influence
on the others.

222
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,994
Same in prison.

223
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,405
This cop frames me. I said,
"But I didn't do it, Your Honor.''

224
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,275
Didn't believe me.
I'm not a bad boy.

225
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,317
Not really.
I'm just... manipulated.

226
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,685
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a chance.

227
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,385
If you're fibbing and you do one
thing wrong, you'll be out. I mean it.

228
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,088
- But if you're straight
with me, you'll be in.
- Yeah, I want to be in.

229
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,825
Okay, that's it.
You're in. It's a pact.

230
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,391
- Packet of what?
- Pact. A deal.

231
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,166
- A pact.
- A pact.

232
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:52,175
Apact. Apact. Apact.

233
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,847
'Ere, mate. Stick your
moniker on there, will ya?

234
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,927
My wife likes your music.
I don't.

235
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,225
But I'll get lynched
if I goes home without it.

236
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,766
- That mightn't be such a bad idea.
- You're right.

237
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,178
What room are we in?

238
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,807
Ah, um, it's... 51 6.

239
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,010
Ta.

240
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,716
Oh, uh, okay.
I'll be in the corridor if you need me.

241
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,802
- What was that for?
- I don't need him around all the time.

242
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,569
- Yeah, but he's very loyal.
- So is my pet cocker spaniel.

243
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,237
- Don't let it get to you.
- Don't let it get to me?

244
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,906
Oh, no,
I won't let it get to me.

245
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,644
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a beautiful summer's day.
There's not a cloud in the sky.

246
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,187
And there's probably
a bluebird on my shoulder.

247
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,916
Yeah, well, that's
really gonna help, isn't it?

248
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,017
You lose your grip, I'll work
myself up into a frenzy, and we
can all go and throw tantrums.

249
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,995
Well, it's not my fault.
I didn't hire him.

250
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,726
Oh. I love it.

251
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,496
Come on.
Let's spit it out, shall we?

252
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,072
It's all my fault.
Bad judgment.

253
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,971
Once a villain,
always a villain, right?

254
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,204
My judgment wasn't so bad when I
brought you into the company, was it?

255
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,576
Then you sing the songs,
and I'll run the business.

256
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,481
Talking about running the business,
what I'd like to know is...

257
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,316
how did we get so heavily involved
with this Rath character?

258
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,792
Yeah, well, he's part of that group
that arranged the bank loan last year.

259
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,295
You remember? We had
a short-term cash flow problem.

260
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,891
I showed you the papers. 'Course,
I never expected to end up like this.

261
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,630
Mr. McCartney,
ready for your makeup.

262
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,804
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-ay

263
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,077
My, my, my
What a wonderful day

264
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,312
Oh, plenty of sunshine going my way

265
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,912
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-ay

266
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:22,584
There's a bluebird
on my shoulder

267
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,218
It's the truth
It's actual--

268
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,896
Okay, now you remember the bit
where you're in the china cup?

269
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,701
Good. That's good.

270
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,868
- Slow. Clap. Hold.

271
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,947
Step, step, hold.
And up and hold.

272
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,915
And hold and drop.
Not bad. Let's do it again.

273
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,976
Come on. Once again. Okay.

274
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,928
Hi. I don't believe
we've been introduced.

275
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,023
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to write an article.

276
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,467
- Oh, yeah?
- It's on the relative value
of popular music...

277
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:10,098
as a therapeutic tool
for social services.

278
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,574
I'm on drums.

279
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,237
Members of the band on stage, please.

280
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,872
Can I get some
of your time later, to talk?

281
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:22,920
You can have hours, if you don't mind
waiting a minute. See you later.

282
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,649
"Ballroom Dancing, '"dress rehearsal.

283
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,553
Stand by.
And... action.!

284
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,194
One, two.
One, two, three, four!

285
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,302
Well, I used to smile
when I was a pup

286
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,169
Sailing down the Nile
in a china cup

287
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,369
With a recipe
for a lovely day

288
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,106
Sticking out my back pocket

289
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,278
That's it, kids.

290
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,011
But it wasn't always
such a pretty sight

291
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,986
We used to fight
like cats and dogs

292
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:01,684
Till we made it up
in the ballroom

293
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,386
Ballroom dancing

294
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,657
Made a man of me

295
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,758
One, two, three, four

296
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,838
I just plain adore your

297
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,272
Ballroom dancing

298
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,570
Seen it on TV

299
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,805
I got what I got

300
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,575
From ballroom dancing

301
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,983
Big B.D.

302
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,612
Here we go.!

303
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,954
Well, I used to fly
when I was a kid

304
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,994
And I didn't cry
if it hurt a bit

305
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,656
On a carpet ride
to a foreign land

306
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,734
At the time of Davy Crockett

307
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,826
Wave the sword!

308
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,667
But it wasn't always
such a pretty sight

309
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,640
We used to fight
like cats and dogs

310
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,474
Till me made it up
in the ballroom

311
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,243
Ballroom dancing

312
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,842
Made a man of me

313
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,252
One, two, three, four

314
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,985
I just plain adore

315
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,254
Your ballroom dancing

316
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,229
Seen it on TV

317
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:18,792
I got quite a lot
from ballroom dancing

318
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:22,464
Big B.D.

319
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,748
Come on!

320
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,758
Now look here!

321
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,809
Well, it went so fast
and we all grew up

322
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,405
Now the days that passed
in the china cup

323
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,212
Are the memories
of another day

324
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,483
And I wouldn't
want to knock it

325
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,889
But it wasn't always
such a pretty sight

326
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,928
'Cause we used to fight
like cats and dogs

327
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,931
Till we made it up
in the ballroom

328
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,870
Ballroom dancing

329
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,804
Made a man of me

330
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,808
One and two
and three and four

331
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:11,906
I just plain adore
your ballroom dancing

332
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,780
Seen it on TV

333
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,979
I got what I got

334
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:25,018
From ballroom dancing
Big B.D.

335
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,239
I say!

336
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,118
What's going on?

337
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,395
Well, the kids have flown
to a better life

338
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,738
Now the boy's a man
and the girl's a wife

339
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,574
And the summertime
never seems to last

340
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,582
When you're riding
on the rocket

341
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,017
But, but it wasn't always
such a pretty sight

342
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,146
We used to fight
like cats and dogs

343
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,124
Till we made it up
in the ballroom

344
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:06,561
- Be off!
-  Ballroom dancing

345
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:10,065
Made a man of me

346
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,569
One and a two
and a three and a four

347
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:18,335
I just plain adore
your ballroom dancing

348
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:22,311
Seen it on TV

349
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,645
I got quite a lot
from ballroom dancng

350
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,551
Big B.D.

351
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,026
Lunch?

352
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,338
Okay, lunch, everybody.
One hour. Back at 2:00.

353
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,910
Oh, thank you.

354
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,776
Have we finished?

355
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,415
This album's really fine.

356
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,970
- How's your food?
- I'm not really hungry.

357
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,741
No, me neither.

358
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,715
- Mind if I ask you some questions then?
- No.

359
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:37,049
- Tape doesn't bother you, does it?
- No, not at all.

360
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,146
So, has the album
been completed?

361
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,384
Yeah, we've finished
the album.

362
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,518
- Is there a release date?
- Oh, not yet. We've gotta
get the cover together.

363
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,596
- Have you heard any of it?
- No.

364
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,426
- Would you like to?
- I'd love to.

365
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,797
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

366
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,928
Why don't you come over to my place,
and I'll play you some tracks.

367
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,438
We can talk more, 'cause you'll know
what we're talking about.

368
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,806
- That would be terrific.
- It's only a rough cassette...

369
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,903
but it'll give you some idea.

370
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,024
- Hi, Sandra. How are you?
- Fine, thanks. Can't complain.

371
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,686
- Have you seen Harry lately?
- Yeah.

372
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:22,596
Did anyone tell you
what all this is about?

373
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,533
Well, yeah.

374
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,696
But it's not true.
I know it!

375
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:33,573
He was around the other evening feeling
great, going on about the new album.

376
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,772
Oh, no, nothing like that.

377
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,543
He was too up on it all.

378
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,780
I wouldn't have been able to tell you
if he was thinking anything like that.

379
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,914
I'm his shoulder
to cry on, you see.

380
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,221
I can always sense
how things are.

381
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,525
Well, I don't believe it myself,
but the pressure is most definitely on.

382
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,971
Don't worry.

383
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,567
Come on, San.
Let's get out of here.

384
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,669
See you later.

385
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:17,151
Why don't you come along?

386
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,324
Well, g'day, fellows.
Got some news?

387
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,330
We were rather hoping that you might
have some news for us, Mr. Stanley.

388
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,955
Um--

389
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,762
Ladies and gentlemen of thejury--

390
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,030
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury--

391
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,129
Yes, sir.

392
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,767
Well, basically, we have been
keeping an eye on all of them.

393
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,710
- Oh,ju-just a minute, sir.

394
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,318
Hello? Hello, sir?

395
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,389
Well, yes, I do appreciate
that from where you sit...

396
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,654
it may seem a little... far-fetched.

397
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,457
Uh, no, sir. No, I--

398
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,830
I do not need a holiday,
thank you very much.

399
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:08,304
Oh, I shall be very glad to get
to the bottom of this myself.

400
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,533
Yes, sir. Right, sir.

401
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,132
- Good-bye, sir.

402
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,506
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

403
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,743
- You sure?
- Yeah.

404
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,049
Just look after her.

405
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,807
You'd think that people would have
had enough of silly love songs

406
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:58,244
But I look around me
and I see it isn't so

407
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,045
Oh, no

408
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:06,089
Some people want to fill the world
with silly love songs

409
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,721
What's wrong with that

410
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,628
I'd like to know

411
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,760
'Cause here I go

412
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,896
Again

413
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:28,502
I love you

414
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:36,219
I love you

415
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:43,588
I love you

416
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:50,565
I love you

417
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:57,972
I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me

418
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,236
Say, can't you see

419
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,835
Ah, she gave it all

420
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,145
She gave it all to me
Say, can't you see

421
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,786
What's wrong with that

422
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,948
I need to know

423
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,893
'Cause here I go

424
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:22,090
Again

425
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,535
I love you

426
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,876
I love you

427
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,573
Love doesn't come
in a minute

428
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,814
Sometimes it doesn't
come at all

429
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,221
I only know
that when I'm in it

430
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,989
It isn't silly
No, it isn't silly

431
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:57,625
Love isn't silly at all

432
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:32,364
I love you

433
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:39,803
I love you

434
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:46,972
-  I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me
-  I love you

435
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,348
Say, can't you see

436
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:54,049
-  I love you
-  Ah, he gave it all
He gave it all to me

437
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,718
Say, can't you see

438
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:01,890
-  I love you
-  I can't explain
The feeling's plain to me

439
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,126
Say, can't you see

440
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:09,070
-  I love you
-  Ah, he gave it all
He gave it all to me

441
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,266
Say, can't you see

442
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,215
Whoo!

443
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,770
You'd think that people would have
had enough of silly love songs

444
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:53,042
But I look around me
and I see it isn't so

445
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,914
Oh, no

446
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,650
Some people want to fill the world
with silly love songs

447
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,993
And what's wrong with that

448
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,146
Okay, and house lights.

449
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,789
And cut the steam.!

450
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,259
- Nice one, mate.
- Thank you.

451
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,820
I'll see you in a minute.

452
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,559
I'm just gonna get
all this off. Okay?

453
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,811
G'day, fellows. Don't look so worried.
Everything'll work out great.

454
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:07,050
appreciate the urgency of the situation.

455
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,365
Time is of the essence,
Mr. Stanley.

456
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,493
- Don't hassle me!
- You have until midnight!

457
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,595
Don't you fellows
have anything better to do?

458
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,593
He was down
at the Old Justice last night.

459
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:59,074
Yeah. I was down there
with Beryl when he came in.

460
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,373
Seemed quite happy.
Had a couple of drinks.

461
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:05,505
Didn't look like he was
thinking of doing a bunk.

462
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,447
He wouldn't!
I know he wouldn't!

463
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,487
I assumed he was going
back home to his missus.

464
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:16,322
He only did it because of her.

465
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,861
But we don't think
he did it, do we?

466
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,176
There he is.!

467
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:46,017
Down here, lads!
Come on!

468
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,999
Come on!
After him!

469
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:50,482
Dear, dear.!
Look at that. God.!

470
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:56,785
You better take Sandra
back to her place, I think.

471
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,863
Don't worry, love.
We'll sort it out.

472
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,363
- Thanks.
- Okay.

473
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,903
Someone we know?

474
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,370
Just coming round the corner.
He said he didn't see the van.

475
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,998
Terrific . That's all we need.

476
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,373
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-ay

477
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,345
My, my, my
What a wonderful day

478
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,721
Hello. All right?

479
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,231
Hi.

480
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,769
Ring Val.
Get the telexes.

481
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,861
Can I have a line?

482
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,823
Take a pic.

483
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,863
I'd love a copy.

484
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,201
- Send me your address.
- Okay.

485
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,774
- You could leave it for me too.
- Sure.

486
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,141
- How long are you over here for?
- As long as you guys--

487
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,511
- Any news?
- No. They're working on it, though.

488
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,780
I think this is
a pretty cool caper.

489
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,014
I wouldn't trust
any of them really.

490
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,489
Do you think you can get
some heat in here, or are we
practicing to be Canadians?

491
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:39,028
Yeah. Shall we try
"Not Such A Bad Boy''?

492
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,121
- Do we have to?
- Yeah.

493
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,291
This time.

494
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,063
All right.
One, two, three, four!

495
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,781
I laughed at the teachers

496
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,286
Who taught in my school

497
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,358
They kept one-armed bandits

498
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,485
In the swimming pool

499
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:16,123
They don't understand me

500
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,669
But they never will

501
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:24,730
And if I was there
I'd be telling them still

502
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:30,345
I'm not such a bad boy

503
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,314
No more, no more, no more

504
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:37,649
I'm not such a bad boy

505
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,746
No more, no more, no more

506
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,225
I followed the leader

507
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:48,230
Into her tent

508
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,823
But nobody told me

509
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,768
That she owed some rent

510
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,364
She wanted to love me

511
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,774
I wanted to go

512
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:06,315
Well, she taught me things
that I needed to know

513
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,350
You know,you know

514
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:12,478
I'm not such a bad boy

515
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,353
No more, no more, no more

516
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,520
I'm not such a bad boy

517
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,497
No more, no more, no more
Come on, boys.!

518
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,905
Oh,yeah
She wanted to love me

519
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,281
I wanted to go

520
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:48,484
But she taught me things
that I needed to know

521
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,152
She knows, she knows

522
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,753
I'm not such a bad boy

523
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,299
No more, no more, no more

524
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,861
I'm not such a bad boy

525
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,600
No more, no more, no more

526
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,041
I talked to my lawyer

527
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,376
He picked up my bail

528
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,383
Won't someone get me

529
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,817
Out this lousyjail

530
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,455
We're both in agreement

531
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,256
That crime never pays

532
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:32,893
And I should be out
in a couple of days

533
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:37,133
I'm not such a bad boy

534
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,970
No more, no more, no more

535
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:44,104
I'm not such a bad boy

536
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,909
No more, no more, no more

537
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,181
I'm not such
a bad boy no more

538
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:57,955
-  No more, no more
-  I'm not such a bad boy

539
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:02,225
No more, no more, no more

540
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,596
No more, no more,
no more.

541
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,430
Ow.!

542
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,805
- That was great.
- That's great, that.

543
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,967
Yeah, I know.
It's about time you noticed.

544
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,623
Mph. Well, thanks a lot, Tom.

545
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,818
- All right, love.
- Ta-ra.

546
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,391
Don't worry.
He'll turn up.

547
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:51,174
We're just gonna run through a couple of
numbers. We'll try " So Bad.'' All right?

548
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,407
Try that one.

549
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,075
- How's the new house, Eric?
- Shall we try " So Bad''?

550
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,585
It's all right.

551
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,923
Okay. One... and two.

552
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,654
A one, two, three, four.

553
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,433
There is a pain

554
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,012
Inside my heart

555
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:26,913
You mean so much to me

556
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,685
Girl, I love you

557
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,348
Girl, I love you so bad

558
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:44,524
And if you leave
the pain will go

559
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:48,035
But that's no good to me

560
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,130
Girl, I love you

561
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,803
Yes, I love you so bad

562
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:02,212
Well, it feels so good

563
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,188
Sometimes it feels so bad

564
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:13,355
This is worse than anything

565
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:20,027
I've ever had

566
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,035
There was a pain

567
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:30,512
But now you're near
and I don't feel a thing

568
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,373
Girl, I love you

569
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,976
Girl, I love you so bad

570
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,457
And she said

571
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,687
Boy, I love you

572
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,457
Boy, I love you so bad

573
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,658
Ooh

574
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,202
-   I love
-  Girl, I love you

575
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:04,111
-   I love
-  Girl, I love you so bad

576
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,705
I love, I love

577
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,184
Well, it feels so good

578
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:16,316
Sometimes it feels so bad

579
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:22,529
This is worse than anything

580
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,501
I've ever had

581
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,074
There was a pain

582
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,043
But now you're here

583
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,979
And I don't fear a thing

584
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,551
-  I love
-  Girl, I love you

585
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:46,588
-  I love
-  Girl, I love you so bad

586
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,250
I love
I love

587
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,418
And she said

588
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:53,928
Boy, I love you

589
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,626
Boy, I love you so bad

590
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,727
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

591
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,466
Girl, I love you

592
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:09,068
Girl, I love you

593
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:14,081
Ooh

594
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,817
- That wasn't bad for a first take.

595
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:25,452
- All right for me, loves.
I thought that was fine.
- Yeah, it's all right for you.

596
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,767
- Yep. Right.
- Telexes.

597
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,836
Oh, thanks. Mail.

598
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:38,772
Okay. One, two.
One, two, three, four.

599
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,677
Oh, I hear them telling me
that you're selling off the furniture

600
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,018
Even my personalized autographs

601
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:58,220
You might as well go all the way
and sell your granny to the zoo

602
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:05,493
And while you're at it
may I go to my psychiatrist

603
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,935
He's makin' money
out of makin' me laugh

604
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:14,170
But I don't mind
I wish that I could say
the same about you

605
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,869
Oh

606
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,708
Well, it seems to me
that you still got

607
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:22,375
-  No values
-  Oh, you know you're not so hot

608
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,046
- No values
- Yeah, you know you've got a lot but

609
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:31,822
-  No values
-  And I'll be glad
if you went away again

610
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,659
No values, hey
No values

611
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,895
No values at all

612
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,839
Oh, the city shark
is at the dark end of the alleyway

613
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,436
You pays your money
and you takes your choice

614
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,518
The Artful Dodger says
he wants to pick a pocket or two

615
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,557
Oh, but you you've taken up
a place in high society

616
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,061
Apersonal friend
of Messieurs Rolls and Royce

617
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:11,224
Got them all convinced that
everything you say to them is true

618
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,229
Oh

619
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,771
Well, it seems to me
that you've still got

620
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,434
-  No values
-  Oh, you know you're not so hot

621
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,067
No values

622
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,180
Well, you've got a lot but

623
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,747
No values

624
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:29,341
And I'll be glad
if you went away again

625
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:33,582
No values
No values

626
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,786
No values at all

627
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:55,534
Oh oh oh oh ohhh

628
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,876
Oh oh oh ohh

629
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,218
I like your wife's smile

630
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,656
I like her car

631
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,129
If I had your lifestyle

632
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,962
I wouldn't go far wrong

633
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,469
On the waters of life
you row your boat

634
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:28,101
Into the strongest tide
that you can find

635
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:31,806
-  On the darkest of nights
-  On the darkest of nights

636
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,611
-  We were two of a kind
-  We were two of a kind

637
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:41,315
What do we know
before the tide went out

638
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,484
And left us stranded all ashore

639
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,721
How was I to know

640
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,027
How was I to know

641
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,237
-  Well, you ain't got
-  No values

642
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,865
-  Hey, you know you think you're hot
-  No values

643
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,741
-  Oh, you know you've got a lot but
-  No values

644
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,940
And I'll be glad
if you went away again

645
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:10,018
No values, hey
No values

646
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:15,216
Hey, no values at all

647
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,085
Finish it this time!

648
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,915
Don't do it.! Don't do it.!

649
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,889
- Uh, sorry.

650
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,019
Uh, my fault. Let's have a break,
cup of tea or something.

651
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,120
Little break. Yeah?

652
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,291
I'm just gonna see Bob.

653
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,426
All right.

654
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,139
- Both of us?

655
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,675
- Yeah, you come too.
- Oh, great.

656
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,836
What's happening then, Big Bob?

657
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,948
Well, your man gave me a call.

658
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,016
So I slips into
something comfortable...

659
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,118
hops into me new pickup,
and here I am.

660
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,380
- Do you like it? Me new pickup truck.
- What?

661
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,889
Oh, yeah. It's nice.

662
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,751
What's it all about, then,
me old fruit?

663
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,024
You haven't seen Harry then?

664
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,465
Harry who?
HarryJames and the Golden Trumpet?

665
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,400
Or Hare Krishna?

666
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,836
No, Torrington.
Works for us.

667
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,272
Oh, him.

668
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,540
Can't say as I have. Not lately, anyhow.
Has he gone absent without leave?

669
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,080
No, it's just his missus
is worried about him.

670
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,207
Not been up to
his old tricks, has he?

671
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,149
He had quite a promising career
as a young lad, you know.

672
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,245
Could have done
very well with me.

673
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:04,054
He gave that up when he joined us.
Told me he had enough of the bent life.

674
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,063
Not easy. Tried it once.
Lots of willpower needed.

675
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:13,329
I gave up smoking
for two weeks.

676
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,997
- Yeah.

677
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,336
Anyway, listen, Bob.
I've got to shoot over to the BBC.

678
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,775
So, uh, thanks for comin'.
It was nice seein' you. See ya.

679
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:26,370
Here. How's your record
comin' on then?

680
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,418
- It's all right.
- Give you a fancy deal on the side?

681
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,216
Able to offer you very attractive
terms at the moment.

682
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,552
No tell, Bob.
It's all legal nowadays.

683
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,126
Well, what's it
all about then?

684
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:42,391
We're just wondering
about Harry, and someone said
he'd been to see you, and, uh--

685
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,126
- Look, I'll keep an eye out for him.
- Which one?

686
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,169
Me left one.

687
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,347
Guess what. The advance sales on the
new album have topped five million.

688
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,644
And that's
without the record.

689
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,719
How we doin' for time?

690
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:08,153
Ernest, tell the band that will be all
for today. Repeat: all for today.

691
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,090
Yes, sir. That will be all for today.
Repeat: all for today.

692
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,395
Hello, Ernest.
Are you there?

693
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,501
Here they come.

694
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,213
Why don't you go back to the office.
I'll be over later.

695
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,343
Don't worry.
We'll find him tonight.

696
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,879
Come here!

697
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,711
- Have you done this
to my pickup? Have you?

698
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,219
That's him.

699
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,694
That's the box he stole.

700
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,733
His fingerprints are
coming up on the screen now.

701
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,433
We sent a copy of those
to the United States.

702
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,377
the possibility, sir,
that this fellow Torrington...

703
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,879
is perhaps not working
on his own?

704
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,644
Well, he's not the only one
with a vested interest.

705
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,015
Well, I mean,
we've got, uh, Rath...

706
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,851
Steve Stanley, uh, didn't like
the look of that drummer.

707
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,689
Well, they could all have a motive.
Insurance, perhaps.

708
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,025
Yes. Insurance.

709
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:36,033
Are you receiving me, Ernest?
Say something if you can
hear me, Ernest?

710
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:40,199
The band is finished.
We have now left the warehouse.

711
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:44,109
Cops have seen everyone
connected with Harry,
and no one knows a bloody thing.

712
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,546
he's headed for the States.

713
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,618
There's some big
bootleg operations over there.

714
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,619
Big Bob didn't even know
what I was talking about.

715
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,451
The banks are worried.
They need assurances.

716
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,151
Still, could be worse,
I suppose.

717
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,898
Give my regards
to Broad Street, baby

718
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,400
'Cause you know that I'll be there
Oi!

719
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,959
- Can I have your autograph?
- Sure.

720
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,188
- Sign mine.
- Okay, but we're in a bit
of a hurry, all right?

721
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,566
Ta-ra. See you.

722
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,737
Afternoon.

723
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,533
this whole thing up,you know.

724
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,835
I mean, a man is missing.

725
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,743
He once, a long time ago,
had a bit of form.

726
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:54,338
And now here we are.
We've judged him, found him guilty...

727
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,975
sentenced him...
all in one day.

728
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,077
- Isn't that Paul McCartney?
- Anyway...

729
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,918
doesn't fit in with what
he's been telling me recently.

730
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:06,358
- Like what?
- Ah, he feels more secure now.

731
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,397
No scuffers
breathing down his neck.

732
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,558
Not so many nightmares.

733
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,932
Even talking about having kids.

734
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,268
I mean, does that sound to you like
a man who's planning to rob someone?

735
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,604
These things happen
on the spur of the moment.

736
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,008
Hello!

737
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,979
I'm Terry. We met a long time ago
at the Playhouse.

738
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,141
- I don't suppose you remember.
- I think so.

739
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,650
Oh, yes, yes. How nice.
Will you follow me?

740
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,272
- What are we doing?
- Interview and two songs.

741
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,807
Yes. We'll do the interview first,
if you don't mind.

742
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,536
Uh, in here.

743
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,635
One, two, three.
Okay,Jeff?

744
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,715
- Do you know William?
- Yes, of course.

745
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,783
Oh, great.
Wonderful of you to come on.

746
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,977
Grab a seat.

747
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,611
Get me Conway
at Billboard, will you?

748
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,020
Anyway, it's great that you're here.

749
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,821
- Any trouble parking the car?

750
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,293
It's two or three minutes before.

751
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,921
I've just got these
half dozen questions. So, um--

752
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,591
- I'm in your hands. No problem.
- Awkward as we go.

753
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:21,930
- Um, is that okay for you, Terry?
- Lovely.

754
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,006
Go on green.

755
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,199
Okay for level?

756
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,766
Aha. So, right then.

757
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,410
Well, Paul, it's great to have you
with us, and, of course...

758
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,350
all the listeners want to know,
how's the new record coming along?

759
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,354
Well, we finished mixing it last week,
and it sounds good.

760
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,483
Uh-huh. Eh, so we can look forward
to an imminent release?

761
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,585
-Well, um, it shouldn't be too long now.
-Oh, great.

762
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,324
Well, you can rest assured
that all of us here in radioland...

763
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,491
are eagerly awaiting
the arrival of your new songs.

764
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,798
- How many have you got
for us this time? Twelve?
- There's about 1 2 in all.

765
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,466
- Great. Uh, all your own lyrics?
- Yeah, I write my own stuff.

766
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,873
- Great. Fantastic.

767
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,036
Yeah, everything's going great.

768
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:07,172
that do occur occasionally.

769
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,843
The new album?
Yeah, it's very exciting for all of us.

770
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:12,147
- It should be out in the shops soon.
- Yours?

771
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:16,054
- Bless you for coming on.
- You'll be getting your copy
sometime in the next few weeks.

772
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:20,322
And of course I know that goes without
saying for all you lovely listeners too.

773
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,557
Right then.
Let's hear a little music, shall we?

774
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:28,264
Cut.

775
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,373
What a load of cobblers.
Oh!

776
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,271
Yes. Yes.

777
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:44,309
- Afternoon, men.
All right. Everything okay?
- Hello, Paul.

778
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,547
- Yes, fine.
- I'm afraid Jeffrey isn't here yet.

779
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,123
- Isn't he?
- Sorry.
- Oh, there he is.

780
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:56,120
-Hello. Sorry I'm late.
-Morning. It's all right. What happened?

781
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,665
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

782
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,735
Right. Now, um,
what's it to be?

783
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,670
- " For No One,'' right? " For No One.''
-" For No One.''

784
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,078
You find that all the words
of kindness linger on

785
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,880
When she no longer needs you

786
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,486
She wakes up
She makes up

787
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:27,221
She takes her time
and doesn't feel she has to hurry

788
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:29,831
She no longer needs you

789
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:34,197
And in her eyes
you see nothing

790
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:39,707
No sign of love
behind the tears cried for no one

791
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:44,268
A love that
should have lasted years

792
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,272
You want her
You need her

793
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,615
And yet you
don't believe her

794
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,248
When she says her love is dead
you think she needs you

795
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:12,369
And in her eyes
you see nothing

796
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:17,776
No sign of love
behind the tears cried for no one

797
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,340
A love that should have
lasted years

798
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,848
You stay home
She goes out

799
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,392
She says that long ago
she knew someone

800
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:34,019
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him

801
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,932
Your day breaks
Your mind aches

802
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:43,733
There will be times when all the
things you said will fill your head

803
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,807
You won't forget her

804
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:50,504
And in her eyes
you see nothing

805
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,810
No sign of love
behind the tears

806
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,646
Cried for no one

807
01:10:56,752 --> 01:11:00,586
A love that
should have lasted years

808
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,522
Mmm-mmm

809
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,963
Good. Lovely. Well, that was
rather nice, wasn't it?

810
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,095
I'd like to press on straight away
with the second piece. What was it?

811
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,174
- " Eleanor Rigby.''
- Yes. Good. Right.

812
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,142
Shall we go and do it immediately?
Soon as you like.

813
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:32,080
Watch it.

814
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,361
And running out of time too.

815
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,930
So as soon as possible, please.

816
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:48,059
One, two, three, four. One, two, three.

817
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:52,799
Ah, look at all
the lonely people

818
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:59,408
Ah, look at all
the lonely people

819
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,913
Eleanor Rigby

820
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:07,978
Picks up the rice in a church
where a wedding has been

821
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,282
Lives in a dream

822
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,190
Waits at the window

823
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:18,198
Wearing the face that she
keeps in a jar by the door

824
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,995
Who is it for

825
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:23,162
All the lonely people

826
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:27,231
Where do they all come from

827
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,335
All the lonely people

828
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:33,313
Where do they all belong

829
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,413
Father McKenzie

830
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:40,079
Writing the words to a sermon
that no one will hear

831
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,425
No one comes near

832
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,322
Look at him working

833
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:49,158
Darning his socks in the night
when there's nobody there

834
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,363
What does he care

835
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:55,437
All the lonely people

836
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:59,371
Where do they all come from

837
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,569
All the lonely people

838
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:06,637
Where do they all belong

839
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:11,243
Ah, look at
all the lonely people

840
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:18,418
Ah, look at
all the lonely people

841
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,826
Eleanor Rigby

842
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:27,925
Died in the church and was
buried along with her name

843
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,935
Nobody came

844
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,869
Father McKenzie

845
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:37,537
Wiping the dirt from his hands
as he walks from the grave

846
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,079
No one was saved

847
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:42,582
All the lonely people

848
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:46,211
Where do they all come from

849
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,449
-  All the lonely people
-  Ah, look at all the lonely people

850
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,823
Where do they all belong

851
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:43,810
his hands as he walks from the grave

852
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:51,979
No one was saved

853
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:12,439
All the lonely people

854
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,806
Come over here to me.

855
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:22,842
Where do they all come from

856
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:39,036
Ah, look at all the lonely people

857
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,954
That's it. You're finished.

858
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,087
What are you gonna do now?

859
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:32,030
What are you gonna do now?

860
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:35,102
That's it. You're finished.

861
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:37,501
What are you gonna do now?

862
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:40,597
Out. I'm goin' out.

863
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:04,363
If I ever get out ofhere

864
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:07,299
Thought of giving it all away

865
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,030
To a registered charity

866
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:12,629
All I need is a pint today

867
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,334
If I ever get out ofhere

868
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:18,640
If we ever get out ofhere

869
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:38,594
Well, the rain exploded
with a mighty crash

870
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,363
As we fell into the sun

871
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,372
And the first one said
to the second one there

872
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:50,342
I hope you're having fun

873
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,709
Band on the run

874
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:57,776
Band on the run

875
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:01,515
And thejailer man
and Sailor Sam

876
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,615
Were searching everyone

877
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,524
For the band on the run

878
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,689
Band on the run

879
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:16,967
For the band on the run

880
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:19,539
Band on the run

881
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:42,729
- Hello?
- Hello,Jim.

882
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,825
Oh, it's you.

883
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,698
What are you doing here?

884
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,864
Slumming, are we?

885
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,405
- Come in, son.
- Thanks.

886
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,944
Listen, you know
my mate Harry?

887
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,019
Did you notice him
in here last night?

888
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,556
- Is he the one who used to--
- Yes, but he doesn't anymore.

889
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:13,493
He was here for a while with
the rest of your crowd. Wasn't he?

890
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:17,053
Hmm. Did you notice
anything unusual?

891
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,325
No, nothing unusual.

892
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:23,301
Fancy a cup?

893
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:26,464
No, I won't, thanks.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

894
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,769
Uh, did he have
anything with him?

895
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:32,903
- No, I think he left her at home.
- No, a box.

896
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,780
A big blue one?

897
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,978
That's it.

898
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:44,988
- Did he leave alone?
- I suppose so.

899
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:50,530
You know how busy
we can get here some nights.

900
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:53,032
- I think he was on his own.

901
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:56,626
- How did he look?
- Wild as ever.

902
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:59,298
Sure you won't have a drop?

903
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:02,001
- Won't take a minute.
- Okay. Go on.

904
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:05,536
Always running around.

905
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:09,539
Don't get a chance
to see anybody.

906
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:13,915
If you didn't
run around so much...

907
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:17,150
you might get
a better view of the world.

908
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,317
Here you go.

909
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:29,692
Haste makes waste,
and waste not, want not.

910
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,931
That's what they say,
don't they, son?

911
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,134
What is this town
if full of care?

912
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:40,271
We have no time
to stop... and stare.

913
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:43,873
You see, I may not
look to you like a poet.

914
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:48,983
At first glance,
you mightn't think it.

915
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:56,422
- But the longer you look--

916
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:11,542
You wouldn't like to look at
some poems of mine, would you?

917
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:14,240
Thanks all the same,Jim,
but, uh...

918
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,340
- I've got to be off.

919
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:19,181
You've been off for years.

920
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,625
Cheerio, good fellow,
and well met.

921
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:30,323
Good night, sweet prince.

922
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:52,743
The long and winding road

923
01:30:54,115 --> 01:31:01,578
That leads to your door

924
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:08,929
Will never disappear

925
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:15,932
I've seen that road before

926
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,069
It always leads me here

927
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:32,452
Lead me to your door

928
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,920
Many times I've been alone

929
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,787
And many times I cried

930
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:43,258
Anyway you'll never know

931
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:46,800
The many ways I tried

932
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:51,200
But still they lead me back

933
01:31:52,607 --> 01:32:00,173
To the long
and winding road

934
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:06,852
You left me standing here

935
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:14,828
A long, long time ago

936
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:22,135
Don't keep me waiting here

937
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,843
Lead me to your door

938
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,860
The wild and windy night

939
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:57,769
That the rain washed away

940
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:05,837
Has left a pool of tears

941
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:13,586
Crying for the day

942
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:17,021
Oh oh oh

943
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:20,559
Don't leave me waiting here

944
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:22,686
Don't keep me waiting

945
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:28,966
Let me know the way

946
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,662
Ooh

947
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,139
Yeah,yeah,yeah

948
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,531
Good night, all.
I'm off to Broad Street.

949
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:42,134
And give my regards
to Broad Street

950
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:45,110
Remember me
to Leicester Square

951
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,544
Give my regards
to Broad Street, baby

952
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:51,277
'Cause you know that I'll be there
Oi!

953
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,275
I can wait another day

954
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:30,018
Until I call you

955
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:37,027
You've only got
my heart on a string

956
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:39,565
And everything aflutter

957
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:45,099
But another lonely night

958
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:48,107
Na na na na
Na na na na

959
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:51,007
Might take forever

960
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:53,672
Na na na na na na na

961
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:58,514
We've only got each other to blame

962
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,554
It's all the same to me, love

963
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:04,749
'Cause I know

964
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:06,951
What I feel

965
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,562
To be right

966
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:14,966
No more lonely nights

967
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,832
Never be another

968
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,668
No more lonely nights

969
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:26,140
You're my guiding light

970
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:30,445
Day or night
I'm always there

971
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:36,012
And I won't go away
until you tell me so

972
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:39,581
No, I'll never go away

973
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,971
-   Yes, I know
-  I know

974
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,710
-   What I feel
-  I feel

975
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:08,880
-   To be right
-  Be right

976
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:12,322
No more lonely nights

977
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:14,393
Never be another

978
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:17,520
No more lonely nights

979
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:23,501
You're my guiding light

980
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:27,665
Day or night
I'm always there

981
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:32,906
And I won't go away
until you tell me so

982
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:36,847
No, I'll never go away

983
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:43,450
No more lonely nights
No, no

984
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:47,447
...seemed so far away

985
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:49,522
Now it looks as though
they're here to stay

986
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:52,217
Oh, I believe in yesterday

987
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:58,861
Well, suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be

988
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,934
There's a shadow
hanging over me

989
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:03,902
Though I believe
in yesterday

990
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:05,972
Why she had to go

991
01:39:06,073 --> 01:39:09,167
I don't know
She wouldn't say

992
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:11,403
I said something wrong

993
01:39:11,512 --> 01:39:13,844
Now
God bless you, squire. Thank you, sir.

994
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,349
Oh, yesterday
all my troubles seemed so far away

995
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:20,147
Thank you, ma'am.
Never knew what to say

996
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:25,419
Oh, I believe
in yesterday

997
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:54,611
Help.!

998
01:39:59,626 --> 01:40:03,255
- Help.!

999
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:09,766
Help.!

1000
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,277
- Harry?

1001
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:29,050
Oh-- Oh! It's you.

1002
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:31,623
What are you doin' here?

1003
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:35,957
It locks from the outside.
I couldn't get out. Banged all night.

1004
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,791
Fell asleep.

1005
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,267
- Oh, you've got the tapes.
- Yeah, found 'em on the bench.

1006
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:46,168
- They all right?
- Yeah.

1007
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:48,468
It was dark.

1008
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:51,703
And cold.
Train never came.

1009
01:40:54,948 --> 01:40:57,348
Thought it was a toilet.

1010
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:10,262
You silly boy.
Come along.

1011
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,985
- All right, here.

1012
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,428
- Do you know what this is worth?

1013
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:48,160
- Look at the time.
He's two hours late already.

1014
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:50,236
- This might be him.

1015
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:53,238
- Hello?
- Guess what I found.

1016
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,276
- The tapes?
- And Harry, locked up
on Broad Street Station.

1017
01:41:57,377 --> 01:42:00,175
- What?
- It's a long story.
I'll tell you when I get back.

1018
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,182
- I'll ring Stephen.
- Yeah, ring them all.
See ya later. Love you.

1019
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,185
-  Ring 'em all Ring 'em all
-  Ring 'em all

1020
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:14,194
Hey! They found the tapes!

1021
01:42:14,328 --> 01:42:16,353
They found the tapes!

1022
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:24,534
Gentlemen... I'm sure
you'd like to be the first to know.

1023
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,232
We got the tapes.

1024
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:40,313
The long and the short
and the tall

1025
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:18,514
You're a long way away, mate.

1026
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:21,093
Oh, yeah.
I must have been daydreaming.

1027
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:25,790
- How we doing? Yeah?
Still got plenty of time.

1028
01:43:31,004 --> 01:43:33,598
- Have you seen Harry?
- Yeah, he's around somewhere. Why?

1029
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:36,876
Nothing really.

1030
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:09,571
I can wait another day

1031
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:15,104
Until I call you
Call you, call you

1032
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:18,912
You've only got
my heart on a string

1033
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:22,887
And everything aflutter
Ooh

1034
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:26,517
But another lonely night

1035
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:30,563
-   Might take forever
-  Forever, forever

1036
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:34,600
We've only got
each other to blame

1037
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:38,034
It's all the same to me, oh

1038
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:41,904
No more lonely nights

1039
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,139
No more lonely nights

1040
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:50,407
You're my guiding light

1041
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:53,714
I don't want
no more lonely nights

1042
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,514
May I never miss the thrill

1043
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,594
Ofbeing near you
Near you, near you

1044
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:07,224
If it takes
a number of years

1045
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:09,768
I'll turn your tears away

1046
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,003
But another lonely night

1047
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:18,942
Might take forever
Forever, forever

1048
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:22,812
We've only got
each other to blame

1049
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:27,785
It's all the same to me
Ooh-ee-ee,yeah

1050
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:30,049
No more lonely nights

1051
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:34,420
No more lonely nights

1052
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:38,621
You're my guiding light

1053
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:42,259
Oh, no more lonely nights

01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:01,151
Yeah, no more lonely nights

1055
01:46:02,622 --> 01:46:05,022
No more lonely nights

1056
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,654
You're my guiding light

1057
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:13,164
I don't want

1058
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:16,360
Oh

1059
01:46:28,782 --> 01:46:32,411
But another lonely night
Ooh

1060
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:34,646
Might take forever

1061
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:40,157
We've only got
each other to blame

1062
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:45,095
But it's all
the same to me

1063
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,894
No more lonely nights

1064
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,660
No more lonely nights

1065
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:55,600
You're my guiding light

1066
01:46:55,742 --> 01:47:00,304
Babe, I don't want
no more lonely nights

1067
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:04,307
I couldn't take it again

1068
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:08,446
I ain't lonely
I couldn't take it

1069
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,115
I couldn't take it again

1070
01:47:13,627 --> 01:47:15,492
No more

1071
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:17,893
May I never miss the thrill

1072
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:20,733
Ofbeing near you

1073
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:23,064
Near you, near you

1074
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:26,401
And if it takes
a number of years

1075
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,633
I'll turn your tears away

1076
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:34,638
I can wait another day

1077

You've only got
my heart on a string

1079
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:43,990
And everything aflutter

1080
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:45,887
Aflutter, aflutter

1081
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:49,325
But another lonely night

1082
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:51,829
Might take forever

1083
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:53,661
Forever, forever

But it's all

1086
01:47:59,573 --> 01:48:02,440
To me, to me

1087
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:05,010
No more lonely nights

1088
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,710
No more lonely nights
