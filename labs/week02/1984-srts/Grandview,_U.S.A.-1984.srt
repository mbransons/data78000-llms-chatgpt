1
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,274
Don't you ever do that again.

2
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,941
Remember the lever
on the steering column, move it,

3
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,108
you can put the wheel
wherever you want.

4
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,346
But don't move it while you're driving.

5
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,752
Okay, Dad. Dad, I'm gonna be late.

6
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,257
Square one's for the ignition,
round one's for the trunk

7
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,554
and don't forget to lock it.

8
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,604
Tim, I forgot to tell you.

9
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,864
Last button on the arm,

10
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,565
that locks up all the windows
and the doors.

11
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,211
And, uh, look, don't put any scratches
on the car, okay?

12
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,482
- Uh, drive carefully.
<i>- Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

13
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,524
I love you.

14
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,163
Kiss me.

15
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,445
- Chris.
- That's a real honey of a car.

16
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,643
Mom.

17
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,380
You'll be driving a Cadillac yourself
one of these days.

18
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,786
- Please.
- Yeah, we'll see.

19
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,982
Hi, Tim.

20
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,322
Goodness,
what a fine-looking couple you are.

21
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,987
You look like you just stepped off
of a wedding cake.

22
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,189
We really gotta go.

23
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,062
Just one more, just one more.

24
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,930
Oh, it just gives me goosebumps
looking at the two of you.

25
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,667
Oh, sorry, Bonnie.

26
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,377
<i>Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>

27
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,839
Ugh. Damn it.

28
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,450
You just hold on, it'll work.
Here, give me the pliers.

29
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,249
- Ow, Mom.
- What'd I tell you about that gum?

30
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,952
- I don't know, what?
- I said, no more gum.

31
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,257
You got that?

32
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,299
Sick of you gnawing on that,
not being hungry at supper time.

33
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,062
- That's not so.
- Wait a minute, fella.

34
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,263
You just go on. Get out of here.

35
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,601
Go on, vamoose.

36
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,174
Find anything, Mr. Hurlbuck?

37
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,438
Yes, ma'am, a few things.

38
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,280
Yeah, like what?

39
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,579
Like smoking in a food service area.

40
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,172
This is The Moose,

41
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,036
feeling, oh, so mellow and loose.

42
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,441
So put your arms around
your favorite memory

43
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,478
and hold it close.

44
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,913
Two heads beating as one.

45
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,780
Dancing the night away.

46
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,431
Let's go for a drive.

47
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,279
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

48
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,451
You got 30 days to comply
and bring these violations up to code.

49
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,487
You write me up on everything
but the color of the toilet paper,

50
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,123
expect me to fix it
in 30 days?

51
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,417
If you need more time,

52
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,993
you'll have to appeal
to the county commissioners.

53
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,097
How come all of a sudden
you're out here nosing around?

54
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,704
- Just doing my job.
- Yeah?

55
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,771
You tell the boys
at the county commission

56
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,340
I said you did a real good job too.

57
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,111
You ought to get smart

58
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,082
Hey, Slam, how you been?

59
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,515
Who was that?

60
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,746
Just more trouble.

61
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,218
Thanks.

62
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,637
- Mm, Bonnie
- Oh, Tim.

63
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,140
- Bulls.
- Tin.

64
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,642
- Are we moving?
- Everything is moving.

65
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,775
The whole world is moving.

66
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,243
Bonnie, the whole car is moving.

67
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,222
- Oh, no. No.
- Tim, what's happening?

68
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,156
- Damn, the car is sinking.
- Huh?

69
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,057
<i>- Please fasten your seatbelt.</i>
- Do something.

70
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,597
Oh, God.

71
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,567
Come on, come on.

72
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,902
Dear God.

73
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,338
This is really mature, Tim.

74
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:33,146
- Holy shit.
- Don't forget your keys.

75
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,808
Tim, where you going?

76
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,853
- I gotta go get some help.
- What about me?

77
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,320
You're not gonna leave me here,
are you?

78
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,787
Okay, okay.

79
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,817
Come on.

80
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,891
Please don't get mud on my dress.

81
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,293
Hold on. Whoa.

82
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,933
My father's going to kill me.

83
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,763
No, my father's gonna kill you.

84
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,337
- I lost my shoe.
- Tim.

85
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:59,101
- Damn it, I lost my shoe.
- Forget the shoe.

86
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,774
You dorkwipe.

87
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,374
Found my shoe.

88
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:11,516
<i>This is so mature.
This is ridiculous. Oh, my God.</i>

89
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,089
Look at my dress, it's wrecked.

90
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,623
Destroyed.

91
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,988
And my panty hose,
look at my panty hose.

92
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,185
Bonnie, can it.

93
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,195
- Where are we going?
- Getting a tow truck.

94
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,561
- Here?
- You wanna walk two miles into town?

95
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,498
Go right ahead, knock yourself out.

96
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,332
Why are you treating me like this?
What have I done?

97
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,168
- You're acting like a pig.
- Bonnie, I'm warning you, can it.

98
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,742
Okay, fine.
I'll just call my father then.

99
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,505
Fine, go ahead and call him.

100
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,047
Shit. Give me a break.

101
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,378
<i>He does have the advantage.</i>

102
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,884
<i>That's right.
A lot of his fans are booing him,</i>

103
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,181
<i>they must love him.</i>

104
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,516
Excuse me.

105
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,352
And behind him, Adam Bomb.

106
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,619
Jesus H. Casper the Ghost.

107
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,319
What the hell happened to you?

108
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,827
Had car trouble.
I'm looking for a tow truck.

109
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,592
Looks like you need a car wash.

110
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,530
<i>He's loaded for action, ready to fire.</i>

111
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,973
We got a tow truck,
but you'll have to talk to Mike first.

112
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,272
- Where's Mike?
- Inside, watching the derby.

113
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,846
Is it okay if I go in?

114
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
Sure, honey, for 3 bucks,
anybody can go in.

115
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,018
<i>Heck of a show.
Lots of blood and heavy metal.</i>

116
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,080
Forget it. Go on in.

117
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,720
Thank you.

118
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,656
You're welcome.

119
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,328
<i>And here come
the two Banzai Brothers.</i>

120
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,508
Where's Mike Cody?

121
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,006
Up there.

122
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,879
<i>Maybe we'll see some of that tonight.</i>

123
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,037
<i>- Ha, ha.
- And behind him...</i>

124
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,878
- I'm looking for Mike Cody.
- I'm Mike Cody, what do you want?

125
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,417
I need a tow truck.

126
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,111
What's wrong with your car?

127
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,348
It stalled in a stream.

128
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,718
Stalled in a stream?

129
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,826
Kind of half in and half out.

130
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,928
<i>We're gonna have
one heck of a melee.</i>

131
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,564
Damn.

132
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,826
- You got any money?
- How much?

133
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,104
- Twenty if I don't get wet, 30 if I do.
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

134
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,467
All right, gotta wait a minute.

135
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,768
<i>Take a last look,
give a round of applause</i>

136
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,572
<i>one last time
before we start this race.</i>

137
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,842
<i>And here comes the favorite.</i>

138
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,038
Slam Webster.

139
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,082
<i>Slam "The Ram" Webster.</i>

140
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,143
- <i>Slam, Slam, Slam.</i>
- Yeah.

141
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,413
<i>Slam, Slam, Slam.</i>

142
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,116
There's my favorite boy out there.

143
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,485
He's gonna do a real good job.

144
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,149
I'm glad you like him.

145
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,990
<i>Uh-oh, here comes the one in black,
Darth Vader.</i>

146
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,360
<i>We're gonna start
the countdown right now.</i>

147
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:44,331
Five, four, three, two, one.

148
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,470
<i>And they're off. There they go.</i>

149
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,680
<i>I kind of like that Vader</i>

150
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,840
<i>with that there red car,
beautiful paint job.</i>

151
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,418
<i>He's gonna fly
on the wheel stack again.</i>

152
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,522
<i>Red Baron wants to take on
the entire left side of the field.</i>

153
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,782
<i>Here comes Slam-- Oh!</i>

154
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,127
<i>Adam Bomb wants some,
he's right in the middle.</i>

155
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,592
<i>- Oh, beautiful hit.</i>
- Ha, ha.

156
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,824
<i>Slam Webster,
ladies and gentlemen. Slam Webster.</i>

157
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,232
<i>Slam just hit them both,
knocking them both in a circle.</i>

158
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,564
<i>Beautiful hit.</i>

159
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,436
<i>Beautiful, that was so hard,
it's worth seven points.</i>

160
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,346
<i>There goes one,
it's up and over into another car.</i>

161
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,488
<i>Slam's got Pink Slip in his sights.</i>

162
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,215
<i>- Oh! Beautiful hit from Slam Webster.
- Ha, ha.</i>

163
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,825
<i>Pink Slip is out of this race.</i>

164
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,587
<i>Two running cars on the track left.</i>

165
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,890
<i>And that is, of course,
Slam "The Ram" Webster</i>

166
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,057
<i>and the Chief of Police,
Darth Vader.</i>

167
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,735
<i>Slam doesn't see him,
he's coming from behind. Oh!</i>

168
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,232
<i>Slam didn't even see
that one coming, beautiful.</i>

169
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,701
<i>Out of the way. He made it.</i>

170
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,504
<i>Now, he's gonna finish him off.</i>

171
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,810
<i>- Bam! That is it, that is it.
- Ha, ha.</i>

172
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,849
<i>Beautiful hit from a backdoor driver.</i>

173
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,281
Yeah, Slam!

174
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,120
<i>The Force isn't with him
this evening.</i>

175
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,749
The old Darth Vader, Tucker Smith,
bites the dust.

176
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,565
<i>Start it up for the one and the only,
Slam "The Ram" Webster.</i>

177
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,701
- Great, Slam.
- Attaboy.

178
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,667
Thank you, thank you,
don't applaud, throw money.

179
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,669
Slam!

180
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,104
And that's all for tonight here at--

181
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,876
That is it, Mike.

182
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,537
I am a human being, not a light bulb.

183
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,042
I'll be right back.

184
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,724
Whew! I think I know who you're
looking for, he's up there.

185
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,326
- Oh, no.
- That's my daughter.

186
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,854
Never again, Tim Pearson.

187
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,259
Never in one million,
trillion goddamn years.

188
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,797
It was an accident, Mr. Clark.

189
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,765
What kind of demented cabbage patch
do you think I hopped out of?

190
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,960
- Look at her!
- Dad.

191
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,629
She looks like she was dragged
through a goddamned barnyard.

192
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,837
- Horny little ba--
- Dad.

193
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,478
- Easy.
- Come on, lover boy.

194
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,443
- Come on, you son of a b-!
- Enough, mister.

195
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,081
This is between us, sweetheart

196
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,917
Look buddy, I'll give you 60 seconds
to get off my property

197
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,451
or I'll kick your tiny nuts
up your big fat ass.

198
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,644
Sorry, Tim.

199
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,485
- Oh, boy.
- All right, let's go, missy.

200
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,126
I'm not gonna forget this, Pearson.

201
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,228
You too, sweetheart

202
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,331
You Roger Pearson's son?

203
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,989
Yeah.

204
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,462
Hey, hey.

205
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,562
Did I miss a good fight?

206
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,999
Wanna earn 30 bucks?

207
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,104
What did you have in mind?

208
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,800
Cut it out, give junior here a tow.

209
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,179
Man, I feel so stupid.

210
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,651
Well, boy, you just discovered
the oldest sexual position in the book.

211
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,845
What?

212
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,217
The foolish position.

213
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,687
I gotta pull over for a minute.

214
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,987
What you just gotta remember,

215
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,325
your brains are between your ears
and not your legs.

216
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,256
Hey, Slam.

217
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,037
Things a little rough
at the Speedrome tonight?

218
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,228
Yeah, ha, ha.

219
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,738
My friend here had a problem
out at County Line Bridge.

220
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,442
Oh. Out there baiting your hook, huh?
Catch anything?

221
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,842
Damn.

222
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,546
How's that gorgeous honey
of a wife of yours doing, huh?

223
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,814
- You tell me.
- Come again?

224
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,487
- She wasn't here tonight, was she?
- I don't wanna get messed up--

225
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,026
She wasn't here tonight,
was she, Mickey?

226
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,130
No.

227
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,824
I'll see you.

228
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,231
Hey, Mickey.

229
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,583
Slam?

230
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,058
Slam, that you?

231
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,889
No, it's a burglar.

232
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,860
It's late, baby.

233
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,269
So how did you do bowling tonight?

234
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,203
Claire beat me three times in a row.

235
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,391
Let's go to bed, baby.

236
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,943
Hey, thanks.

237
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,411
How did we do tonight?

238
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,482
Oh, you know.

239
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,889
Five, six, seven...

240
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,125
This ain't no way
to make a living anymore.

241
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,410
Watch it.
Looks like you had a rough night.

242
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,578
You look pretty lonely,
sitting there all beat up.

243
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:37,523
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I'm gonna take you to junk heaven.

244
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,314
Oh, my God.

245
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,921
It's not as bad as it looks, Dad.

246
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,599
<i>A door is ajar.</i>

247
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,444
You should've sold out, Michelle,
when your dad died.

248
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,677
Look, what if we just cut it in half?

249
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,220
- Five thousand?
- I'm sorry, Michelle, but it's business.

250
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,790
At this rate, you'll be out of business
by the end of the summer.

251
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,893
All your suppliers have
you on a cash basis.

252
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,053
- There is no--
- Thanks for your time, Mr. Fleming.

253
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,339
Hi.

254
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,137
- Hi.
- How are you today?

255
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,744
Fine.

256
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,278
Thanks for helping me out last night.

257
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,777
- It's okay.
- Really.

258
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,145
- Okay.
- I mean it.

259
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,145
Look, I'll see you.

260
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,487
That's a big thermometer.

261
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:19,921
Yup.

262
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,729
- You want it?
- No.

263
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,667
No, no, no, come on, take it.
They're giving them away free.

264
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,933
Great.

265
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,305
You know, I've always been interested
in the weather.

266
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,104
I bet.

267
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,148
Smooth, Pearson.

268
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,952
The weather?

269
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,251
Duh.

270
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,890
- Dad?
- I'll be right out.

271
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,932
<i> February, 4720.
That's up a dollar three.</i>

272
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,470
<i>February pork bellies up 187
at 6127.</i>

273
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,837
<i>December five came up 47
at 6267.</i>

274
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,942
<i>Farm report is brought to you hourly
by Gordon Chemical.</i>

275
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,549
<i>Your one stop store
for an feed and fertilizer needs.</i>

276
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,207
<i>Back to our musical programming.</i>

277
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,014
Dad, I'm sorry about your car.

278
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,916
You know, a father loaning his car,
his first Cadillac, to his son,

279
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,858
now, that's not just a father loaning
any car to his son.

280
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,290
That's a father loaning a symbol
of his success,

281
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,695
achievement and victories to his son
and saying:

282
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,359
"Here, you take this Cadillac

283
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,005
and you drive it proudly
up the road of your dreams."

284
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,409
But, for chrissake,
don't park the son of a bitch

285
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,273
in the middle of a goddamn stream.

286
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,179
You understand what I'm getting at?

287
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,987
I think you're telling me you don't want
me to drive your Cadillac anymore.

288
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,589
I think we understand each other.

289
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,279
Damn it! You turd.

290
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,277
Thought you were gonna
swim to Bora Bora.

291
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,077
Ran out of air.

292
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,378
See any mermaids?

293
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,453
Just catfish.

294
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,156
And I'm so sick of catfish.

295
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,987
How am I gonna be
the next Jacques Cousteau

296
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,958
if I'm sitting in a cornfield?

297
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,598
Still haven't told
your old man yet, huh?

298
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,859
Gotta tell him you're gonna
turn down the scholarship.

299
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,527
Tell him in your valedictory address,
that would really fry his mind.

300
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:47,669
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow students, distinguished guests.

301
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,404
Today is a very special day.

302
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,576
Today is a day unlike any other day.

303
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,621
Today is the day
where we wave hello with one hand

304
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,121
and wave goodbye
with the other hand.

305
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,262
Dinner's on the table.

306
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,562
Thank you, Dad.

307
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,807
- Looks good.
- Oh, thanks.

308
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,974
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

309
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,311
What's wrong with you?

310
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,352
Nothing.

311
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,324
- I can't help it.
- Susan.

312
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,360
It's killing me, I can't help it.

313
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,863
The conversation is finished.

314
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,467
- What conversation?
- It's none of your business.

315
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,900
- Yeah, they're my boobs.
- Susan.

316
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,333
What boobs? You have boobs?

317
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,700
Can it.

318
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,000
See, Mom, that's what I mean.

319
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,542
You can't even tell I have anything
with this dumb thing on.

320
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,680
- We wear bras in this family, period.
- We do?

321
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,578
- I said can it.
- It's canned, it's canned.

322
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,878
- Took me 13 years to grow them-
- Oh, my God.

323
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,315
Just when they stem to show,

324
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,114
I have to smash them down
with a bra?

325
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,951
Better smashed than flopping.

326
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,251
I wish they'd flop.

327
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,655
I'd pay a million dollars
if they'd just wiggle a little.

328
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,058
- Susan, I'm warning you.
- They're my boobs, Mom.

329
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,290
- Breasts.
- Breast, boob, what's the difference?

330
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,628
- A lot in your case.
- Oh, sit on it.

331
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,825
- Susan.
- Tim.

332
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,026
All right.

333
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,234
The conversation is finished.

334
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,672
Some conversation.

335
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,176
I thought we'd have
a little get-together in the backyard

336
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,009
after the graduation exercises.

337
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,707
Oh, I don't wanna have a party.

338
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,113
Oh, sure you do.

339
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,776
Mom, I would really just like to-?

340
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,987
Oh, Dad, gross.

341
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,984
Excuse me.

342
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,471
<i>MTV Music Television.</i>

343
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,480
<i>We've got your favorite
video music in stereo.</i>

344
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,937
What are you guys doing here?

345
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,602
We just need a couple
of hundred thousand to tide us over.

346
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,941
All we've got left
is the condo in Bogotá.

347
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,412
I'm busy, leave me alone.

348
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,607
You can't do this to us,

349
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,616
not after all the things
we've done for you.

350
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,755
- Yeah, Tim.
- Johnny, take care of them.

351
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:53,946
Beat it.

352
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,600
Stick them up.

353
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,796
You got any gum?

354
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,233
What?

355
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,276
You got any gum?

356
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,639
No, sorry.

357
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,110
Damn.

358
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,717
You work here?

359
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,788
Yup, me and my ma.

360
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,188
She sells the hot dogs,
takes the ticket money.

361
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,422
I drive the forklift, that's my job.

362
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,567
Nobody can do it but me.

363
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,365
If you wanna drive in the derby,
what do you gotta do?

364
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,440
Just put it in reverse, go like crazy.
Ka-bam!

365
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,235
That's it, huh?

366
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,379
Smash them up.

367
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,343
- Where do you get the cars?
- I got some back there.

368
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,983
I got a...

369
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,345
What do they call it?

370
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,010
The front of it
looks like a rocket ship.

371
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,052
Studebakers,
you know, Studebakers?

372
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,247
Yeah, sure.

373
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,189
Well, it's kind of a Studebaker,
it's got a Buick engine in it.

374
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,953
It's a "Stud-a-Buick."

375
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,995
Here comes the Stud-a-Buick.

376
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,656
They don't make them anymore.
All out.

377
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,665
- You want that one?
- How much you want-??

378
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,599
You can't sell my cars, Cowboy,
you know that.

379
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,068
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

380
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,141
- Why not?
- Because they're mine, not yours.

381
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,332
They are too mine.

382
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,176
Look, just go back to the trailer
and I'll fix you supper.

383
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,508
I ain't hungry.

384
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,944
Just do what I say, go.

385
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,175
Now, go.

386
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,785
- Come here.
- What?

387
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,217
You got something in your ear.

388
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,255
Thanks, Mike.

389
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,290
I didn't mean to get him in any trouble.

390
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,486
You didn't.

391
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,687
What can I do for you?

392
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,992
- I wanna drive in the derby.
- Why?

393
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,329
I thought it'd be some fun,
that's all.

394
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,495
- You gotta be 18.
- No sweat, I turned 18 last month.

395
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,766
Look, some other time.

396
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,433
Does that mean no?

397
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,839
It means some other time.

398
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,345
If you don't take my word for it,
go ask your dad.

399
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,176
What does he have to do with it?

400
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,976
Go home.

401
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,183
<i>Back, back. Reach, reach, reach.</i>

402
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,158
<i>Take it down, now stretch.</i>

403
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,324
<i>You gotta work that body every day.</i>

404
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,365
<i>Now, come on,
what are you waiting for?</i>

405
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,558
Oh, hi.

406
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,864
- Dinner will be ready real soon.
- <i>Hold it down, hands up.</i>

407
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,942
<i>Side, side, side, side,
side, side, side.</i>

408
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,441
I must be adopted.

409
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,672
<i>Come on, hold that
stomach in, honey. Side, side.</i>

410
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,941
Dad, you know Mike Cody?

411
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,174
What about her?

412
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,841
I went to the Speedrome today to--

413
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,613
- I don't want you to go out there.
- Why?

414
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,381
I just don't, you got it?

415
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,956
Got what? What's going on?

416
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,821
Nothing is going on.

417
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,192
Do you have to resist everything
that I ever say to you?

418
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,697
I'm not resisting you,
I'd like something better than "no."

419
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,860
- You're resisting with that attitude.
- You always turn everything around.

420
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,471
Ah, don't use that <i>Psychology Today</i>
routine on me.

421
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,302
- I'm not in the mood for it.
<i>- Dinner's on.</i>

422
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,910
- Let's go eat.
- I'm not hungry.

423
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,607
Susan, let's eat.

424
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,411
Susan, let's eat!

425
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,452
You don't have to yell.
Why is everyone always yelling at me?

426
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,081
I'm not bothering anyone. I'm sick
of everyone always yelling at me.

427
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,523
Slam, there's a Hungry-Man
dinner in the oven.

428
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,723
Where you going?

429
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,166
- I told you.
- Told me what?

430
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,168
I'm going marketing, honey.

431
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,465
Dressed like that?

432
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,404
Well, I was gonna go naked
but my ass sticks to the car seat.

433
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,441
Bye, honey.

434
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,130
Well, hidey hidey ho, Mikey.

435
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,131
I haven't seen you in a long time.

436
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,826
Hey, Uncle Bob, how you doing?

437
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,026
My back's killing me.

438
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,173
Every time I piss, it burns like
I got a butane lighter stuck up my ass.

439
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,468
Otherwise, everything's just peachy.

440
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,406
How are you?

441
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,273
Making it.

442
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,772
What are you drinking tonight?

443
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,110
I'll have a beer.

444
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,876
You got it.

445
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,685
How's Aunt Winnie?

446
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,822
Oh, hell, she's fine.

447
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,892
I need to ask you a favor.

448
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,685
Shoot.

449
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,389
I need to borrow some money.

450
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,861
Okay.

451
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,194
How much you need, kiddo?

452
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,661
Ten thousand dollars.

453
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,338
Ten thousand?

454
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,940
Hmm. I love you, I truly do, but...

455
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:57,712
Oh, Winnie would pass a kidney stone
if I loaned you anything like that.

456
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,082
I know, you don't have to explain.

457
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,215
I know I don't, damn it, but I'm...

458
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,324
I'm just sorry.

459
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,488
- You were better off out in California--
- Oh, Bob, please.

460
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,462
Now, listen to me.

461
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,157
You are smart and you are pretty

462
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,929
and you could be or do almost
anything in the world you wanted to,

463
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,936
but no, no, no, not you.

464
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,574
You're gonna hold your head up high.

465
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,573
Let me just tell you something,

466
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,678
when you're neck deep in shit,
you got no choice-

467
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,610
- But to hold your head up high.
- But to hold your head up high.

468
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,510
I am my father's daughter.

469
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,554
Quiet down back there.

470
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,420
- Slam.
- Give me another round.

471
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,493
Listen, I'm gonna slam you
the hell out of here

472
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,027
if you break that damn game.

473
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,289
Give me another round.

474
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,626
No way, Jose.

475
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,099
- Oh, shit, I'll get it myself.
- Whoa.

476
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,735
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- I'm all right.

477
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,929
Yeah, bullshit.

478
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,574
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

479
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,643
- No.
- Look, do you wanna fight?

480
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,972
I don't hit women.

481
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,638
Good, I don't hit drunks.

482
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,909
Hey, I'm sorry, everybody.

483
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,349
There's only two kinds of drunks.

484
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,718
Those that are sorry
and those that soon will be.

485
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,415
You think you can handle him
all right?

486
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,083
Yeah, no problem.

487
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,593
If he gets antsy on you,

488
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,491
you just rap his head
on the pavement a couple of times.

489
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,275
What's that?

490
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,671
Five hundred dollars.

491
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,380
Winnie doesn't know about it.

492
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,779
The Internal Revenue
doesn't know about it.

493
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,149
Nobody knows about it
and that's just the way I wanna keep it.

494
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,687
- I can't take it.
- Sure you can.

495
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,882
Now just put it in your pocket.

496
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,591
Oh, goddamn it.

497
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,788
Come on.

498
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,594
Go on now. Get out.

499
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,599
Slam? Slam.

500
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,402
Wait a minute.

501
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,671
No, Slam, this way.

502
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,542
You love anybody, Mike?

503
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,484
Yeah, I guess so.

504
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,048
Did you ever love me?

505
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,353
You're drunk.

506
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,050
I know that.

507
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,364
I'm just asking you a question.

508
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,467
Hey, you know...

509
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,674
You are a beautiful woman.

510
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,104
Don't even think about it, Slam,

511
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,370
because I'll kick your ass
drunk or sober.

512
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,213
Goddamn, you're hostile.
I'm not gonna jump on you.

513
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,950
Couldn't get it up now if you were
a pair of twins in a vat of Mazola oil.

514
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,488
Stop it.

515
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,026
Wait, wait. Oh.

516
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,995
- Jeez.
- Ha, ha. Oops.

517
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:04,397
You remember that time we all went
skinny-dipping out at the lake?

518
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,036
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, come on, you know...

519
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,772
The night your old man caught us
trying to rip off a keg of beer

520
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,381
from the concession stand?

521
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,417
That was a long time ago, Slam.

522
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,022
Man.

523
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,856
I had a crush on you.

524
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,688
You always treated me
like I had the plague.

525
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,261
Because you're so goddamn weird.
You always scared the crap out of me.

526
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,934
Hell, you broke Glen Reynolds' nose
when he tried to get in your pants.

527
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,269
I didn't break yours.

528
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:46,508
No, you just broke my head when you
ran off with that jerk-off dopehead.

529
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,744
Mike?

530
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,647
Yeah?

531
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,927
It's okay, Slam.

532
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,451
Yo! Hey, what are you doing,
birdwatching or something?

533
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,289
What's wrong with you, you sick?

534
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:36,796
I don't know.

535
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,763
Maybe I ought to call it
and head home.

536
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,166
Yeah, maybe you ought to.
You don't look so hot.

537
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,650
Yeah, baby.

538
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,684
- Slide on in.
- Thank you, baby.

539
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,357
- Oh, shit.
- What?

540
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,017
- Ernie.
- Who?

541
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,823
- Ernie, Slam, my husband.
- Oh, no.

542
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,297
Start the car.

543
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,233
Out of the car, both of you, now.

544
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,899
Wait a second, Ernie.

545
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,544
I said, get out of the car.

546
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,680
- It's not what you--
- It's not what I what?

547
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,041
I suppose the greaseball there

548
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,376
is just a fucking figment
of my imagination, right?

549
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,986
Slam, this is Donny. We were just--

550
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,216
You were just boffing him
in my bed, weren't you?

551
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,559
In my goddamn bed
in my goddamn house!

552
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,532
I am warning you,
get out of the goddamn car now.

553
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,866
Hey, pal, why don't you just cool off
a few degrees?

554
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,333
You talking to me, pal?

555
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,375
Better move your truck, pal.

556
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,708
Move the pickup, right now.

557
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,871
What, do you think
you're going somewhere?

558
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,540
Get out of the car.

559
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,448
Damn it, move the pickup.

560
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,612
I'll give you to the count of five
to get out of that car.

561
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,849
- Stop it, Ernie.
- One.

562
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,687
- Get your hands off the car.
- Two.

563
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,927
Three.

564
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,998
Four, five.

565
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,190
Hey, I'm warning you.

566
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,927
Oh, yeah?

567
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,301
Stop it, you son of a bitch.

568
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,942
Just get out of the car, pal.

569
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,476
Fuck you, Jake, you're nuts.

570
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,668
Oh, yeah?

571
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,872
You wanna see nuts?
I'll show you nuts.

572
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,948
This is nuts, pal.

573
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,148
Oh, shit.

574
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,382
Ernie!

575
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:49,821
Oh, shit!

576
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,233
He's gone crazy.

577
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,131
He's gonna kill us.

578
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,571
- No, no!
- Let go, damn it.

579
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,730
- Let go.
- Don't shoot him.

580
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,270
Oh, damn it!

581
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,538
Oh, my God.

582
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,681
Candy, are you all right?

583
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,786
I shot him, I shot him.

584
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,717
Are you hit?

585
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,252
Does a duck have lips?

586
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,201
Okay, now you sure nobody wants
to press charges against nobody else?

587
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,433
Well, in that case, have a nice day.

588
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,977
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

589
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,846
Candy, look, hey.

590
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,646
You just stay away from me.

591
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,984
I'll get home on my own.

592
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,553
Hey.

593
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,569
Oh, shit.

594
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,077
What are you doing here?

595
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,140
I can't go home.

596
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,714
Did she kick you out?

597
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,083
Right on my ass.

598
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:56,692
Got some, uh, peace-bond thing
sworn out on me.

599
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,453
Not only can't I sleep
in my own bed with my own wife,

600
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,530
I gotta fucking stay
50 feet away from her.

601
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,563
Like I'm supposed to carry
a damned tape measure

602
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,133
around with me or something.

603
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,963
What happened?

604
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,139
Poor judgment on my part. Ha, ha.

605
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,038
- Did you beat her up?
- Hell no.

606
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,906
I beat up her boyfriend's car.

607
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,048
Sells washing machines
over in Cartersville.

608
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,413
He's one of these slick creeps

609
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,387
with all them gold chains
and a Coppertone tan.

610
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,389
You got the worst taste in women
of any man I've ever known.

611
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,224
Well, screw you and thanks a lot.

612
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,399
What, all of a sudden, you're an expert
on marriage, the divorced old maid?

613
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,062
At least
I'm not afraid of being alone.

614
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,795
Or whatever's
spooking you so bad,

615
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,906
you'd rather eat it
and babysit some little tease.

616
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,564
Oh, hell, Mike.

617
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,267
I know a lot of girls
playing the same game as Candy.

618
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,710
Suckering some airhead
like you into playing house.

619
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,508
She loves me, goddamn it.

620
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,516
That's why she's slipping and sliding
with a washing machine salesman?

621
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,849
Oh, jeez,
you are something else, woman.

622
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,217
I mean, she's young.

623
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,553
This guy, Danny or Dinky or Dipshit
or whatever the fuck his name is,

624
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,289
he's got her snowed over
with some act that she fell for.

625
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,729
- She doesn't know what she's doing.
- Bull.

626
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,596
You can't tell me
that I don't love her.

627
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,532
- You don't.
- Oh, goddamn it, Mike.

628
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,538
I love her.

629
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,440
She loves me, I mean--

630
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,302
I do things for her.

631
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,948
I shovel gravel five days a week
on some kidney-shaking machine

632
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,050
that gives me hemorrhoids
the size of watermelons.

633
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:32,915
Then you zip out here and spend every
minute away from her in the derby.

634
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,215
What am I supposed to do?

635
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,314
This place is the only thing
that makes me different

636
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,789
from almost everybody else.

637
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,430
I like to smash cars
and I am damn good at it.

638
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,332
You know,
you're telling the wrong woman.

639
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,579
You know, you shouldn't eat toast
with braces on your teeth.

640
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,914
Makes your mouth
look like a garbage disposal.

641
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,956
Looks like you're carrying
your lunch in there.

642
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,355
- God, you are so warped.
- Me?

643
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,191
You know, if puberty was a terminal
disease, you'd be the poster child?

644
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,594
- Go suck dead bicycle seats.
- Susan.

645
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,031
Are you on drugs?

646
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,536
What?

647
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,608
Whatever your problem is,
you better get yourself straight.

648
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,506
And, oh, by the way, don't forget,

649
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,238
you gotta wear a tie
and a jacket for the picture tonight.

650
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,041
What picture?

651
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,241
You got a brain up there
or a paperweight?

652
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,442
Dad, do I have to?

653
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,752
Yes, damn it, you have to.

654
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,322
I'm a county commissioner
and you're the class Valedictorian,

655
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,289
and we're gonna have our picture
taken whether you like it or not.

656
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,757
Yes, sir.

657
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,960
You better straighten out
that attitude of yours, mister,

658
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,397
or you and me
are gonna go to the mat.

659
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,566
If you don't realize,

660
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:02,973
I believe that the most important skill
you've acquired in this institution,

661
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,477
and I hope you have acquired it,

662
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,511
is the ability to communicate.

663
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,710
A language,
orally or the written word.

664
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,345
Dad!

665
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,321
- Go!
- Go, go!

666
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,819
No!

667
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,458
Tim.

668
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,183
<i>Tim.</i>

669
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,991
Sorry.

670
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,962
I was afraid you'd gone into a coma.

671
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,932
Hey, is he finished yet?

672
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,668
I don't know, I'm gonna go find out.

673
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,375
- I got your dress, Mike.
- Thanks, Cowboy.

674
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,039
- Are you going to a party?
- Mm-mm.

675
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,014
Going to county commission
meeting tonight.

676
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,381
- They gonna have ice cream there?
- No.

677
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,954
- They're not?
- Uh-uh.

678
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,091
I don't wanna go then.

679
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,921
Guess I have to go without you.

680
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,219
Guess so.

681
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,659
Put that in my trailer for me, okay?

682
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,094
- Hi, Slam.
- Hey, Cowboy, put them up.

683
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,428
- Mr. Kutch.
- Yo.

684
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,495
What do you say?

685
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,470
- For everything?
- Yup.

686
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,734
Including that pile of batteries
and tires back there?

687
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,844
- No, that's another deal.
- Hey there.

688
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,310
- Hi, Slam.
- How's it going?

689
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,410
Wait.
Look, I'm real busy right now.

690
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,815
- What's up?
- Uh...

691
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,586
I was just thinking that maybe
we could go out to dinner tonight.

692
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,717
I thought you were a married man.

693
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,793
Just dinner, that's all.

694
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,363
Getting even with Candy?

695
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,056
Damn it,
I'm not trying to get even,

696
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,530
I'm trying to ask you for a date.

697
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,397
You remember dates, don't you?

698
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,128
I never remember
you asking me for one.

699
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,966
This is going over
like a fad in church.

700
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,167
Say, 3000?

701
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,573
Three and a half.

702
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,270
Three and a half?

703
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,881
Hey look, I'll see you later, okay?

704
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,874
Look, Slam, I'd like to go.

705
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,713
Really, I'm just busy tonight.

706
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,153
Look, 3250
including the batteries and tires.

707
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,326
Three and a half with the tires
and batteries.

708
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,990
How about if we have a drink
after the derby tomorrow?

709
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,933
Yeah, sure, okay.
Yeah, if you want to.

710
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,660
- Okay.
- See you.

711
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,863
Three-and-a-half for everything,
including the batteries and tires?

712
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,063
Draw.

713
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,267
- Oh, you got me.
- I did?

714
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,605
Three and a half, take it or leave it.

715
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,509
I'll take it.

716
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,175
Okay.

717
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,822
That's the best you could do, huh?

718
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,251
Shirt tie, and jacket.

719
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,394
Yeah.

720
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,529
Dad, one of these days,
your stomach's gonna melt down.

721
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,191
It'll be like the China syndrome
and burn right through you.

722
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,234
Oh, that's a pleasant thought.

723
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,408
Dad, what would you think
if I didn't work for you this summer

724
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,406
- and I took some time off?
- Time off?

725
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,602
I need to do some things,
see some things.

726
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,145
Great, I'll sell the house,

727
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,180
we'll buy you a ticket
on the space shuttle.

728
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,340
- I'm being serious, Dad.
- Seriously disturbed.

729
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,113
I need to get away from here,
I need some time.

730
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,778
Let me tell you something.

731
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,757
Losers never have enough time,
winners have all the time in the world.

732
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,792
Oh, boy.

733
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,163
MAN: That makes you an exceptionally
high yield...

734
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,300
- Dad, listen to me-
- Oh, we're gonna be late.

735
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,267
Dad, I'm gonna turn down
that scholarship to ISU.

736
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,565
I wanna go to school in Florida
and study oceanography.

737
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,230
You what? Now you listen to me--

738
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,466
- Hey there--
- I got-

739
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,544
- Randy, how are you this evening?
- Evening. This'll just take a minute.

740
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:33,511
Let's step into the meeting hall.
I'll grab a few quick ones.

741
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,042
Who died, Tim?

742
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,221
Come on, let's have a smile.

743
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,585
That's it. Thank you, gentlemen.

744
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,357
Thank you, Randy. Our pleasure.

745
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,761
Once this meeting is over,
you and I are gonna sit down

746
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,925
and we're gonna get
our wires straight, you got it?

747
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,003
- I'll see you later.
- Wait a minute, hold on.

748
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,800
Here, go over to the office,
I got some Rolaids on the desk,

749
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,101
bring them over here, please.

750
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,039
Yes, sir.

751
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,579
Hi.

752
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,521
Where's Pete?
Did you hear from him?

753
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,214
Come on now. Sit down, Bill.

754
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,801
That's just another one of four
or five examples of, uh,

755
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,810
great potential
for personal injury.

756
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,973
And of course, the county would
be liable to lawsuit in those situations.

757
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,641
Guess that's just about all I've got.

758
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,377
Any questions?

759
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,984
Thank you, Larry.

760
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,149
Mike, Miss Cody, are there
any comments you'd like to make?

761
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:06,138
My dad built
the Speedrome in 1967,

762
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,833
and since then we've had our share
of cuts and bruises,

763
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:14,176
splinters and bumped heads,
but no more than any other business.

764
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,149
The only fatality we ever had
was when my dad died last year

765
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,752
of his head attack.

766
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,982
What I'm trying to get at

767
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:28,186
is that there's a big difference
between run-down and unsafe.

768
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,989
But I'll do whatever you want,
I just need the time.

769
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,431
I need time to raise the money
and do the repairs.

770
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,195
Now, I have some estimates here.

771
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,239
Well, in light of Mr. Hurlbuck's report
I myself have some difficulty

772
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,207
in seeing how we could go
about granting you more time.

773
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,903
Six months, just give me six months.

774
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,515
If I haven't done everything by then,
you can shut me down.

775
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,119
We're supposed to waive the interest
of the public safety for six months?

776
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,186
That would leave the county
in a tough position.

777
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,449
Look, can we cut the crap?

778
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,253
What's going on is you
wanna put me out of business.

779
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,724
Let's keep our hats on.

780
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,659
I move that we vote on the motion
before us.

781
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:03,854
All in favor of granting--

782
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,524
I don't quit so easy, Mr. Pearson,
you ought to know that by now.

783
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,036
Especially since you've had your eye
on my dad's property since he died.

784
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,401
My bags weren't unpacked,
his body wasn't cold yet

785
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,100
and you were on my doorstep
doing your Let's <i>Make a Deal</i> routine.

786
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,268
- I resent that, that has no bearing on-
- On what?

787
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,575
That you've managed to buy or option
every piece of property around me?

788
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,150
Now you'll either calm yourself
or I'll adjourn this meeting

789
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,650
and we'll vote on this in private.

790
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,811
Just tell me why you wanna
shut me down so damn bad,

791
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,151
you'd use this line of bullshit to do it.

792
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,452
Because they want to build
a Country Club there.

793
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:36,257
It's all right here, they wanna build
a golf course and a club house.

794
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,162
You not only blew my ass
out of the water, Mr. Smart Guy,

795
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,306
you blew your own ass sky-high.

796
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,204
If this deal falls through
and I'm left holding the bag,

797
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,470
I am bankrupt, busted, kaput.

798
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,977
Can we have a word with you,
Roger?

799
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,581
Uh, yeah, I'll be right with you,
George.

800
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,442
Oh, goddamn it to hell.

801
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,282
This was my dream,
you and me sitting pretty

802
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,980
with our own development
of fine homes

803
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,787
surrounding a private country club
with a state-of-the-an golf course.

804
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,488
And now, thanks to you,
I have a half a dozen chicken farms

805
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,032
surrounding a goddamn
demolition derby.

806
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,400
Honesty's the best policy,
remember that one, Dad?

807
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,007
Liars are losers,
remember that one, Dad?

808
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,198
Why you little...

809
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,345
We'll finish this at home.

810
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,283
No, we'll finish it here,
because I'm not going home.

811
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,851
And there's got to be a way
to smooth things down.

812
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,295
You okay?

813
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,199
Yeah, thanks.

814
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,464
Where you going?

815
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,437
I'm just going.

816
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,042
Look, I appreciate what you did.

817
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,671
I mean it.

818
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,652
I'm going to Ruby's.

819
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,318
You want a hamburger?

820
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,864
Why did you do it?

821
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,565
Do what?

822
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,438
Save my ass like that.

823
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,672
This stuffs terrible.

824
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,976
Tasty but terrible.

825
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,745
When I was in high school,
we started this big rumor

826
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,481
that the burgers here
were made out of horse meat.

827
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,285
- Horse meat?
- Mm-hm.

828
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,494
Business sort of slacked off here
for a while.

829
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,532
- Would you do me a favor?
- Sure.

830
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,074
If I gave you the money,
would you buy me a bottle of wine?

831
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,609
Thanks, Kay.

832
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,754
- Your change is in the sack.
- Thank you.

833
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,924
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Get smashed.

834
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,227
- At home?
- Are you kidding?

835
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,094
Where you gonna go?

836
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,894
Probably to the park.

837
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,463
You know,
if you need a place to crash...

838
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,232
I'll be all right.

839
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,006
Okay. Thanks.

840
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,825
- You sure?
- Yeah.

841
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,232
Hey!

842
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,769
You got a corkscrew at your place?

843
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,456
So where did you get this?

844
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,893
- California.
- California?

845
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,623
I used to live there
with my husband.

846
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,157
You're married?

847
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,127
Divorced.

848
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,603
Hit the spot?

849
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,545
Yeah.

850
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:48,441
So how old are you?

851
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,243
Twenty-seven.

852
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,014
Are you sensitive about your age?

853
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,589
No.

854
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,385
You just don't like
to talk about it, right?

855
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,651
Right.

856
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,854
Why did you come back here?

857
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,262
In California,
everybody's from someplace else.

858
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,960
Everybody from here is from here.

859
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,899
I like that.

860
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,373
I like this town.

861
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:26,214
I like this town too,
it's just I can't do what I want here.

862
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,236
- So is this you?
- What?

863
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,002
This picture.

864
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,771
Yeah. When I was a little girl,

865
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,377
my dad told me that I was
the last living descendant

866
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,852
of Wild Bill Cody, I should be proud.

867
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,658
Something to brag about, he said.

868
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,964
When I was about 13,
I did some digging.

869
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,166
Found out
that there was a Buffalo Bill Cody

870
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,233
and a Wild Bill Hickcock.

871
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:23,569
Whoever the hell Wild Bill Cody was,
he wasn't my relative.

872
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,275
I was just Mike Cody.

873
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:31,418
And my old man was full of beans.

874
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,362
You know,
I never told him I knew that.

875
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,329
I never did.

876
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,309
Do you want to drive in the derby
tomorrow night?

877
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,312
I don't have a car.

878
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,950
I got cars.

879
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,122
Yeah. All right.

880
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,636
- Mike.
- Here I come.

881
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,434
<i>Toro, toro, come on.</i>

882
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,545
Come on, get in.

883
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,615
Hey, wait a minute.

884
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:21,957
Yeah.

885
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,275
Never hit the driver's door,
it's like a gentlemen's agreement.

886
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,879
What?

887
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,103
<i>Good morning, Grandview.</i>

888
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,681
<i>Temperature's 72 degrees,
it's 7:00 am.</i>

889
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,909
<i>Just a reminder
that an the float entries</i>

890
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,553
<i>for tomorrow's big
Memorial Day parade</i>

891
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,552
<i>must be registered
with the Chamber of Commerce</i>

892
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,746
<i>before noon today.</i>

893
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:26,416
<i>And, boy, it's gonna be
a swell parade this year.</i>

894
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,026
Don't you ever get tired?

895
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,599
I got a lot of hormones.

896
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,999
Yeah, well, my hormones
are all worn out.

897
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,571
So, what are you going to do?

898
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,271
Right now? Today?

899
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:50,179
And tomorrow and the next day.

900
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:56,288
There's this guy I know up in Chicago,
he runs this, uh, scuba diving school.

901
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,890
I figured I'd go up there and get a job

902
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:05,591
and then I want to go to Florida
to do this dolphin study thing.

903
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:08,326
Why don't you just go straight
to Florida?

904
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:13,334
Because I would be lucky
to swing the bus ticket to Chicago.

905
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,176
What?

906
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,621
I forgot the advantages
of being an 18-year-old girl.

907
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,849
Doing it in cars?

908
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,857
Doing it with 18-year-old guys.

909
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,621
You expecting somebody?

910
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,290
They're here to pick up the cars.

911
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:44,597
I'm selling all my cars. Shit, I forgot.

912
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,706
All right, all right, hold your horses.

913
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,207
Hold yours too.

914
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,611
- Slam.
- Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.

915
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,911
What are you doing here?

916
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:00,384
I woke up this morning,
got dressed, drove over to Ruby's

917
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,113
like I've done
a million goddamn times,

918
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:05,249
especially since Candy couldn't
cook anything that wasn't frozen

919
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,325
or sealed in petroleum byproducts,

920
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,430
and I suddenly realized that I would
rather eat a maggot casserole

921
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,192
than gag on one more chili dog.

922
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:17,304
So here we got the makings of a real
old-fashioned American breakfast.

923
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,805
We got bacon,
we got eggs, real eggs,

924
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:27,039
we got spuds for some home fries,
we got orange juice,

925
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,240
we got Maxwell House coffee,
good to the last drop,

926
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:33,353
and last but not least,
Hillbilly Bread, it's colossal.

927
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,887
None of this whole wheat
hippie rabbit food bullshit.

928
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,218
Just plain old white bread.

929
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,294
Shit, goddamn, you're making it
with a high school kid?

930
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,493
Calm down.

931
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,606
What the hell
am I supposed to do, huh?

932
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,038
Make breakfast in bed
for the two of you?

933
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,973
All you had to do was call first.

934
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:00,205
Sure, so you could hand me
some crap about being busy.

935
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,681
I'm so fucking dumb.

936
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,183
That's the reason you couldn't
go outwith me last night?

937
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,014
No, that's not why.

938
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,621
Bullshit.

939
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,388
Look, I'm sorry. Can we just talk?

940
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,166
You piss me off!

941
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,011
Hey, back to work.

942
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,919
Kind of messed things up for you,
didn't I?

943
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,024
It's not your fault.

944
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,484
I'm sorry.

945
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,357
It's not your fault.

946
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,265
He gets kind of mad, doesn't he?

947
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,933
He was born mad.

948
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,307
I'm really sorry.

949
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,910
I---

950
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,843
I'm gonna go into town.

951
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,382
- Take the tow truck.
- It's okay, I can hitch.

952
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,884
No, it's okay, I have to stick around
here all day anyway.

953
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,733
Pull out the choke.

954
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,444
You want anything from town?

955
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,048
Nope.

956
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,645
See you later.

957
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,833
Ain't sex great?

958
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,007
Move it.

959
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,804
School is out!

960
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,121
You all right?
Where the hell have you been?

961
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,163
Thought you had an accident
or got sick or drunk or went dippy

962
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:06,698
and jumped into the water.

963
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:10,065
And what is this business about
ditching your last day of school?

964
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,263
I'm leaving, Dad.

965
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,806
I'm catching the bus to Chicago.

966
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,972
That's the way it ends,
I mean, you just, uh--

967
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:20,739
You run away?

968
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,075
No, I'm just leaving.

969
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,876
Look, Tim.

970
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,552
All right,
maybe I went a bit overboard

971
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,088
and I did things
the way I shouldn't have

972
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,419
and you got a right to be mad.

973
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,687
I don't know what to say.

974
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,330
Look, business is hard,

975
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,126
sometimes you get off center
and you screw up.

976
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,468
All right, I'm sorry, damn it,
I am sorry.

977
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:49,872
Look, give ISU a year,
just a year, give it a shot

978
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,479
and after that we'll talk about
the, uh, oceanography thing.

979
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,513
No, thanks.

980
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,117
Well, damn it,
what's wrong with this town anyway?

981
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:02,554
Nothing, and maybe I'll come back
here sometime, Dad.

982
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,089
But if I do, it'll be because I want to,

983
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,523
not because I'm afraid
of the rest of the world.

984
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,323
That's what I hate about Grandview,
is all the bull that says:

985
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,592
"Don't go out there, you won't make it,
they'll eat you alive."

986
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,898
Well, I don't buy it.

987
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,843
That's my valedictory speech.

988
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,116
<i>This is the
answering machine of Candy Webster.</i>

989
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,121
<i>Ernie Webster no longer resides
at this number.</i>

990
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,782
<i>- Thank God.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

991
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,225
<i>So just wait for the beep
and leave a message. Bye.</i>

992
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:45,991
Yeah, this is, uh,
Ernie Webster speaking.

993
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,897
I'm coming by tomorrow to pick up
my clothes and personal items,

994
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:52,562
so consider yourself duly warned.
And if you know what's good for you,

995
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,902
make sure you and your Maytag
boyfriend evacuate the premises.

996
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:59,535
Ten-four, roger, over and out.
That's all, folks.

997
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,259
Son of a bitch.

998
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:24,636
Candy. Candy!

999
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:29,975
Better hit the road, Jack.
Cops are on their way.

1000
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,011
- Candy.
- She don't wanna talk to you.

1001
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,509
You're gonna pay, you son of a bitch,
you are gonna pay.

1002
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,084
Fuck you, pal.

1003
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,118
She's gonna divorce your crazy ass

1004
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:44,451
and take every cent you got.
Every cent, pal.

1005
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:47,423
Even this house.
So you lose, buckwheat.

1006
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,585
Like hell she is, that is my house.

1007
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,595
Well, we'll see about that.

1008
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:52,892
Just wait.

1009
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,468
Just wait, you crippled Donkey Dick,
just wait.

1010
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,070
Well, why don't you wait, pal?

1011
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,730
Because I think I hear the cops
coming right now.

1012
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,320
Sure you got all the slips
for these here?

1013
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,895
Yeah, I think that's about it.

1014
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,623
I'm trying to find
Slam Webster.

1015
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,098
<i>Who? Oh, you mean Ernie Webster?</i>

1016
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:29,463
Yeah, Ernie Webster, right.

1017
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,968
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

1018
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,503
Okay.

1019
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,569
Hey, Mike, we're still shod
about, uh, ten title slips.

1020
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,803
If they're not there,
I don't know where they are.

1021
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,040
<i>He's probably at lunch.
He ought to be back in--</i>

1022
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:46,744
All right, when he gets back,
will you have him call Mike Cody?

1023
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,986
No! You get down off of there.

1024
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,556
- No!
- Get this bastard off me!

1025
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,195
- They're mine.
- Stop him!

1026
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,796
What the hell is going on?

1027
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,056
Stop it, Cowboy.

1028
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,032
Did you hear me?
Cut it out, you cut it out.

1029
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,000
You hear me?

1030
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,536
They're my cars.

1031
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,303
You say you're sorry.

1032
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,341
They're taking my cars.

1033
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:13,036
No, sir, they are not your cars
and they never have been.

1034
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,978
You're in deep shit, mister,
you better say you're sorry.

1035
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:18,118
No!

1036
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,719
No!

1037
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,286
Cowboy.

1038
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,218
- Leave him be.
- Cowboy.

1039
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,719
I forgot to tell him I sold the cars.

1040
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,389
I didn't think to tell him myself.

1041
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:37,096
Well, he'll work it out on his own.

1042
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,336
Hey, I'm sorry. You okay?

1043
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,808
Yeah, I'm all right.

1044
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:52,915
Hey, don't you think it's about time
we open up this clip joint for business?

1045
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,090
<i>Well, howdy-do folks
and welcome to Cody's Speedrome,</i>

1046
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,692
<i>home of the Demolition Derby.</i>

1047
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,055
<i>Remember, you've still got
a few minutes to crawl over</i>

1048
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,494
<i>to Big Benny's Ptomaine Pit, home
of the famous dysentery fondue.</i>

1049
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,258
<i>Our special
is Polynesian muskrat</i>

1050
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,458
<i>with dirty white sauce.</i>

1051
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,070
<i>Try it with a side
of deep fat-fried retreads.</i>

1052
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,261
I'll be right there.

1053
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,704
<i>But seriously, folks, Big Benny
has an excellent selection</i>

1054
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:20,108
<i>of fine food, some like,
corn dogs, hamburgers,</i>

1055
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:25,810
<i>hot popcorn, ice-cold beer
and ice-cold light beer.</i>

1056
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,580
<i>Potato chips, hot barbecue.</i>

1057
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,917
You know, if you still wanna go out,
I'd like to.

1058
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:37,025
I see your high school boyfriend's
running in the derby tonight.

1059
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,126
So?

1060
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:43,532
So if you wanna turn this
into kiddie-cars, that's your business.

1061
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,933
<i>We're gonna have
another smash-them-up evening</i>

1062
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,234
<i>like we do every Friday
and Saturday night.</i>

1063
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:49,842
<i>Let's get right on down to it.</i>

1064
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:53,741
<i>Would everyone please rise
for our national anthem?</i>

1065
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:07,984
Is he still mad?

1066
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,858
Look, don't worry about him, go on.

1067
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,794
Now you remember,
you break off your flag

1068
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,434
the minute you're out of the running.

1069
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,127
Because as long as it's up,
you're fair game, got it?

1070
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,327
Piece of cake.

1071
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,697
Be careful.

1072
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,930
<i>Having a little
technical difficulty here,</i>

1073
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,305
<i>but we got that an straightened out,
so let's start the countdown.</i>

1074
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:02,381
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1075
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:08,113
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

1076
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,779
<i>And here we go.</i>

1077
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,888
Holy shit.

1078
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,748
<i>Red Baron...</i>

1079
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,861
<i>Beautiful hit on...</i>

1080
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,873
<i>Beautiful. Oh, what a hit.</i>

1081
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,171
<i>We got a little bit of fire...</i>

1082
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,540
<i>Beautiful.</i>

1083
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,111
<i>Oh, counter hit.</i>

1084
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:18,719
<i>They don't want to quit it, folks.
Somebody must be a little hungry.</i>

1085
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,587
<i>Look out for...</i>

1086
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,327
<i>I think it's about time
you break out your flag.</i>

1087
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,934
Tim, Tim, break off your flag!

1088
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,071
<i>Student Driver,
please break off your flag.</i>

1089
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,340
Tim, break it off.

1090
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,535
<i>That young man
is out of commission there.</i>

1091
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,405
<i>Wait a minute, Slam.</i>

1092
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,182
<i>We got a problem here, folks.</i>

1093
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,752
<i>Break off that flag...</i>

1094
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:31,522
<i>Red lights on the field, will everyone
hold their positions please?</i>

1095
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:34,766
<i>Is he all right?</i>

1096
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,799
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, Mike.

1097
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,806
- Pearson, you all right?
- You crazy son of a bitch.

1098
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:42,832
Mike, I'm okay.

1099
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,944
You weren't trying to win,
you had it out for him.

1100
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,376
- I got the wind knocked out of me.
- What's your problem?

1101
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,015
Get off the track.

1102
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,176
- Mike, I'm okay.
- Get off the track, Slam.

1103
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:56,647
All right. All right, I'm going, screw it.

1104
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:58,814
I don't like the way the rules
keep changing anyway.

1105
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,552
<i>Well, folks, it seems to be a...</i>

1106
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:03,853
<i>Everything seems to be all right.</i>

1107
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,023
<i>We're out of danger, so we're
gonna go through a short cleanup,</i>

1108
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,896
- Come on.
<i>- so please head on over</i>

1109
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:13,369
<i>to Big Benny's Ptomaine Shack,
and try that Polynesian muskrat.</i>

1110
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,272
No. No.

1111
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,167
No.

1112
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,616
What's baby gonna do to Donny?

1113
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,411
Donny doesn't know.

1114
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:35,213
Sure you do.

1115
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,693
Call me Miss Baby Doll.

1116
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,089
Baby Doll.

1117
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,230
- I said Miss Baby Doll.
- Miss Baby Doll.

1118
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,735
That's enough,
I'll tell you when again.

1119
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:06,218
Down. Stay put.

1120
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,082
This is nice. You having fun?

1121
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,416
It's fun, huh?

1122
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,787
What's that?

1123
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,331
Sounds like it's coming
from right out front.

1124
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,867
Some kids hot-rodding around.

1125
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:27,265
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

1126
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:37,139
Oh, my God.

1127
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,479
Candy, what's going on?

1128
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:42,144
- He's crazy, he's got a bulldozer.
- Who?

1129
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,721
What? Slam?

1130
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,790
It's Slam? Call the cops.

1131
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,655
- The cops.
- Wait.

1132
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,888
Untie me, Candy.

1133
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,638
Aah! Operator?

1134
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,366
Sorry, um, give me the cops.

1135
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,273
He's got-- He's got a bulldozer.

1136
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,639
He's gonna kill us.

1137
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,680
Candy, I'm in here.

1138
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:17,049
Candy, untie me.

1139
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,866
Help me.

1140
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,933
Hey, Candy, help me!

1141
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,284
Our Father, who an in heaven...

1142
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,256
Yahoo!

1143
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:36,163
Somebody! Get me out of here!

1144
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,928
- Hey, you!
- Me?

1145
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:40,300
Yeah, you, get me out of here!

1146
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:49,272
- Okay, folks, step on back.
- Help him out.

1147
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:52,451
Okay, Slam, now shut it off.

1148
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,318
Come on, shut it off.

1149
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,987
Come down off of there now,
you've had your fun.

1150
01:21:58,146 --> 01:21:59,921
Slam, I'm warning you.

1151
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,823
Come down off there
right now, you hear me?

1152
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,840
You're under arrest.
Now get down off of there.

1153
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:20,810
Take me away, look me up,
it is a crime to feel this good.

1154
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,116
Yeah!

1155
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,412
That's right.

1156
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,085
Still going to Chicago tomorrow?

1157
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,990
I got my ticket.

1158
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,233
You love him, don't you?

1159
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,397
He's crazy.

1160
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,877
- You speeding?
- No.

1161
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:37,447
Oh, no.

1162
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,963
- What happened?
- Jesus, I don't know, Mike.

1163
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:55,836
I was working on the books and all of
a sudden the whole place was on fire.

1164
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,476
Oh, my God.

1165
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,543
Get down!

1166
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,751
We need help here, hit that hot spot.

1167
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,895
- Mike.
- You okay, Mike?

1168
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,896
- Aw.
- Oh.

1169
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,972
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1170
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,813
Hang on.

1171
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:30,665
Okay, everybody, coffee's on.

1172
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,934
Do you want some coffee?

1173
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,670
I'll get it.

1174
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,690
Got to check over here.

1175
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,658
How could you do this?

1176
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,372
Tim.

1177
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:15,348
Mike, believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.

1178
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,107
God, I'm sorry
any of this ever happened.

1179
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,283
Mike.

1180
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,013
Hey, Mike, come here,
we got something to show you.

1181
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,057
Damn valve is wide open.

1182
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,104
It was padlocked.

1183
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,411
Who else got a key to this look?

1184
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:53,815
Cowboy.

1185
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,656
Better get something.

1186
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,954
Cowboy?

1187
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:06,594
Why?

1188
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:10,158
They took my cars away.

1189
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,518
Cow, this was our home.

1190
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,537
Dad.

1191
01:27:53,034 --> 01:27:54,377
Dad, I'm sorry.

1192
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:59,845
You want a ride back to town?

1193
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:48,392
What happened to you?

1194
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,768
Speedrome burnt down last night.

1195
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,204
No.

1196
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:02,243
To the ground.

1197
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,376
What are you gonna do?

1198
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,226
- It all depends.
- On what?

1199
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:20,925
On you.

1200
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,106
Damn, I love you.

1201
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,242
Well, in that case,
I better let you out of here.

1202
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,405
Ha. What?

1203
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,085
<i> Come on, boys,
old drives keep moving.</i>

1204
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,121
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

1205
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,350
Listen, I make halfway decent
money and if we saved,

1206
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,927
we could rebuild
the Speedrome better than ever.

1207
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,529
- I'm gonna sell it.
- Why?

1208
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,028
To Roger Pearson.

1209
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,861
I think he's ready
to make me a fair deal now.

1210
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,230
Get us off to a good start

1211
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:34,032
I know how to get us off
to a good start.

1212
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:43,080
- I gotta ask you something.
- What?

1213
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:44,648
Tell you on the way there.

1214
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,217
- On the way where?
- Come on.

1215
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,751
- Wait up.
- Okay, Mom.

1216
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:51,049
- Take good care of yourself, eat well.
- I will.

1217
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:53,351
Not too much junk food.

1218
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,684
Hey, you're gonna miss
the parade, man.

1219
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,124
I guess so.

1220
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:01,229
- See you, Bonnie.
- Bye, Tim.

1221
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:02,792
I'd give you a kiss goodbye

1222
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,994
but I don't wanna give you
my spinal meningitis.

1223
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:07,139
Get out of here. Ha, ha.

1224
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,919
I'll call you from Chicago.

1225
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,489
Hey, you call collect.

1226
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,557
Okay, Dad.

1227
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,559
- We love you.
- I don't. Ow.

1228
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,756
Boy, am I gonna miss you.

1229
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,749
Yo, hey.

1230
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,583
Stop.

1231
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:00,385
- Yo.
- No, don't stop.

1232
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,357
Hey, Yo.

1233
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,295
No, no, keep going, keep going.

1234
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,314
Open up.

1235
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,543
What did you do,
fall out of your seat?

1236
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,742
Come on.

1237
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,786
- Just a minute, Slam.
- Come on.

1238
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:31,890
- I didn't mean--
- Just move it.

1239
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:33,423
Slam, I just--

1240
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,420
Happy trails, partner.

1241
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:39,655
You're going the wrong direction, kid.
Come here.

1242
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:41,462
- What's this?
- Money.

1243
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:42,657
For what?

1244
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,769
For that dolphin cruise in Florida.

1245
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:47,973
Turn around.

1246
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,938
Put this in the mail and the car's yours.

1247
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,944
Here.

1248
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:57,749
Get going, you have along drive.

1249
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:04,515
- I'm gonna pay you back.
- We're even, kid.

1250
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,420
Thanks, Slam.

1251
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:12,987
Forget it. Besides, reverse gear's shot,
the damn thing only moves forward.

1252
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:18,936
- Can I drop you guys off?
- Nope, we're going to the parade.

1253
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,176
- See you.
- Drop us a card.
