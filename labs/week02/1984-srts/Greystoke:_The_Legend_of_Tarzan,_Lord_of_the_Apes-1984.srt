1
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,075
Hey!

2
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:11,000
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Come along!

3
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,085
Come on, let them go.

4
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,338
Come on.

5
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,220
Hey, go on.

6
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,437
Hey, come along.

7
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,440
Come on, Toby. That's it.

8
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,167
Don't look too bad, do it?

9
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,587
Father, I've decided to go.

10
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,714
I was afraid of that.

11
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,842
- And Alice?
- She's determined to come.

12
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,762
No place for her.

13
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,755
Thank you, Angus.

14
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,678
Here we are.

15
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,934
- Damn the boy.
- He lost the race.

16
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,532
Don't fret over her. She's strong
enough to withstand a year in the tropics.

17
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,577
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

18
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,083
Forgive me if I don't come
and see you off.

19
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,547
I'd make a fool of myself down there.

20
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,385
Well, I've written
a few letters for you.

21
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,348
Might... Might be helpful on your way.

22
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,310
There's one to Uncle Bill here.

23
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,323
See here, Father...

24
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,409
we'll be all right, I promise.

25
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,787
Give me your hand.

26
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:59,752
Of course you will.

27
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,933
Hello, Jane.

28
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,103
I found something for you in London.

29
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,231
- A little scarab ring.
- Thank you.

30
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,404
- Darling, we'll be late.
- Yes.

31
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,031
Does that mean we'll marry, Uncle Jack?

32
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,033
No, it doesn't. I'm already married.

33
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,995
But we won't just give you to some
Tom, Dick or Harry from Baltimore.

34
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,457
We shall find someone suitable,
preferably an Englishman.

35
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,461
There you are, nanny.

36
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,298
Thank you. Goodbye.

37
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,141
Take care of him.

38
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,560
- Safe journey.
- Thank you.

39
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,187
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

40
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,814
Goodbye.

41
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,693
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my lord.

42
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,441
Jack?

43
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:28,943
Jack?

44
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,370
Jack!

45
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,717
Where's Jack?

46
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,931
He was alive last night.
Where is he?

47
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,477
It's not my fault.

48
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,189
Where is Lord Clayton?

49
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,149
It's not my fault.

50
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,821
They'll blame me,
but it's not my fault.

51
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,326
It's not my fault.

52
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,623
Jack.

53
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,209
Jack!

54
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,297
- Oh, Jack.
- It's all right.

55
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,467
All right, all right.
It's all right, darling.

56
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,220
I was so frightened.
I thought you drowned.

57
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,598
It's all right.

58
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,228
I was trying to help him. It's too late.

59
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,151
- Poor boy.
- Come on. Come on.

60
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,518
December the 17th, 1885.

61
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,104
It is almost 10 months
since the shipwreck...

62
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,316
and Captain Billings left us
to find help.

63
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,444
As each week passes,
I have to face up to the fact...

64
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,947
that the poor man must have
perished in the attempt.

65
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,247
The apes have returned
in greater numbers this time.

66
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:52,127
They eat everything in the vicinity,
so food will be hard to find.

67
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,339
But at least they leave us alone.

68
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,699
The difficult birth of our son,
followed by a bout of malaria...

69
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,910
has weakened my darling Alice terribly.

70
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,206
While the baby howls at the world
and every day grows stronger...

71
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,710
she shows little sign of recovery.

72
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:38,382
The fever has robbed her of her milk
and clouded her perception.

73
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,219
She still believes that we are
safely home in Scotland.

74
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:48,726
In a way, I'm grateful, as this delusion
spares her the reality of our predicament.

75
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,147
There, there.

76
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,237
Alice?

77
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,079
Alice.

78
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,915
Oh, no.

79
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:23,678
Alice.

80
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,479
We have been traveling these
dank rivers of West Africa for months...

81
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,816
amassing an inventory of fauna
for the British Museum.

82
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:10,071
I am the only Belgian among the English,
pressed on them by my superiors...

83
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,739
to guide them and watch them.

84
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,453
Got him.

85
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,457
- What is it?
- Don't know.

86
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,377
But it might have been something.

87
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,797
Yes, major...

88
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,675
but now it is a dead something.

89
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,843
Of course it is.

90
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,778
Heavens.

91
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,671
What are they saying, D'Arnot?

92
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,174
Dinner est servi.

93
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:18,848
No. Arrived. "Dinner has arrived"
is a slightly better translation.

94
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,059
I don't think that's
frightfully funny, D'Arnot.

95
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,438
My companions consider themselves...

96
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,107
to be the foremost
among God's creatures...

97
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,903
and treat Africa and all things African
with an unwavering contempt.

98
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,488
If I wasn't under orders...

99
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,159
I'd have abandoned them at week one
and returned to Brussels.

100
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,704
You drop that box again
and I'll shoot you.

101
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,548
Come on! Apes! Belcher!

102
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,303
- Come on!
- I thought I said there was to be no...

103
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,057
Well, at least try not
to damage the skins!

104
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,226
Major!

105
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,103
Damn them.

106
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,031
Major Downing!

107
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,427
There, Major Jack.
They're going into the trees!

108
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,098
Come on. Come on. They're beauties.

109
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,933
Downing!

110
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,538
Be quick or we'll lose it.

111
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
Downing!

112
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,209
Fire one more shot, you butcher,
and I'll shoot you.

113
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,757
Steady, old chap.
It's all in a day's sport.

114
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,181
Sport and blood, Sir Evelyn.

115
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,935
Stuff of life.

116
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,117
Good God.

117
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,767
"John..."

118
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,395
"...Clayton."

119
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,525
John Clayton.
It's the Earl of Greystoke's son.

120
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,616
Good God.

121
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,539
So this is what became of him.

122
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,804
- Those blasted drums, Belcher.
- Yes, Major Jack.

123
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:32,393
- Have you got a finger in the bullet hole?
- Yes, major.

124
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,481
Major Jack.

125
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,869
Pygmies!

126
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,730
Back. Back to the boat!

127
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,750
Sir Evelyn!

128
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,379
Where are you?

129
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,330
Aide-moi, papa.

130
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,295
Papa.

131
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,602
Qui êtes-vous?

132
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,273
Who are...

133
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,985
Who are you?

134
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,573
Sir, help me.

135
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:42,077
Say something.

136
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,813
Mon Dieu!

137
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,087
Pourquoi...

138
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,703
Back!

139
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,694
Pas possible.

140
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,672
- Incroyable.
- Croy.

141
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,057
- Oui!
- Oui!

142
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:17,665
Razor. Razor.

143
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,543
Razor.

144
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:26,049
Razor! Razor!

145
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,932
Razor.

146
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,567
Raz...

147
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,906
Razor.

148
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,494
Ra...

149
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,707
Raz...

150
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,877
Razo...

151
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,090
Raz...

152
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,553
Razor.

153
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,308
- Razor.
- Razor.

154
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,227
Razor.

155
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,772
Yes.

156
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:13,156
- Razor, razor.
- No.

157
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,286
- No. No, no razor.
- Ra...

158
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,165
Mirror. Mirror.

159
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,213
Mi. Mi.

160
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:33,885
- Mirror, mirror.
- Mirror. Mirror.

161
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,637
Mirror. Mirror.

162
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,184
Yes. Mirror.

163
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,567
- Mirror.
- Mirror.

164
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:55,573
John is a mimic of uncanny ability.

165
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,074
Yes.

166
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:01,621
Words became like magic tricks to him.

167
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:08,127
And in six months, he has managed
to grasp the rudiments of the language.

168
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,672
But now I have to convince him
of who he is.

169
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,218
Indeed, what he is!

170
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:18,721
Mirror. Razor, razor. Mirror.

171
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:21,057
No. No, no, no.

172
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,394
Man. Man.

173
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,230
Dieu!

174
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:35,940
Animal. Animal.

175
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:44,830
- Animal! Animal!
- No, no, no. Animal. Animal. Animal.

176
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,875
- Animal. Animal.
- Animal.

177
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,920
Animal. Animal. Animal.

178
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,548
Animal!

179
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,592
Phillippe.

180
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,721
Phillippe D'Arnot.

181
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,561
John.

182
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,938
Clayton.

183
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,534
Your home.

184
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,038
Greystoke.

185
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,293
Mother. Father.

186
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,879
Father. Mother.

187
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:38,467
Family. Yes, family. Not:

188
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:44,473
That is your mother.
That is your father, I tell you.

189
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:50,104
Family, John. Mother, father.
Mother, father.

190
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,440
Family!

191
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,035
Listen to me, John.

192
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,122
How many other white apes
have you seen?

193
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,375
You're like me, not them.

194
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:18,007
You have another family, far away.

195
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,803
One you have never seen. Like me.

196
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,141
Soon I must go to my family.

197
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,518
Why?

198
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,688
Dead.

199
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,316
Who is dead?

200
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:37,985
Dead.

201
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:41,197
Dead like mine. Yours dead.

202
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,034
Why do you say that?

203
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:51,916
If not dead, why you here?

204
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,377
Because I'm lost.

205
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,923
And I'm looking for her.

206
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,555
And my mother looks for me.

207
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:13,396
His mind was able to grasp
the concept of past and present.

208
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:17,233
But he desperately resisted the notion
that his mother...

209
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,985
might have been anything other
than an ape.

210
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,655
No. No, no.

211
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,574
No!

212
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,921
As for the future...

213
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,717
it was something that
simply did not exist for him.

214
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,928
And I could never
make him understand...

215
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:50,975
that I had another life waiting for me
in another world...

216
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,686
and another time.

217
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,085
John. Mother. Father.

218
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,672
Father. Mother.

219
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,676
Family, John. How many other
white apes have you seen?

220
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:31,056
You are like me, not them.
Like me, like me. Not them.

221
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:35,144
- Father. Father.
- No.

222
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:40,983
Mother, mother.
Family. Yes, family.

223
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:46,030
That is your mother.
That is your father, I tell you.

224
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,076
Family, John. Mother. Father.
Mother. Father.

225
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,790
Family, family.
Father, mother. Mother, father.

226
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,667
Family. Family. Family.

227
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,115
Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog. Dog.

228
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,777
Animal. Animal.

229
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:17,681
Six taps this time?

230
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,683
But nine the next.

231
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:25,814
- So don't do it again?
- No, sir.

232
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,837
Boy, please.

233
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,549
May I have some water, please?

234
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,347
Thank you.

235
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:03,519
Put something on, old boy.

236
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,522
One of the rules.

237
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:11,360
Got to keep a sense of decorum.
Otherwise we'll all end up like savages.

238
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,487
Well...

239
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,159
Thank you, sir.

240
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,704
John.

241
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,772
I'm Buller, the proprietor.

242
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:55,571
Capitaine Phillippe D'Arnot.

243
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,072
Belgian.

244
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,751
John.

245
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:14,089
My friend is also Belgian,
but he has no English.

246
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,968
Presumably...

247
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,389
- you want a room?
- Yes, please, sir.

248
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,725
You fellows here for long?

249
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,228
Well...

250
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:39,990
Thank you, sir.

251
01:08:56,508 --> 01:09:00,844
This is not the world, John,
just the edge of it.

252
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,807
- Convicts?
- I don't think so.

253
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:08,352
- I would bet on it.
- Animals, more like.

254
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,522
Very nasty monkeys, old boy.

255
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,198
You see, John...

256
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:26,495
we haven't changed places. This...

257
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,667
Look.

258
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,765
Fire, John. Fire.

259
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,608
Come and sit down, capitaine.

260
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,864
That's a nine, you miss a go.

261
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,709
Capitaine.

262
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,044
Captain Billings you have met, yes?

263
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,964
He's been here longer than any of us.

264
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,260
Now the rest of the gentlemen.
We have Jeff son Brown.

265
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,679
Olivestone.

266
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:28,765
Stimson.

267
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,976
Chalky White.

268
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:34,021
And that's Mrs. White on his shoulder.

269
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,649
I hear you've lost all your belongings.

270
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,359
Yes.

271
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,570
Where did that happen?

272
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,488
In the north.

273
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,616
Come now, Mr. D'Arnot.

274
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,202
Where are you really from?

275
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,997
I was a member
of a zoological expedition...

276
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:55,167
funded by the British Museum.

277
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,878
Several months ago we were attacked.

278
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,590
I urgently need to return to Europe...

279
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,802
but unfortunately I have no funds.

280
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,433
However, I can leave you
a promissory note.

281
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:17,731
Well, the last frog we had through here
couldn't pay his bills either.

282
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:22,945
We turned him over to French authorities,
who were jolly pleased to have him back.

283
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,614
Turned out to be a convict.

284
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,832
I can assure you, sir...

285
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,752
that I am no criminal.

286
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,297
Then what are you?

287
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,592
I'm an explorer.

288
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,303
What a liar.

289
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,311
I think that deserves
a thrashing, don't you?

290
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,147
Six.

291
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,695
John! John!

292
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:23,672
Fire. Fire. Fire!

293
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:02,878
I sense that we have a long
and difficult journey ahead of us.

294
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:08,050
Perhaps weeks of waiting for a ship
that will give us passage to England.

295
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,428
I will try to teach John
some rudimentary manners...

296
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,473
and a greater understanding
of the language.

297
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:20,062
Like a father, I am resolved
to impart to him all that I can.

298
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,441
But never, not even for a moment,
do I doubt that to take him back...

299
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,943
is a perilous undertaking.

300
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,781
For John...

301
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,241
but also for his family.

302
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:37,204
Apes, did you say?

303
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,706
Apes?

304
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,585
I can't believe it.

305
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,425
The coffee, Sir Evelyn, the coffee.

306
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:54,596
It's an extraordinary example
of man's superiority over beast.

307
01:13:54,806 --> 01:14:00,102
Not only did he survive, he made himself
their master. Their lord, as it were.

308
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,437
Is he...? Is he sound?

309
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,357
Is he...? Is he normal?

310
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,443
Well, I'm told he's a remarkable...

311
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,948
young man.

312
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:16,952
But apes.

313
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,626
Welcome home, my lord.

314
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,838
- This fellow D'Arnot...
- D'Arnot.

315
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,299
D'Arnot. Deserves recognition.

316
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,844
Do you suppose
we could get him a medal...

317
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,221
from the Royal Geographical Society?

318
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:40,517
Do you think he'd appreciate that?
All right, all right. I can manage.

319
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,728
I don't wish to belittle
D'Arnot's contribution...

320
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,440
but he was merely a part
of an expedition.

321
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,192
A British expedition.

322
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:53,488
Laurels for this extraordinary achievement
belong to the expedition itself...

323
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,198
not the individual.

324
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,829
In any case, although the circumstances
indicate that he is your grandson...

325
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,789
we can't prove it.

326
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,794
Of course, we might be able to do so
if we were able to make tests.

327
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,671
He's here.

328
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:15,302
If he's a Greystoke,
I'll know him at a glance.

329
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,216
Johnny?

330
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,885
Is that you?

331
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,055
Come out and show yourself.

332
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,955
Oh, my boy.

333
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:31,419
My dear, dear boy.

334
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:45,267
Sir, I thank you with all my heart.

335
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,795
Come.

336
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,884
Welcome, welcome.

337
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,014
Hasn't changed a jot, has it?

338
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,976
Well, come on up.

339
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,270
We'll take you to your room.

340
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,403
- I wonder if you'll find it cold up there.
- D'Arnot.

341
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,114
Sir Evelyn. Excuse me.

342
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,325
We must talk.

343
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,122
Do you recognize her?

344
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,666
How could he recognize me, uncle?

345
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,543
We've never met.

346
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,670
Welcome home, Lord Clayton.

347
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,507
Of course, of course.
I keep thinking he's my son.

348
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,177
This is Jane, from America.

349
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,014
My ward. I'm looking after her.

350
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,979
Your father gave me this.

351
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,232
Elle est jolie.

352
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,860
She's pretty.

353
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,695
Yes, she is.

354
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,697
This is Monsieur D'Arnot.

355
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,992
Monsieur D'Arnot, it's a great day for us.

356
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:29,037
Sir Evelyn told us all you've done
for Lord Clayton.

357
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,831
No more than he has done for me.

358
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,379
You must be tired after your journey.

359
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,839
- Well...
- Well, come on, Johnny.

360
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,884
We'll show you to your room.

361
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,346
Look out for these stairs.

362
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,556
They're slippery.

363
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:55,897
When I was a child, I'd slide down here
on a tray from the nursery.

364
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,865
Come on, Johnny.

365
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,620
Come on this way.

366
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,998
This was your father's room.

367
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,085
That's your father.

368
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:19,879
Fine soldier.

369
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,090
That's your mother.

370
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,302
Pretty girl.

371
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,781
Can...? Can he read English?

372
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,658
Oh, yes, sir, a little.

373
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,827
"John Clayton."

374
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:54,080
Junior house, Eton.

375
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,541
For the long jump.

376
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,210
"1870."

377
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,713
The long jump.

378
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:05,049
The mighty leap.

379
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,801
Damn silly, really.

380
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:13,266
I can't say what it means to me...

381
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,685
to have you with me.

382
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,564
Well...

383
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,651
Till dinner, then.

384
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,737
Yes.

385
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,031
Thank you, sir.

386
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,684
- Good evening, Lord Esker.
- Evening, Dean.

387
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,353
Hello.

388
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:04,776
- You look absolutely gorgeous.
- Thank you, Charles.

389
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,364
- She's rather smart, isn't she?
- She's beautiful.

390
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,324
Austin. The eight cylinder.

391
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,370
Do you know Johnny's here?

392
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,546
John. John.

393
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:34,013
Oh, quite right, quite right.
I hate spoons.

394
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,312
Bravo.

395
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,523
Well done, your lordship.

396
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,276
Welcome home, Johnny.

397
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:51,364
Can't help saying it over and over.
Welcome home, Johnny.

398
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,825
- Welcome home.
- To Johnny.

399
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,163
We are already at a disadvantage...

400
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:02,584
because it's several months
since he left the wild.

401
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:06,421
My colleagues and I wish to examine him
at the earliest opportunity.

402
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,131
Science demands it.

403
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,802
I think you will find, Sir Evelyn,
that Lord Clayton has a mind of his own.

404
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:15,263
- Of course.
- Then you should ask him.

405
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,266
I shouldn't let the scientists
poke you about.

406
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:21,769
Best plan would be to get him to school.
Eton for a year or two.

407
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,606
I think he's been away long enough.
Don't you?

408
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,650
Yes. I have.

409
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,195
Did you know, sir,
that they have these little men, Pygmies?

410
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,281
Pigs, did you say?

411
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:44,334
It's high.
Been left to hang a couple of weeks.

412
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,837
It's a bit of an acquired taste, really.
But do try some.

413
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:49,714
Close to rotten, really.

414
01:22:49,924 --> 01:22:52,884
You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

415
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,057
Ça sent...
Ça sent pas très bon.

416
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:02,936
- English.
- No, thank you.

417
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:07,315
- Won't be long before you talk like us.
- I hope not.

418
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:11,653
I think English is so much prettier when
spoken with a French accent, don't you?

419
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:13,696
Oh, nonsense.

420
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,868
"Won't be long
before you're talking like the rest of us."

421
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:25,458
"It's a bit of an acquired taste, really.
But do try some."

422
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,337
- That's quite remarkable.
- It could be you, Esker.

423
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,340
That was marvelous, John.
That was perfect.

424
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:38,304
John is an excellent mimic. Any animal
that he has heard, parfaitement.

425
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,849
How wonderful.
What animals can you do?

426
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,186
Please, can I hear one?

427
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:57,865
This is a game that
we used to play on board the ship.

428
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,493
He used to enchant the crew.

429
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:05,456
The best thing is if you close your eyes
and imagine that you are en Afrique.

430
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,709
Yes. In Africa.

431
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,303
It's beautiful.

432
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,723
Do another one.

433
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,933
Close your eyes.

434
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,911
John!

435
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,040
Very realistic.

436
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,630
I hope you'll come see us...

437
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,259
at the earliest opportunity,
Monsieur D'Arnot.

438
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:01,763
Of course I will, sir.
Thank you very much.

439
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,019
Jane, Jane. Goodbye.

440
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,107
- Look after him, yes?
- I will, Phillippe.

441
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,946
I will be back, John, I promise.

442
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,949
And by then you will have forgotten
all your French.

443
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,701
No.

444
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,460
Au revoir.

445
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:47,475
Razor.

446
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,107
Mirror.

447
01:25:59,113 --> 01:26:00,738
Au revoir.

448
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,211
Good rule to follow, John:

449
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,172
Never shed a tear in public.

450
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,675
Charles, sometimes you're so cruel.

451
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:22,552
Am I right?

452
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:31,811
He's a good runner, isn't he?

453
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,439
Phillippe! Phillippe!

454
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,283
Kidneys.

455
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,412
Hope you won't be leaving us now,
my dear.

456
01:28:54,621 --> 01:29:00,209
That fat aunt of yours in Baltimore
is missing you, I understand.

457
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,295
- Kedgeree.
- No, uncle.

458
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,463
I'd rather stay here for the winter.

459
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,507
Try to teach Johnny some more.

460
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:09,302
Good girl.

461
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,555
What do you think of that, Johnny?

462
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,849
I think it's very good.

463
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,893
Tomatoes.

464
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:27,111
Oh, kippers too, yes.

465
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,997
Porridge with everything.

466
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,124
I'll have some myself.

467
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:49,925
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

468
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,767
One, two, three.

469
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,727
Oh, John.

470
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,732
- Charles.
- Charles.

471
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,360
Good afternoon.

472
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,738
- Dancing class?
- Yes. He's a wonderful dancer.

473
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,240
Good.

474
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:16,535
Amavero.

475
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,412
Johnny.

476
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,207
- Amavero.
- Amavero.

477
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,504
- Amaveris.
- Amaveris.

478
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,297
- Amaverit.
- Verit.

479
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,176
Amavero. "I shall have loved."

480
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,221
Amaveris.

481
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,848
"Thou wilt have loved."

482
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:39,892
Amaverit.

483
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:42,686
"He will have loved."

484
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,908
Did you catch it?

485
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,163
Let it go.

486
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:28,023
Just look there. Look.

487
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,156
Johnny?

488
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,172
Johnny.

489
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,020
What's that?

490
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,233
What?

491
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:17,239
Infernal machine!

492
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,535
Charles.

493
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:27,208
- I didn't expect to see you today.
- Jane.

494
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:29,877
- Good hunting?
- Wonderful.

495
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:37,426
I came because I have something
rather important to discuss with you.

496
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,598
I noticed, as did my uncle,
who remarked on it...

497
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:47,895
that Clayton's become attached to you,
in a somewhat puppy-ish sort of way.

498
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:52,525
I think that's understandable.
He's alone, a little lost.

499
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,277
Of course.

500
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:58,906
But I could not help notice that
you appear to be fond of him.

501
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,616
I am, Charles.

502
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:02,451
I am fond of him.

503
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:04,119
But no more than that?

504
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,372
- No more than fond?
- No.

505
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,624
Why would you ask?

506
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:12,628
I hope he's not become
too dependent on you.

507
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,756
Especially in view of
what I'm about to say.

508
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:17,508
Yes?

509
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:21,262
We've spent enough time together
to know that we're well-suited.

510
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,347
I've become very attached to you.

511
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,768
I want your permission to ask
Lord Greystoke for your hand.

512
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,854
Jane...

513
01:33:31,565 --> 01:33:32,773
will you marry me?

514
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:41,282
Thank you, Dean.
I can manage that.

515
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:43,659
As you wish, ma'am.

516
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,132
This is most unexpected, Charles.

517
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:00,426
But my answer is no.

518
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,595
Absolutely no.

519
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,139
No?

520
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:10,519
Three months ago, before Clayton
returned, I doubt you'd have hesitated.

521
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,730
- That is not true.
- I think it is.

522
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,690
It has nothing to do with John.

523
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:19,153
I'm not in love with you, Charles.
That is all.

524
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,622
I'm sorry, Charles.

525
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:39,400
You've got a lot to learn, jungle man.

526
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:10,431
Hey, hey.

527
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,099
Come on, Willy.

528
01:36:14,394 --> 01:36:16,603
You're doing fine.

529
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,943
Hello, hello, my corky.

530
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:25,738
Hello, hello, below.

531
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:30,159
When I've got one fish,
I'd like another, you know.

532
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,371
I like fishing, Grandpa.

533
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,206
I like fishing.

534
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:39,668
He's an old bugger down there.

535
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:41,962
I'll never get him up.

536
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:08,655
Come on, now, and have a look
at the wall.

537
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:19,958
Watch those horses, Willy.

538
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:24,004
He's a bit soft in the head.

539
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,349
It goes all around the estate.

540
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,102
Keep them out.

541
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:42,397
And keep us in.

542
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,860
This is yours, Johnny. This estate.

543
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:51,615
I've seen other fellows sell off
bits of theirs.

544
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:54,159
A little here, a little there.

545
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:57,287
That's the rot, Johnny.

546
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:02,292
Selling little bits,
chipping away at the edges.

547
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:06,046
In the end, they have nothing.

548
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:11,218
Never sell. Never, ever sell.

549
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:14,513
Do anything to keep it whole.

550
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,348
You understand me?

551
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:19,434
Yourself whole.

552
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:25,274
Land is the lifeblood of this family.

553
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,665
Yes, sir.

554
01:38:43,877 --> 01:38:45,252
Sir.

555
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:48,255
Just step this way, please.

556
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,260
Good evening. Merry Christmas.

557
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,096
Merry Christmas.

558
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:58,640
- Hello.
- How do you do?

559
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,809
Very well, thank you.

560
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:09,568
Dean, I think everyone's here now.
Don't you think so?

561
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,695
Let us hope, sir.

562
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:17,910
How do you do?
How do you do? Thank you.

563
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,414
I'm starving.

564
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,169
- Have you ever had a mince pie?
- No.

565
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,629
Wonderful.

566
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,797
You look beautiful tonight.

567
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,513
Whereas, as you all know...

568
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:43,602
this is my favorite gathering
of the year.

569
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:46,313
Christmas Eve.

570
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:50,651
Very often on these occasions
I've very little to say.

571
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,529
But this year is a very special year.

572
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:59,493
This year my son has returned
from Africa...

573
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:03,622
after many, many years.

574
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,668
Some people might say
that an old man...

575
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:11,171
shouldn't expect any further blessing.

576
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,465
And I daresay they might be quite right.

577
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:16,009
But I hope for still more.

578
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:20,806
One day, I hope to announce
his betrothal.

579
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:26,019
And following that, his heir.

580
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:34,528
Thank you, that's good.

581
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,161
Well...

582
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,164
To all of you.

583
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:32,085
There's my boy. Jolly good.

584
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:04,636
Nursery days, nursery days.

585
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,990
Back in the nursery.
A lovely slide.

586
01:43:27,577 --> 01:43:28,994
Here we go.

587
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:31,496
Bumpity, bumpity, bump, bump, bump.

588
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,853
Somebody must have been taken ill.

589
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:19,211
Johnny.

590
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:24,049
Let me stay still.

591
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,802
Now...

592
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:31,264
all I can taste is blood.

593
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:36,519
You know, I didn't like it
when you went off.

594
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,814
I'm so glad you came back.

595
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:46,029
I think I...
I think I might be going...

596
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:49,032
off myself somewhere.

597
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:58,284
One of these days.

598
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:51,905
Jane!

599
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:21,268
Jane!

600
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:51,631
Jane. Jane.

601
01:47:57,596 --> 01:48:00,557
Please, Johnny, don't be sad.

602
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,688
I love you, Johnny.

603
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,149
I love you.

604
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:00,617
Phillippe.

605
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:02,994
Jane.

606
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:12,587
I have missed you, both of you,
so very much.

607
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:18,885
- How are you?
- As you see.

608
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,263
How is he?

609
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:26,100
Judge for yourself, Phillippe.

610
01:49:29,855 --> 01:49:32,398
He'll be so pleased to see you.

611
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:41,658
Phillippe.

612
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:44,244
We've missed you too.

613
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:54,546
John?

614
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,193
Comment vas-tu?

615
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,619
John?

616
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,457
I am alone, Phillippe.

617
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:35,128
You brought me here
to look for my family.

618
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:37,463
I found an old man.

619
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:39,007
Now he's dead.

620
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:41,801
This isn't my home.

621
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:47,140
- This isn't my home.
- It could be, John.

622
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,811
You are a human being, a man.

623
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:54,814
You must come to terms
with that fact.

624
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,025
That reality.

625
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,819
You will never find a home,
be at home...

626
01:51:00,029 --> 01:51:03,072
here or in the jungle,
until you do.

627
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:07,952
You must overcome
what has happened to you.

628
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:11,164
You must transcend
the loss, the pain...

629
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:14,667
and create something new.

630
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,089
John.

631
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,843
Don't give in so soon.

632
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:38,232
Otherwise, all that
you have achieved...

633
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:41,486
all our work, will be in vain.

634
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:46,032
- Of course I will stay and help you...
- As my keeper.

635
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:50,495
- You don't need a keeper, John.
- No, I don't.

636
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:16,396
Never sell.

637
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:19,524
Never, ever sell.

638
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,611
Do anything, but keep it whole.

639
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,030
Understand me?

640
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:29,784
Yourself whole.

641
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:42,839
Please, Johnny, don't be sad.

642
01:52:45,676 --> 01:52:48,302
I love you, Johnny.

643
01:52:49,138 --> 01:52:51,264
I love you.

644
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:42,690
Leave us now, Iris, please.

645
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:46,110
Johnny.

646
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:49,632
Oh, Johnny.

647
01:56:04,249 --> 01:56:05,958
Thank you so much for coming.

648
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:10,379
May I take this opportunity
to congratulate you on your engagement.

649
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:12,715
- May you both be very happy.
- Thank you.

650
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:14,467
Monsieur D'Arnot.

651
01:56:16,511 --> 01:56:18,971
The erection of a new wing...

652
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:21,474
to Waterhouse's
magnificent building...

653
01:56:21,683 --> 01:56:25,811
allows us to house a wider
selection of specimens...

654
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,688
many of which were collected...

655
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:31,984
during my recent, ill-fated expedition
to West Africa.

656
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:37,073
An enterprise wholly
in the spirit of Charles Darwin...

657
01:56:37,282 --> 01:56:42,495
helping us to understand
the origin of our species.

658
01:56:42,955 --> 01:56:47,500
To complete these works in a style
worthy of this great museum...

659
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:52,463
has been a costly undertaking and one
we could never have contemplated...

660
01:56:52,673 --> 01:56:57,677
without the generous patronage
of the late Lord Greystoke.

661
01:56:57,970 --> 01:57:01,639
It is with great pleasure
that I call upon his grandson...

662
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:07,061
the present earl, to declare
the Greystoke Gallery open.

663
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:09,355
Would you care to cut the tape?

664
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:22,159
We'll go past to the left
of these central cases.

665
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:29,250
You may recognize one of
the specimens from Africa.

666
01:57:31,253 --> 01:57:35,089
The great hawks.
I was just explaining...

667
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:38,426
the ornithological cage here.

668
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:41,137
It's a little macabre.

669
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:44,724
It's principally bones and beaks.

670
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:47,518
With the magnifying glass,
you can actually see...

671
01:57:47,728 --> 01:57:50,062
the projection on the end
of the bird's beak...

672
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,148
with which he breaks out of the egg.

673
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:55,735
The odd thing is the various...

674
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:47,328
Our pièce de résistance.

675
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:50,748
This is actually the largest
single collection of...

676
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:54,460
Miss Porter, this is one of
the largest single collections...

677
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:57,088
of hummingbirds in Europe.

678
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:54,265
Look at the one with
the blue breast on the branch...

679
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:55,933
Excuse me.

680
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:58,978
Sir Evelyn, it's Lord Greystoke.

681
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,771
Excuse me.

682
02:02:00,981 --> 02:02:03,983
Jackson. Harrison.
Excuse me. Gangway!

683
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:29,967
- Harrison.
- Yes, sir.

684
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:32,845
The barracks. Troops.

685
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:40,371
John, don't do this, please.

686
02:03:59,933 --> 02:04:01,433
Guardsman.

687
02:04:17,492 --> 02:04:19,410
- Get back, everybody.
- Get back.

688
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:21,453
Back, please.

689
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:45,811
No. No.

690
02:04:47,021 --> 02:04:48,313
No.

691
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:51,233
No, no. No, no.

692
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:53,152
No.

693
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:14,882
C'était mon père!

694
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,309
He was my father!

695
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,409
However well
he may have mastered...

696
02:05:42,619 --> 02:05:47,706
the intricacies and complexities
of this absurd society...

697
02:05:48,666 --> 02:05:51,502
he is what the jungle
has made him.

698
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:55,297
That we saw yesterday. Irrefutably.

699
02:05:55,507 --> 02:05:57,424
I take a different view.

700
02:05:57,634 --> 02:06:00,052
He cannot blame society...

701
02:06:00,261 --> 02:06:03,514
for the action of an impulsive
and undisciplined keeper.

702
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:07,559
There are two reasons he should stay.
Firstly, for the sake of science.

703
02:06:07,769 --> 02:06:09,311
Science?

704
02:06:09,938 --> 02:06:12,147
Whose science?

705
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:15,901
Your science? The imperial science?

706
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:20,072
And second, because to go
would be a failure.

707
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:22,741
You are so utterly predictable.

708
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:26,495
What in his terms is
a magnificent achievement...

709
02:06:26,704 --> 02:06:29,081
you see as your failure,
so you call it his.

710
02:06:29,499 --> 02:06:31,542
How typical.

711
02:06:32,961 --> 02:06:34,795
How tragic.

712
02:06:36,714 --> 02:06:38,757
How very English.

713
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:42,970
He is the earl of Greystoke,
Monsieur D'Arnot.

714
02:06:43,179 --> 02:06:48,559
The earl has great estates,
great wealth, great power.

715
02:06:48,768 --> 02:06:53,313
Of course, I understand that to you
such considerations may seem absurd...

716
02:06:53,523 --> 02:06:57,776
but it is essential for all of us
that he take his place in society...

717
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:00,821
as his family has done
for generations.

718
02:07:01,322 --> 02:07:04,908
He must be greater than
the accident of his childhood.

719
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:09,246
And, what is more important,
he must be seen to be so.

720
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:13,000
My God.

721
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:19,548
Yes, of course he could stay here.

722
02:07:21,092 --> 02:07:25,429
But through people like you he would
become an object of derision...

723
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:28,974
speculation, experimentation.

724
02:07:29,183 --> 02:07:32,936
I promise you, Sir Evelyn Blount,
that I will do all in my power...

725
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:35,647
to protect him from this abuse.

726
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:37,941
This insult.

727
02:07:51,789 --> 02:07:53,790
Father!

728
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:55,667
Mother!

729
02:07:56,252 --> 02:08:00,005
Family, family, family!

730
02:08:00,214 --> 02:08:02,174
Mother, father!

731
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:04,468
Family!

732
02:08:09,057 --> 02:08:10,474
Father!

733
02:08:10,683 --> 02:08:12,392
Mother!

734
02:08:14,312 --> 02:08:18,106
Family!

735
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,693
Animal!

736
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:32,371
Mother, father.

737
02:08:35,249 --> 02:08:37,542
He must be allowed
to decide for himself.

738
02:08:37,752 --> 02:08:40,504
I want him to stay,
but I also want him to be happy.

739
02:08:40,713 --> 02:08:42,381
As happy as he can be.

740
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:45,592
And we want for him only
what he wants for himself.

741
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:46,802
To be whole, to be...

742
02:09:15,248 --> 02:09:16,540
I am going home.

743
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:19,751
Lord Greystoke, I realize...

744
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:32,264
That what happened
in London yesterday...

745
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:35,267
must have been
deeply distressing to you.

746
02:09:35,476 --> 02:09:38,311
But I would advise you,
in your present state...

747
02:09:38,521 --> 02:09:42,816
not to make any decision
that could affect your...

748
02:09:43,651 --> 02:09:44,985
future.

749
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:50,866
I am going home.

750
02:09:52,368 --> 02:09:55,662
- Lord Greystoke.
- I should go...

751
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:57,748
because I know now
who I am not.

752
02:09:58,249 --> 02:10:00,792
You are the earl of Greystoke!

753
02:10:19,103 --> 02:10:22,022
Half of me is the earl of Greystoke.

754
02:10:30,323 --> 02:10:32,657
The other half is wild.
