1
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,490
Say...

2
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,557
what's the directions you got
to McDermott?

3
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,689
Just go straight down here...

4
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,566
hang a left, catch highway 30,
and take it all the way out.

5
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,898
Straight on out,
and you can't miss it.

6
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,734
OK. Thanks a lot.

7
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,565
Get your ass out of here, lady!

8
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,306
You fool! imbecile!

9
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,836
And take these with you!

10
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,041
Damn it!

11
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,846
You son of a bitch!

12
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,911
I hope you run into a truck!

13
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,254
What's more,
you got lousy taste in music!

14
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,498
Are you going to be all right?

15
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,661
What do you want?

16
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,999
I saw you get thrown out
of that van.

17
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,767
You landed kind of hard.
Are you sure you're OK?

18
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,899
Rotate out of here, Jack!

19
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,604
If you say so.

20
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,393
- Hey, you-Ace.
-The name's Harkin.

21
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,406
Excuse me, Harkin.
Where are you headed?

22
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,374
West. How about you?

23
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:58,704
San Francisco.

24
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,603
- Want a ride?
-Sure.

25
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,075
Here.

26
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,312
I can handle it.

27
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,345
You ain't
some kind of a weirdo, are you?

28
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,221
I don't think so.

29
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,192
- What's your name?
-Sunny.

30
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,786
How come that guy threw you
out of there like that?

31
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,354
Well, what do you think?

32
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,024
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

33
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:25,092
I ain't going down on a guy
at sixty-five miles an hour...

34
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,229
just for a crummy ride.

35
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,314
You got something besides this?

36
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,724
I'm tired of this.

37
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,387
Oh, you don't like country?

38
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,023
Why don't you try
something different, OK?

39
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,657
Just pop it in.

40
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,398
Now, this I can handle.

41
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,210
So, why you got four pairs
of skis back there?

42
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,411
I'm skiing
the world championships...

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,817
freestyle at Squaw Valley.

44
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,721
I got one for bumps,
one for aerials.

45
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,019
The little short ones there
are for ballet...

46
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,357
and one's for just plain speed.

47
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,556
Speed?
I could use some of that.

48
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,037
You got a girlfriend, Ace?

49
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,872
I used to,
but I spent all my time skiing.

50
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
She got tired
of being number two.

51
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,775
Hey, how old are you?

52
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,477
Eighteen, in April.

53
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,620
Ran away from home, right?

54
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,852
Wrong. You got to have a home
to run away from.

55
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,075
What?

56
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,581
I'm getting a room
for the night.

57
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,880
Hey, buddy, you figure you can
get in my pants this way.

58
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:24,718
I--I ain't figuring nothing.

59
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,054
Do you want to spend the night
out here in the truck?

60
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,218
It's OK by me.

61
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,874
Hey, Harky, you got something
I can wear to bed?

62
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,247
My mother forgot
to pack my pajamas.

63
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,544
Thank you.

64
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,316
You know
there's only one bed in here.

65
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,382
So?
Pick a side and stay there.

66
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,376
So, how come you didn't
try nothing last night?

67
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,073
I was tired.

68
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,849
You didn't exactly
invite me, anyway.

69
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,049
Are you for real?

70
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,295
Are you a virgin?

71
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,056
Are you?

72
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,203
Well,
you had your chance, fella.

73
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,402
I ain't half bad, you know.

74
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,713
So, what happens
in Squaw Valley besides skiing?

75
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,510
Beats me. I never been there.

76
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,210
You see,
I don't really have to be...

77
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,684
in San Francisco for a while...

78
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,017
and, well, maybe do you
just think I could--

79
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,680
Want to tag along?

80
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,520
Yeah. Why not?

81
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,856
OK, but no funny stuff.

82
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,226
I don't put out for everyone
I pick up.

83
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,422
Anybody home?

84
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,950
Damn it.

85
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:54,254
Someone's at the front desk.

86
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,788
I'll be right back.

87
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,482
Checking in?

88
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:17,248
Yeah. Banks, Harkin.

89
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,017
Freestyler?

90
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,689
It's the last room we had.
I was getting worried about you.

91
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,697
I'll bet.

92
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,790
Welcome to Squaw.

93
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,664
And call me
if you need anything.

94
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,193
Yeah, could you wash
our truck for us?

95
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,569
First thing in the morning.

96
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,598
Thanks. Come on, Harkin.

97
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,252
Wow! Get a load of this!

98
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,483
I can't believe it.

99
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,584
This looks like a cathouse.

100
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,118
Whoa! This is great!

101
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:04,565
And you were going
to stay here alone?

102
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,501
It was the only place
I could get.

103
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,576
Hey, Harkin, check this out.

104
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,912
How does it work?

105
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,818
I don't know. I think it's got
some jets or something...

106
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,981
that forces the water up.

107
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,888
A friend of mine stayed
in a place like this once...

108
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,587
but it was only for an hour.

109
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,352
Oh, don't stop!

110
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,550
- Oh, that feels good!
-I want more!

111
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,081
- Oh, do it!
-You like that, huh?

112
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,754
Yes, I do! Oh, I want more!

113
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,955
Touch me!

114
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,893
What do you say
we get something to eat?

115
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,397
Want to try these on?

116
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,034
Don't you like the way I dress?

117
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,067
I thought you might
look nice in them.

118
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,109
Am I gonna have
to wash dishes, Ace?

119
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,816
Un-uh. It's my treat.

120
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,552
Well, how can you afford
all of this?

121
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,993
The room, the food,
this sweater?

122
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,427
Well, my ma knit the sweater...

123
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,398
and I've been working all summer
for the money to make this trip.

124
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,560
I milked forty head of cattle
twice a day.

125
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,432
Whoa! Get a load of him.

126
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:55,236
- Oh, my God!
-You know him?

127
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,338
That's Rudolf Garmischt!

128
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,816
He won the gold medal
in Lake Placid in 1930...

129
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,254
and he's the world freestyle
champ the last 2 years running.

130
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,189
Damn sexy, too.

131
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,523
He's the best...

132
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,223
the world's greatest skier.

133
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,535
Mr. Garmischt?

134
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,638
I think you're the greatest.

135
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,281
So ein stupide Amerikaner.

136
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,720
Hey, Adolf!
Somebody's talking to you!

137
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,191
That will work in Europe, yeah?

138
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:55,001
There, the women are beautiful,
but also intelligent.

139
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,633
Rotate on this,
you nazi bastard!

140
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,139
Nice coat. Uh...rat?

141
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,640
You shouldn't have done that!
That was Rudolf Garmischt!

142
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,981
He's a jerk!

143
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,191
Always has been.

144
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,716
Greetings. Dan O'Callahan.

145
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,659
I've seen you
in all the ski magazines.

146
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,527
Dan here used to be
one of the best.

147
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,159
I still am.
What's your name?

148
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,032
I'm Harkin Banks. This is Sunny.

149
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,096
I came here to compete--
if I qualify.

150
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:32,597
You got to be pretty good
to make it on this circuit, kid.

151
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,842
You here to qualify, too?

152
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:39,712
- I ain't into skiing.
-Well, that's no problem.

153
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,581
Plenty of things to do here.

154
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,551
So, you met Rudi, huh?

155
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,651
Well, he might be a great skier,
but he's a world-class asshole.

156
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,726
Well, see you on the mountain,
huh, kid?

157
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,496
Yeah, I'll be there.

158
00:15:58,523 --> 00:15:59,695
Pleasure.

159
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,038
That guy wants
to get into my pants.

160
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,668
What?

161
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,939
He's got
another thing coming...

162
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,004
if he thinks
he's gonna make it with me.

163
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,038
I ain't into older men,
you know?

164
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,319
Where did you get
all this stuff?

165
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,351
Watch out, watch out.

166
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,957
Hey, watch it, buddy!
You jerk!

167
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,592
Come on, Ace,
I'll buy you a drink.

168
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,795
You got it.

169
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:46,038
All right!
Nice hand for The Breakers!

170
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,551
OK, get down here 'cause
you know what time it is?

171
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,575
Wet T-shirt contest time!

172
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,489
I'm Lester the Molester...

173
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,788
and I run the baddest, meanest
wet T-shirt contest there is!

174
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,590
But what do you need
to have a wet T-shirt contest?

175
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,461
Yeah, girls!
Let's get some girls up here!

176
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,329
Come on,
give me some girls up here!

177
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,301
All right!

178
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,014
We need more girls than this,
though, don't we?

179
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,516
More!

180
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
Yes, we do,
but in order to find girls...

181
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,611
I gotta get out my girlfinder!

182
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,231
Now, let's go for the girls!
Where are you, girls? Come on!

183
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,201
Better close this up--
don't want anybody to get hurt.

184
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,295
Hold this for me back there,
would you, darling?

185
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,499
Let's find some more girls.

186
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,337
How about this girl over here?

187
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,970
How about you, honey?
You want to get up here?

188
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,410
Hey, guys,
let's get that girl up here.

189
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:51,038
Oh, she's covering up.

190
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,707
Let's go into the back here.
How about that girl?

191
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,116
Guys, get her up here!
Come on! Bring her up here!

192
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,620
- I got fifty bucks on you.
-No way!

193
00:17:57,642 --> 00:18:00,145
Come on, baby! Let's go!

194
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:04,726
Oh, my lord!

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,229
How do you do, darling?
I'm new in town...

196
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,527
and I don't know
how to get to your house.

197
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,061
How about you, honey?

198
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,432
You look like you're
in the mood for a contest.

199
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,198
The guys are all
pulling for you.

200
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,263
You would be great in this!

201
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,001
I say, what do you say?

202
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,339
All right, all right!

203
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,776
Come on up here. Yeah.

204
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,939
OK, come on,
we need some more girls!

205
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:28,247
How about this girl back here?
Come on up here!

206
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,346
Yeah! Yeah! Come on up here!
Another volunteer!

207
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:36,223
Put me down! Come on,
put me down! Put me down!

208
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,024
How about this for a volunteer?

209
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,586
All right!

210
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,628
Let's see them titties!

211
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,108
You guys thought you'd have
seltzer bottles...

212
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,205
but I'm the one
who gets to do it.

213
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,544
Aw, this is great fun!

214
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,279
It's water time.
Get me a volunteer!

215
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,485
Take it off! Take it off!

216
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,730
Come on, wake up!

217
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,448
Oh once

218
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,851
We were dreamers on the rise

219
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,982
We were the sun

220
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:23,754
Where the sun never shines

221
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,352
And we were gold

222
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:31,031
Where the nightbird only flies

223
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,162
That's a long time, you know

224
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:38,163
For that kind of wind to blow

225
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,472
Long time ago

226
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:45,447
We were dreamers on the rise

227
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,915
Entwined

228
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,409
We said we'd begin again

229
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,718
And we made a vow

230
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,081
That we'd remain as friends

231
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,856
And we'd fallen down

232
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:03,298
We said we shall rise again

233
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,665
That's a long time, you know

234
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,365
For that kind of wind to blow

235
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,868
Long time ago

236
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:16,538
We were dreamers on the mend

237
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,809
Long time ago

238
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:23,047
We were dreamers on the mend

239
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:25,179
And if three

240
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,214
Wishes came into my life

241
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,227
I'd say one

242
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,627
Was to gaze into your eyes

243
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,792
And I'd say two

244
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:40,633
Would be turning back our lives

245
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,936
Three's a long way to go

246
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,943
For that kind of wind to blow

247
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,980
Long time ago

248
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,846
We were dreamers on the rise

249
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,478
Long time ago

250
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,682
We were dreamers on the rise

251
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,191
Long time ago

252
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:05,422
We were dreamers

253
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,365
On the rise

254
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,695
You play well.

255
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,334
Thanks. I wrote it myself.

256
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,970
You got more going for you
than skiing any day.

257
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,348
Yeah? My sister says that
I'm as good as John Denver.

258
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,682
She's not all wrong, Ace.

259
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,712
Yeah, well, she's just a kid.

260
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,319
Well, long day tomorrow.

261
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:42,592
I guess I'd better be
hitting the hay.

262
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,691
Mind if I join you?

263
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,098
Sure.

264
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,138
You son of a bitch!

265
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,913
You're not gonna fall asleep
on me two nights in a row!

266
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,338
Whoo! All right!

267
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,067
Nice turns!

268
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,006
Squirrel, look at this kid!

269
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,888
Yeah, the boy is good,
but I wouldn't worry about it.

270
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:13,373
Aspirin, drinky!

271
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,187
Hey, Dan! How you doing?

272
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:23,712
Not so loud, huh, kid?

273
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:26,055
I was up all night
doing a crossword puzzle.

274
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:28,622
You want a sip?

275
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,528
A strike!

276
00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:37,025
Hey, listen, kid, I saw your
qualifying run this morning.

277
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,699
- Not bad.
-Thanks. When are you running?

278
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,072
Oh, well, us vets--
we did it yesterday.

279
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,940
They don't post the results
till tonight...

280
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:45,740
so we're just gonna go out
and boogie, you know?

281
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,940
Just clean out the system.

282
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:51,883
Well, Harkin Banks,
I want you to meet the Rat Pack.

283
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:53,215
This is Squirrel Murphy.

284
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,050
Yeah, best run
of the morning, man!

285
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:56,852
What, were you
on 'shrooms or what?

286
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:59,916
He's a little crazier
than he looks. Come on.

287
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:03,395
Oh, and that's Kendo.

288
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:11,493
He's got a way with words, huh?

289
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,698
We call him Kamikaze.

290
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,003
When you see him ski,
you'll know why.

291
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,670
Oh, and that's Fergy,
the motormouth-shut up.

292
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,178
And then Banana Pants.

293
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,182
You can call her Michelle.
She's taken.

294
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,342
I am?

295
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:25,510
Cute, huh? Oh, and Slasher.

296
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,542
Slasher. Slasher.

297
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:30,580
Say hi to Harkin Banks.

298
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:32,091
Hey, Harkin.

299
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:35,118
Good, huh? Well, Harkin here
is gonna put the fear of God...

300
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,630
into Rudi Kazooti Garmischt.

301
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,365
He asked if you want to ski
with us this afternoon.

302
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:50,535
We're gonna hit
some radical terrain--

303
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:54,445
Avalanche City, Outta Bounds,
Squirrel Mountain.

304
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,312
Hey, sounds great.

305
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,874
Well, then
let's climb aboard...

306
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,443
in an orderly fashion--
spread out!

307
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:20,700
Good.

308
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:42,919
Hey, how you doing, Sylvia?

309
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,397
I'll be doing better once you
introduce me to your friend.

310
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,593
I saw him qualify on Red Dog.

311
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:50,569
He's real good.
You guys better watch out.

312
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:52,367
Are you gonna
introduce me or not?

313
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:55,375
Well, of course.
Hey, Hark, come here.

314
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,740
Harkin Banks,
I'd like you to meet Sylvia.

315
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:04,811
New on the circuit?

316
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:09,488
We're gonna go do Broken Arrow.
You want to ski with us?

317
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:12,185
Oh, I gotta get the house ready
for the big party tonight.

318
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:15,991
Oh, well, we'll see you tonight.
Can I bring you anything?

319
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,894
Bring him.

320
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
I might make him
the guest of honor.

321
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:23,096
Well, you know,
he's got a friend.

322
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:25,900
So, bring his friend.

323
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:28,840
OK. Can I bring you
anything else?

324
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:32,333
Just you, Daniel-Just you.

325
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,184
She always makes it
to the qualifying rounds.

326
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:45,088
That way she can check out
the new talent.

327
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:48,287
She is beautiful.

328
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:49,795
You got a good eye, kid.

329
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,398
Watch out! Watch out!

330
00:29:57,492 --> 00:30:01,030
Rudi, you're a goddamn
low-life cretinous slug!

331
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:07,876
You people, stay out of our way!

332
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:10,815
You may ski on that side
or on that side...

333
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,581
but stay out of the middle here.

334
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:16,145
Hey, Rudi, you can kiss my ass--

335
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:18,054
not on this side,
not on that side...

336
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,581
but right in ze middle.

337
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:27,758
Come, Heinz.
We finish this later.

338
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,243
What is it with that guy?

339
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,440
Sylvia used to be
Rudi's girlfriend...

340
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,574
till someone long-dicked her
in Europe.

341
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,551
He figures it was me.

342
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,881
Couldn't blame a guy,
though, could you?

343
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:49,115
Uh-uh. Sylvia's sure got
what it takes.

344
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:50,452
That's why
she's got the Rudettes...

345
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:51,855
drooling all over her.

346
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,383
- Rudettes?
-Rudi's gang.

347
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,054
They're so far up his ass,
they don't know...

348
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:58,758
where he leaves off
and they begin.

349
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:02,758
Hey, what do you say
we tear up this mountain?

350
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,202
OK, let's hit it!

351
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:06,705
All right, let's go!

352
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:08,002
Come on!

353
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:45,059
I swear to God,
it's the funniest thing...

354
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:46,394
you ever saw was Squirrel--

355
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,401
Hey, you guys
talking about me again?

356
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:52,064
Squirrel skiing with his pants
split up the middle.

357
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,505
Hey, it was too hot
to wear underwear.

358
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,601
So he skis down right in front
of the TV cameras, right?

359
00:33:57,632 --> 00:33:59,771
He passes,
and he bows to the judge.

360
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:03,146
He flashes the biggest moon
you ever seen in your life.

361
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,809
It must have been
a hell of a jump, Squirrel...

362
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,149
to rip your pants off.

363
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:11,686
Hey, Kendo's right.

364
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:14,626
I cranked off the triple,
I flew a hundred yards.

365
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:17,721
Fuckin'-A, man.
That jump was totally awesome.

366
00:34:18,987 --> 00:34:20,989
Guys, I'd like to propose
a little toast...

367
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:22,262
to Squirrel Murphy.

368
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,828
He's been on the world
freestyle circuit for 4 years.

369
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,807
He's made $392,
been laid twice.

370
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,834
Once every other year--
not bad, Squirrel.

371
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:35,507
And I would like to toast
Snake-legs Banks...

372
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,175
the Bonners Ferry flash...

373
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,082
the newest member
of the Rat Pack.

374
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,815
- All right!
-All right!

375
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,094
There it is.

376
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:02,338
- Do you see mine, Dan?
-Yeah, you're on it.

377
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:05,970
- What about me, Dan?
-Slasher, Kendo, Squirrel.

378
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,503
All right.
What about Fergy and Dagger?

379
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:10,106
That's it.

380
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:11,583
What the hell?

381
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:15,019
Fader, come back here,
goddamn it!

382
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:18,047
4 years on the circuit, and
he gets cut-you believe it?

383
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,717
Dagger and Fergy skied better...

384
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,385
than most of the Europeans
on the tour.

385
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,020
That doesn't seem fair.

386
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:24,724
It isn't.

387
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:27,192
Fender--

388
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:30,031
Dan, I know what you're gonna
say, but we're running a show.

389
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,038
Well, how come you cut
Fergy and Dagger?

390
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,801
- They just didn't make it.
-Didn't make it?

391
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:35,808
They ski better
than half the Europeans.

392
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,605
You call yourselves promoters?

393
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:40,738
It's a business. Accommodations
have to be made, O'Callahan.

394
00:35:40,768 --> 00:35:42,406
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

395
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,043
You know, I remember
when this used to be a sport.

396
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,019
We've got
fourteen European sponsors...

397
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,715
paying for TV coverage
for one name skier.

398
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:52,054
Lose that name,
and the circuit folds.

399
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,560
All right, now we're saddled
with European sponsors.

400
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,186
That means
certain Europeans qualify.

401
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:58,561
And certain Americans
don't qualify?

402
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:00,224
Hey, guys, we haven't had...

403
00:36:00,254 --> 00:36:02,291
an American winner
in over five years.

404
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,735
Now, look, Dan, there hasn't
been an American freestyler...

405
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,363
who could beat Garmischt
in five years.

406
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:09,170
We landed the meet here
because of him!

407
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:11,837
Oh, I see.

408
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:14,972
So, it's a business,
is that it, fellas?

409
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:20,476
O'Callahan, it's show business.

410
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,454
Yeah? Well, why don't you
explain that...

411
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:23,820
to those kids
that have traveled...

412
00:36:23,845 --> 00:36:25,825
over a thousand miles
to get here.

413
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,520
What are you getting
so bent out of shape for...

414
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:29,755
O'Callahan? You made it.

415
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,162
You've been over the hill
for five years.

416
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:34,893
Now, Dan.

417
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,737
I don't like that guy.

418
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:42,537
Come on, I'll buy you a beer,
we'll talk about it, hmm?

419
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:45,043
Fader, come on,
we go back a long way.

420
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,376
You're an old
free-dagger yourself.

421
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:50,076
Dan, I'm between a rock
and a hard place.

422
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:53,680
It's bullshit.

423
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:59,216
Bullshit.

424
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,531
- What was that?
-A burst of courage.

425
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:19,807
What's that mean?

426
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,144
It's a prescription
for crowd scenes.

427
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,281
You don't need that.

428
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:30,721
Look, Harkin, it's my business
what I swallow, OK?

429
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:39,363
Well, what was it?

430
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:41,993
What difference does it make?

431
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,798
Well, I don't like it.

432
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:46,362
Well, tough.
What do you think...

433
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:49,068
we spend one night together,
and you own me?

434
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:12,325
Good evening, Harkin.

435
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:16,499
So glad you could make it.

436
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:17,764
Your friend?

437
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:21,330
Yeah. Sylvia, this is Sunny.
Sunny, Sylvia.

438
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,741
You were terrific today, Harkin.

439
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:26,871
I haven't seen a skier
like you in years...

440
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,278
and I've seen them all.

441
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:31,078
I'll bet you have.

442
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:32,482
Thanks.

443
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:34,680
- Are you a skier?
-No.

444
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,347
Just a spectator, then?

445
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:39,358
Right, except I haven't
found the mountain yet.

446
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,691
Ah, well, it's the big hill
with the snow all over it.

447
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:44,822
I'll keep an eye out for it.

448
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,891
- She's very interesting.
-Yeah.

449
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:54,702
Well, it's a really nice place
you have here.

450
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:56,140
Thank you.

451
00:38:56,164 --> 00:38:59,304
I've scheduled you
for a private tour later on.

452
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:02,075
I don't think I want you
to miss anything.

453
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,322
- Hey, kid.
-Oh, hey, Dan.

454
00:39:19,353 --> 00:39:22,197
Wild party. Better keep an eye
on your girlfriend.

455
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:29,298
- She's not my girlfriend.
-Right.

456
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:29,061
I'm Squirrel Murphy.

457
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,070
Georgette.

458
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:34,301
I suppose a fuck's
out of the question, huh?

459
00:40:35,763 --> 00:40:37,970
Ask me
when I'm in a better mood.

460
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:03,464
The air is so clean
in the mountains.

461
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:06,438
Yeah. It's just like back home.

462
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,031
- Where's home?
-In Bonners Ferry, Idaho...

463
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:11,373
where the men are men,
and the sheep are nervous.

464
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:15,379
Well, you wouldn't
make me nervous.

465
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:18,740
A little excited, maybe.

466
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:23,085
Let me buy you a drink.

467
00:41:24,078 --> 00:41:25,250
Come on.

468
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,307
- I don't understand.
-I don't either.

469
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:06,621
A toast to Dom Perignon
and the World Cup.

470
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:07,758
Who's he?

471
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:12,369
A famous French skier.

472
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,963
I never heard of him.

473
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,218
So, what happens now?

474
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:42,391
First,
we take off our clothes...

475
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:44,926
and then we fuck our brains out.

476
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:36,081
Hey, who needs a drink?
Miss, could I--

477
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:38,640
Fergy. will you let the lady
sit down, please?

478
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:40,481
What can I get you?

479
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,612
I don't know.

480
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,852
How about something hot?

481
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,155
Hot.

482
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:52,995
Uh, may I recommend
my specialty-the leg spreader?

483
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,093
It starts with a little vodka...

484
00:44:57,124 --> 00:44:59,730
and a touch of scotch.

485
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,966
You're gonna love this.

486
00:45:01,996 --> 00:45:03,873
Then...

487
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:06,606
a little bit of brandy.

488
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:08,580
This will pick you up.

489
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:13,347
A skosh
of Mother's Myers's rum...

490
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:19,187
and the blessings
of a lemon twist.

491
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:24,124
Try that on for size.

492
00:45:46,774 --> 00:45:48,879
It's working.

493
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:52,049
Now, that's a girl
I can take advantage of.

494
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,558
Now, Squirrel.

495
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:12,700
I hope that's your leg.

496
00:47:13,227 --> 00:47:16,231
It feels very good, ja?

497
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:21,572
Excuse me.

498
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:23,582
Please, don't worry.

499
00:47:23,604 --> 00:47:25,550
We are all friends here.

500
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,576
Be my guest.

501
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,886
I think you need some fluid.

502
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:33,118
Some more.

503
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,620
Please, you finish.

504
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:51,839
You know, I'm very sorry...

505
00:47:51,865 --> 00:47:54,812
that we didn't get along
so well...

506
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:56,872
the first time that we met.

507
00:47:58,305 --> 00:48:00,842
It was a long day,
and I had a headache...

508
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:05,880
and I must apologize
for the way that I acted.

509
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:08,792
But I hope
that you understand...

510
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:12,320
that I'm really not
such a bad guy.

511
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:18,627
Just-just relax.

512
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:22,438
That is why we are here.

513
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,476
Just relax.

514
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:51,697
Aw, man.

515
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,705
Aw, Dan, what happened?

516
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:57,834
Well, I was fixing a drink,
and I hit a tree.

517
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,572
Compound spiral.

518
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,705
Hey, Dan, you think maybe
I can use your skis...

519
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:02,873
while you're laid up?

520
00:49:02,903 --> 00:49:06,942
Well, it might not be that bad!
Let's party!

521
00:49:08,242 --> 00:49:09,516
Who wants a beer?

522
00:49:11,945 --> 00:49:13,982
Guys, let's get out of here!

523
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,891
Hey, let's go!

524
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,590
Get ready to party.
Who wants a beer down here?

525
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:26,829
Well, look who's here--
Mr. Personality.

526
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,568
Was ist los? lhr schweinhund.

527
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:31,633
No kidding?

528
00:49:31,665 --> 00:49:34,407
Hey, Rudi, have a beer on me.

529
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:39,877
Say, little rookie...

530
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,987
do you know what I had
for breakfast this morning?

531
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,584
Wheaties.

532
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:50,925
Very clever, but no.

533
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,864
No, it was quite a feast, ja.

534
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:57,130
How do you say
in your language--

535
00:49:57,157 --> 00:50:01,162
I had Sunny side up,
and I had Sunny side down...

536
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:06,577
and I had Sunny side
all the way around.

537
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,978
You toad-sucking son of a bitch!

538
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,979
Don't worry.

539
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:15,111
I threw the little fish back
when I finished with her.

540
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:17,850
Rudi,
you hit a new low this time.

541
00:50:17,878 --> 00:50:20,722
Oh. You're hurting my feelings,
my good friend.

542
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:23,353
- Hey, Garmshit.
-Garmischt.

543
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:25,761
Yeah, Garmshit. Why don't you
ask the rookie here...

544
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:28,824
about his bubble bath
with Sylvia last night?

545
00:50:28,856 --> 00:50:30,836
That's right. Rudi.
You've been backdoored again...

546
00:50:30,858 --> 00:50:32,462
but this time,
right in the same house.

547
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:36,373
Yeah, you just ain't staying
on Sylvia's top forty, shorty.

548
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:43,838
Ja, we will see you showoffs,
you comedians, tonight, ja?

549
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:46,215
If you are not cowards.

550
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,049
And I especially hope
that you, little rookie...

551
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:50,555
won't be too shy to join us.

552
00:50:50,577 --> 00:50:52,113
I'll be there.

553
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:03,102
Be where?

554
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:04,262
Rudi challenged us...

555
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,898
to a broom-ball match
tonight at the Arena.

556
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:08,236
All right.

557
00:51:08,263 --> 00:51:11,574
Welcome, everybody,
to the first major event...

558
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,374
of the F.l.S.
World Cup competition...

559
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:15,074
here in Squaw Valley, U.S.A...

560
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:18,607
site of the 1960
Winter Olympic Games.

561
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,677
We're here on East Broadway...

562
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,188
to see the finest
freestyle skiers in the world...

563
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:25,714
going for the gold
in three events--

564
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:26,953
ballet this afternoon...

565
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:29,894
moguls tomorrow,
and aerials on Sunday.

566
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:43,536
Into the starting gate...

567
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:46,341
Good luck, Slasher.
Go get 'em, buddy!

568
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:47,607
...from
Breckenridge, Colorado.

569
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:56,311
Curtis, W.

570
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,824
Well, Curtis, you can take
your starting position.

571
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:03,360
Take your starting position.

572
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:10,895
Why don't you turn that down?

573
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:07,626
Next up is number 101...

574
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:10,220
- Herr Garmischt.
-Ja.

575
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,492
- Good luck.
-Luck?

576
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,160
I don't need luck.

577
00:53:16,557 --> 00:53:18,195
Take your starting position.

578
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:30,600
That was Rudolf Garmischt...

579
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:33,305
in a beautifully
choreographed routine.

580
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:35,075
And now for
the judges' scores--

581
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:40,212
9.5, 9.3, 9.5, 9.2, 9.3.

582
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:43,154
That's today's best score.

583
00:54:43,177 --> 00:54:44,417
All right, Banks,
good luck to you.

584
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:45,981
You can take
your starting position.

585
00:54:46,013 --> 00:54:47,185
Thank you.

586
00:56:05,426 --> 00:56:09,374
That was Harkin Banks
in a beautiful first run...

587
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:10,842
in the F.l.S. World Cup.

588
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:12,469
Let's hear it
for this newcomer...

589
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,173
in his first
international competition.

590
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:18,207
Hey! My man!
You did it! You did it!

591
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:23,314
3.7, 3.6, 3.4, 3.6, 3.2.

592
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:24,721
Aw, come on.

593
00:56:26,147 --> 00:56:28,286
You had the best run
on the hill, man.

594
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:30,193
You got screwed.

595
00:56:54,308 --> 00:56:57,687
- Well, where are you going?
-San Francisco.

596
00:56:57,712 --> 00:57:00,750
It's time for me to move on.

597
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:02,692
Well, where were you
last night?

598
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,890
You sure ask a lot of questions.

599
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:07,695
Well, I was worried.

600
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:10,566
- I'm sure.
-I was.

601
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:13,071
You were with Rudi,
weren't you?

602
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:15,233
And what difference
would it make?

603
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:18,733
What do you mean,
what difference would it make?

604
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:21,303
And what were you doing
in the hot tub with Sylvia?

605
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:25,411
You surprise me, too, H.

606
00:57:25,439 --> 00:57:28,682
- She gave me this stuff.
-Oh, that's bullshit!

607
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:30,120
I didn't know what I was doing.

608
00:57:30,144 --> 00:57:32,886
Tell me about it.

609
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:35,588
- Don't forget your shampoo.
-It's already packed.

610
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:40,596
I think you should stay, Sunny.

611
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:45,571
Here. Don't forget this.

612
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:53,209
Give it to your girlfriend,
Miss Plastic Tits.

613
00:58:03,544 --> 00:58:06,855
Company, halt!

614
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,326
Ready...

615
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:10,056
They look nervous.

616
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:12,121
Hey. guys. anything goes.

617
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:14,497
That's right. Take no prisoners.

618
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:18,664
Eins, zwei, drei, vier!
Eins, zwei, drei, vier!

619
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:22,399
- Squirrel.
-All right.

620
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,703
Maybe we should spot them
a couple goals.

621
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:28,873
What do you think, guys?

622
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:30,041
They're not gonna play serious,
are they?

623
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:31,482
I don't think so, no.

624
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,985
- Break!
-Break!

625
00:58:34,008 --> 00:58:36,181
- You guys ready?
-Yeah!

626
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,553
- You ready?
-Jawohl!

627
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:42,425
OK, play hard, play fair,
and keep your sticks down.

628
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:55,105
Great job!

629
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:57,636
Come on!

630
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:37,943
You busy for dinner?

631
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:44,385
- Get out of here!
-Out of the way!

632
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:45,584
Come on!

633
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:18,081
You know something, guys?
I'm getting too old for this.

634
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:20,786
Did you see that Garmischt
blind-side me?

635
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,624
They were vicious, but we tried.

636
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,066
Yeah. Hey, we were small,
but we were slow.

637
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:29,261
Funny.

638
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:32,199
Yeah, next time!

639
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:35,696
Next time, we'll have uniforms!

640
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,903
Hey, you guys want to go
for a nightcap at the Lone Star?

641
01:00:37,932 --> 01:00:40,071
Oh, hey, listen, man.
We'll join you later.

642
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,944
Me and the kid,
we got something to do.

643
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:44,415
This game's not over yet.

644
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:47,214
Let's show 'em
a little Irish hospitality.

645
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:49,915
Rudi! He's gonna love this.

646
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:53,756
Son of a bitch!

647
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,085
Come on.

648
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:07,531
Luck of the Irish.

649
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:10,440
- How did you do that?
-It's my lock.

650
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:16,675
Come on.

651
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:28,949
Look what we found.

652
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:43,064
All right, guys. Watch this.

653
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:03,794
What the--Heinz!

654
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,763
Rat Pack.

655
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:38,091
Can I give you a hand
with that?

656
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:39,153
No, thanks. I got it.

657
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:40,824
- You sure?
-Yeah, sure.

658
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:13,531
Son of a bitch!

659
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,131
You!

660
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:19,694
I saw you fall.

661
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,503
I thought I'd just stop
and give you a few pointers.

662
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:24,133
Yeah, you've got a couple,
so why don't you...

663
01:03:24,164 --> 01:03:26,644
point 'em that way
and crawl out of my sight?

664
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:28,669
Aw, you gotta learn
to bend your knees.

665
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:31,945
Get your mama to bend her knees.
I don't have time.

666
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:34,543
That way you could
suck up the bumps.

667
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:39,486
You do know how to do that,
don't you?

668
01:03:39,513 --> 01:03:41,857
Here, let me give you a hand.

669
01:03:41,882 --> 01:03:45,455
I can see why Harkin likes you.

670
01:03:45,486 --> 01:03:47,830
Oh, I get it. Switch hitter--

671
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:50,461
first Harkin and now me.

672
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:53,438
You really are a sicko, lady!

673
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,101
Maybe you and Harkin--
we could all get together later.

674
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:59,907
Harkin can do
whatever the hell he pleases!

675
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:02,778
All I was doing was having
a little fun with him.

676
01:04:02,803 --> 01:04:04,043
You can have him back.

677
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:07,712
Ooh, if I could only ski,
I'd take this pole and--

678
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:09,778
If you get bored with Harkin,
send him over later on.

679
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:12,222
I still have a few tricks
up my sleeve.

680
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:16,725
Oh, so what, bitch?

681
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,000
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

682
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:23,933
Welcome
to the mogul competition...

683
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,438
the second event
of this championship weekend.

684
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,098
After the ballet competition...

685
01:04:28,128 --> 01:04:30,972
Rudolf Garmischt of Austria
is in first place...

686
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:33,706
followed by Werner Bleiner
of West Germany in second...

687
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:35,441
Heinz Hartmann of Austria
in third...

688
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:37,972
Kendo Yamamoto of Japan
in fourth position...

689
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:40,576
and newcomer Harkin Banks
of the United States...

690
01:04:40,607 --> 01:04:41,813
in fifth place.

691
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:44,413
Right behind Banks in sixth
is Dan O'Callahan...

692
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:46,322
of the U.S.,
followed by Squirrel...

693
01:04:46,347 --> 01:04:48,793
I'm after Rudi.

694
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:50,352
The luck of the draw.

695
01:04:50,384 --> 01:04:51,988
It's a tough act to follow...

696
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:54,090
but if you ski like you did
when you qualified...

697
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,260
you could be the kid
we're looking for.

698
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,889
And now the current
world champion...

699
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:29,190
Rudi Garmischt,
to the starting gate.

700
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:34,499
Garmischt,
any time you're ready, huh?

701
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:36,194
Just a moment.

702
01:07:19,266 --> 01:07:20,438
Go, Rudi!

703
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,607
A spectacular run
by Rudi Garmischt!

704
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,275
In a moment,
the judges' scores.

705
01:07:25,305 --> 01:07:28,218
One thing about Rudi,
he sure can ski.

706
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:32,190
9.7, 9.3, 9.7, 9.9, 10.

707
01:07:32,212 --> 01:07:35,455
49.1! Beautiful!

708
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:37,621
He might have been great once.

709
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:40,097
He wasn't that good today.

710
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,724
Kid, let me tell you something.

711
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:43,860
He didn't win the World Cup
three years in a row...

712
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:45,131
because he's bad.

713
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:48,003
Next up is Harkin Banks,
number 149.

714
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:49,200
Go get 'em, kid.

715
01:07:56,637 --> 01:08:00,710
Hey, Banks, nice run in ballet
the other day, huh?

716
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,153
- Thank you.
-Yeah, it's all right.

717
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:05,020
Well, it's any time
you're ready now.

718
01:08:05,045 --> 01:08:06,547
Good luck.

719
01:08:24,164 --> 01:08:25,336
All right!

720
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:42,483
Yeah, all right!

721
01:09:01,535 --> 01:09:02,673
You did it!

722
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:04,740
Harkin Banks!
A beautiful run...

723
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:07,115
in his first
international competition!

724
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,815
- All right!
-Here come the judges' scores.

725
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:17,989
7.3, 3.3, 9.0, 3.0, 7.9".

726
01:09:18,018 --> 01:09:21,295
For a total of 41.0.

727
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:23,460
Bullshit! Bullshit!

728
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:26,997
Come on!

729
01:09:27,027 --> 01:09:28,165
What's the matter
with you guys?

730
01:09:28,195 --> 01:09:30,971
- You suck!
-Squirrel.

731
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:03,604
Attention, please.

732
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:05,610
Will all finalists
in the aerials...

733
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:08,943
please report to the top
of the jump immediately.

734
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:10,778
Competition will begin
in thirty minutes.

735
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,374
Thank you.

736
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:18,613
Hey, guys, there are
only four seats to a gondola...

737
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,283
so someone's gonna have
to ride by himself.

738
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:22,453
Let's throw
one or two fingers...

739
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:24,393
to see who stays behind.
You ready?

740
01:10:24,418 --> 01:10:27,763
One, two, three!

741
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:31,292
Sorry, Squirrel. Come on, guys.

742
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:41,545
The best two out of three?

743
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:25,946
What's your name?

744
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:28,756
Squirrel.

745
01:11:29,783 --> 01:11:31,922
That's cute.

746
01:11:31,952 --> 01:11:35,490
- What's yours?
-Vicki.

747
01:11:41,395 --> 01:11:42,635
You missed a spot.

748
01:11:45,098 --> 01:11:46,702
What, here?

749
01:11:57,344 --> 01:12:00,325
You never know where
you're gonna get burned.

750
01:12:01,915 --> 01:12:04,327
You don't want to miss
any spots.

751
01:12:12,759 --> 01:12:14,761
No, you sure don't.

752
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,351
Squirrel, all right!

753
01:13:12,419 --> 01:13:13,591
All right, Squirrel!

754
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:40,690
Welcome, everybody.

755
01:13:40,714 --> 01:13:44,890
As we go into the final event
of this F.l.S. World Cup...

756
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:46,955
Rudolf Garmischt
is in first place...

757
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:48,933
Harkin Banks in second...

758
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:50,798
Heinz Hartmann
in third position...

759
01:13:50,824 --> 01:13:52,633
Kendo Yamamoto in fourth...

760
01:13:52,659 --> 01:13:56,129
and in fifth place,
in a surprise return to form...

761
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:58,540
Squaw Valley's
favorite freestyler...

762
01:13:58,565 --> 01:14:00,238
Dan O'Callahan.

763
01:14:11,611 --> 01:14:14,683
Ah, Mr. Yamamoto. How are you?

764
01:14:14,714 --> 01:14:18,161
Good, good. So, what jump
have you got for us today?

765
01:14:19,819 --> 01:14:22,561
All right.
Yeah, we got Yamamoto ready.

766
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:24,728
He's gonna throw a sai, a sush-

767
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:28,433
mits-sushi mitsabish--
yama-what?

768
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:31,099
Did you get that?

769
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:33,008
That's close enough.

770
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:34,603
OK. All set?

771
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:36,079
You can go.

772
01:14:39,272 --> 01:14:40,546
Banzai!

773
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,673
All right!

774
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:17,574
A beautiful jump
by Harkin Banks!

775
01:16:17,604 --> 01:16:19,049
That's gonna put him
within striking distance...

776
01:16:19,072 --> 01:16:20,210
of Rudi Garmischt.

777
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,412
All right.

778
01:16:22,942 --> 01:16:24,387
The pressure's on, Rudi.

779
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:25,754
Ladies and gentlemen...

780
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:28,726
we are now down to
the last two jumps of the day.

781
01:16:28,748 --> 01:16:30,421
The results of these jumps...

782
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:34,023
will determine the overall
F.I.S. World Cup champion.

783
01:16:34,054 --> 01:16:35,624
Well, kinda looks like...

784
01:16:35,655 --> 01:16:37,896
you got your work cut out
for you today, huh, Rudi?

785
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:40,748
I have nothing to worry about.

786
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,943
What's your pleasure?

787
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,819
A lay tuck tuck triple.

788
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:49,551
OK. Yeah,
we got Garmischt all set.

789
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:51,559
He's throwing a triple.

790
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:55,154
A lay tuck tuck triple.

791
01:16:55,185 --> 01:16:57,187
Right.

792
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,393
OK, Rudi, you can go anytime.

793
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,264
That was Rudi Garmischt...

794
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:37,670
with a spectacularly executed
triple jump.

795
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,037
Not bad.

796
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:43,170
No shit.

797
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,375
A 9.8, 9.9, 9.8, a 10,
and a 9.9.

798
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:49,315
It's gonna be hard
to beat that one.

799
01:17:49,339 --> 01:17:51,842
...for a total of 49.4.

800
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,353
Yeah! Nice going!

801
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:04,354
What's this "Kiss-ass blaster"?

802
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:07,895
My jump.

803
01:18:07,924 --> 01:18:09,460
Yeah, well,
I got to know what it is...

804
01:18:09,492 --> 01:18:11,563
before I can let you go down.

805
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:14,574
It's a twist and triple.

806
01:18:14,597 --> 01:18:16,736
A twist and triple?

807
01:18:16,766 --> 01:18:18,370
I've never seen
one of those before.

808
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:19,778
Are you qualified for that?

809
01:18:22,605 --> 01:18:24,585
Well, I'm gonna do it.

810
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:36,987
Good luck.

811
01:19:25,402 --> 01:19:27,473
Let's hear it
for Harkin Banks--

812
01:19:27,504 --> 01:19:30,007
a beautiful triple
by this exciting newcomer...

813
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:31,712
from Bonners Ferry, Idaho!

814
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:39,520
Hey, look at that!

815
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:44,623
9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.3,
and a 9.3.

816
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:47,362
That makes Rudolf Garmischt
all-around world champion...

817
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,802
with a clean sweep
of all events.

818
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:53,672
Second overall is Harkin Banks
in his first F.l.S. competition.

819
01:20:01,805 --> 01:20:07,346
Hey, Rudi, how's it feel to win
and be second best?

820
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:19,293
Hey, come back here,
you goddamn coward!

821
01:20:57,093 --> 01:20:58,538
We win the trophy!

822
01:21:03,099 --> 01:21:04,339
Congratulations.

823
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:42,844
Cut it out!

824
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,816
You know something, Rudi?

825
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:22,311
I think it's time
we settle this once and for all.

826
01:22:22,345 --> 01:22:26,487
Hey, Squirrel,
spot me fifty bucks.

827
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:28,518
Fifty?

828
01:22:28,551 --> 01:22:30,531
Make it forty.

829
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:41,774
Chinese downhill.
Forty bucks a man.

830
01:22:41,798 --> 01:22:44,108
Winner takes all.

831
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:47,774
Ja. It is the only way--

832
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:49,545
Chinese downhill!

833
01:22:49,572 --> 01:22:52,178
Oh, and, uh, Rudi...

834
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:53,949
why don't you bring the trophy?

835
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:57,117
I think it should go
to the real champion.

836
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
I am the champion.

837
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:03,921
The Chinese downhill
will decide everything.

838
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:08,359
Ja. It is agreed.

839
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:11,372
Chinese downhill.

840
01:23:14,664 --> 01:23:17,372
What the fuck
is Chinese downhill?

841
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,097
Good luck, kid.

842
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:48,225
See you at the bottom.

843
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,405
Oh, boy.

844
01:25:09,912 --> 01:25:12,017
All right.
Listen up, everybody!

845
01:25:12,048 --> 01:25:13,186
And now for the rules...

846
01:25:13,216 --> 01:25:15,423
of the international
Chinese downhill--

847
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:17,488
there are none.

848
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,194
It's every man for himself.

849
01:25:20,223 --> 01:25:22,362
Anything goes.

850
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:24,371
The first man
to cross the finish line...

851
01:25:24,393 --> 01:25:26,873
and grab the trophy
wins the downhill.

852
01:25:26,896 --> 01:25:30,867
And the winner takes all--
2,300 bucks!

853
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:36,177
Everybody,
on your marks, get set...

854
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,465
Out of the way!

855
01:28:03,019 --> 01:28:04,794
Sayonara!

856
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,531
Wipe-out!

857
01:29:08,617 --> 01:29:10,893
Scratch an itch?

858
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:56,436
Watch out!
