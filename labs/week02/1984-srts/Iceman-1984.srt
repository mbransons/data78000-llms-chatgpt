1
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,196
Just run the cable
from the block over to...

2
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,996
Get some ropes
to steady it with.

3
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,378
Could be a bear, huh?

4
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,008
All right, pull the cable
in this way.

5
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,979
Take up the slack.

6
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,985
Okay, let's go!

7
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,157
Damn it, Shepherd,
close the door please.

8
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,576
Hey, Shepherd, you been out
with the natives again?

9
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,381
Hey! Even Eskimos don't dress like that anymore.

10
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,416
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go!
They're waiting for you! Today, Shepherd!

11
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,950
Today?

12
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,860
<i>You know, Whitman's in from Houston,
you better get cleaned-up.</i>

13
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,689
Jesus! What is that smell?

14
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,420
It's me.

15
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:40,553
Hey! Hey! You been eating walrus again?

16
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,400
- Hey, Shepherd, those Eskimos still lend you their wives?
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

17
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:51,211
Jesus! "Eskimos lend their wives."?

18
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:56,250
I'll see ya...
half that shit from the bear's here.

19
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:11,176
- Mr. Whitman, Brady.
- Where the hell have you been?

20
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,290
- Shepherd.
- What the hell is that?

21
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,972
- What the hell's that smell.
- What's goin' on? When did HE get here?

22
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,539
- What is going on?
- You're going to tell us.

23
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,140
- Well, give me a hint!
- Well, it's something we found in the glacier.

24
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,416
The Glacier!
Well, why wasn't I called?

25
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,987
- You were.
- Before you moved it! What... don't you know regulations?

26
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:28,726
There was no time. I mean, it could have
shifted, we could have lost it.

27
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,676
We got pictures of the site,
and we got ice samples, all right?

28
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,987
- Well, what is it?
- We're not sure... remember the mammoth?

29
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:37,119
- Yeah, the ones the Russians found.
- The Russians? When did they find a mammoth?

30
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,905
In 1898, it was a perfect specimen of the
mammoth mastodonis, 400 thousand years old.

31
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,733
Tissue was perfectly preserved,
some of the cells still viable.

32
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,699
So you found another mammoth?

33
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,702
Not exactly.

34
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,048
Viable? What did they do with this mammoth?

35
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,376
They ate it.

36
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:57,362
Yeah, and I heard it was quite
tasty, too, sorta like buffalo.

37
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,562
Joe, this is Dima, a baby mammoth,

38
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,820
One of thirty-nine recent finds.

39
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,734
The Russians have been working
on this for the last seven years.

40
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,448
They take the cells out of the mammoth,
they try to re-vivify them.

41
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,272
- What do you mean by re-vivify.
- Life, bring 'em back to life.

42
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,184
They insert them into the egg of a living elephant.

43
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:51,355
- What does that get you?
- Maybe a baby prehistoric?

44
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,730
Or a "malaphant".

45
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:55,554
Excuse me.

46
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,614
What are your plans here?
It looks like a pretty important find.

47
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:06,462
How far can you go?
Can you re-vivify the whole thing?

48
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:11,790
That's not possible. When you freeze,
crystals form, they destroy the cell walls.

49
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:15,764
If we're lucky, out of the whole carcass,
we'll find just a few cells intact.

50
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,248
Can you put those in an egg?

51
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:21,155
We're going to look for low level
cell activity, the beginnings of life.

52
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,352
Is that likely?

53
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,249
We don't know 'til we try.

54
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,323
- Wha... what about me?
- You?

55
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,625
I thought you might want to get
a look at it before we take it apart.

56
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,732
- Before what!?
- Before we take it apart.

57
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:38,875
Take it apart!?

58
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,041
Wait!

59
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:06,699
What do you think?

60
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,020
<i>Could've gone another two
inches, gotten a better look at it.</i>

61
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:12,588
- What do you think it is?
- Mammoth.

62
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:16,023
We think it's a mammoth.

63
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,502
Nothing, I can see nothing so far.

64
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,200
- Shepherd?
- Yeah.

65
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:51,111
Damn! It's not close enough.

66
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,215
If we cut on the other side we'll know
exactly which angle to come in on.

67
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,317
This is how we expect
to find you one day, Shepherd.

68
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:19,867
Brady.

69
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,651
- Oh, my God.
- That's it, that's amazing!

70
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,173
Jesus!

71
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,533
<i>Look at that, it must
have been frozen instantly.</i>

72
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,926
- What in God's name is he?
- Looks like an Indian.

73
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,410
- Yeah, what kind of Indian, I wonder.
- Cleveland Indian, what do I know, you're the anthropologist.

74
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:01,133
Is this...?

75
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,430
C'mon, c'mon, Shep, you're the expert.

76
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:11,305
I don't know, I mean, all we had was pieces of rock,
bone, conjecture, wild guesses, nothing in the flesh.

77
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,247
Well, take a wild guess.

78
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:19,007
Moderate frontal ridge, look at
those teeth, he's a hunter.

79
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,712
- Sloping forehead.
- How old?

80
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,849
- Hard to tell, adult, twenty, thirty.
- Thirty years?

81
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:29,607
- Give or take twenty thous...
- Twenty thousand?

82
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:35,242
Twenty thousand, maybe forty thousand.

83
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:41,872
You found a god damned Neanderthal.

84
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,263
Dr. Brady, we've got to be very careful...

85
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,564
What do you mean you're going to take him apart?

86
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,264
- We're taping everything, you'll have pictures...
- I don't want pictures, I want him!

87
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,437
- You'll have him... most of him.
- What do you mean most of him?

88
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,575
Well, we'd like to keep all of him here, but we're
probably gonna have to send his brain to Cambridge,

89
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,685
- his spinal ganglia to Berkeley...
- Where does his heart go, San Francisco?

90
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:40,448
Houston, then there's Sloan-Kettering, there's McGill, King's College,
but most of this stuff stays right here.

91
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,107
Why can't you just wait, huh?
I mean, what... what... who...

92
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,722
Okay, ready to start the thaw.

93
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,142
Dr. Brady.

94
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:17,312
Dr. Brady, what about the site?
What about others?

95
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:19,172
- He was alone.
- How do you know?

96
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,807
- My men searched the area, they sent-out probes.
- Well, keep searching.

97
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:24,416
Fine.

98
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:29,221
He came from somewhere, we could find
it, there could be a settlement, a camp.

99
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:33,519
I mean, this could be very important to us,
there could be another Troy buried underneath it.

100
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,653
Well, where DID he come from?

101
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:38,900
Which direction? How far? How long has he
been in that ice? How far has that ice traveled?

102
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:42,470
- You know what you're talking about?
- Yeah, thousands of square miles.

103
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,157
Right.

104
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:05,685
<i>Makes five point five.</i>

105
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:08,973
<i>Minus five.</i>

106
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:09,758
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

107
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:14,576
<i>- Minus four point five.
- Okay, thoracic, pumpers are pumping.</i>

108
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,511
<i>- Everyone ready.
- Minus four.</i>

109
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,196
- All systems go?
- Yes.

110
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:19,880
- Coming-up together.
- What's going on?

111
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,582
The Iceman warmeth.

112
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,855
- Why am I always the last to know?
- Didn't your mother tell you not to be an anthropologist?

113
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:27,636
- Yeah.
- Now you know why. Maynard, is nothing working?

114
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,469
- Not yet.
- What's the problem?

115
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,676
Knowing where to bang it.

116
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:31,882
<i>Minus two point five.</i>

117
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,725
- Maynard, is it going to work?
- I don't know.

118
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,060
- Do you wanna abort?
- This is it my student.

119
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,533
No, it's not important.
We go on.

120
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,161
- Threshold.
- Threshold, minus one point five.

121
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,559
- Stand by.
- There go the crystals.

122
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:46,266
- We have thaw!
- All right, all right, all right!!

123
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:54,817
Scalpel.

124
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,824
<i>- Yowza.
- Prepare for incision.</i>

125
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:00,162
<i>Plus two point five.</i>

126
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:01,872
<i>Plus two point seven.</i>

127
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,158
- Clamps.
- Right, right.

128
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,498
Let's connect the hoses.

129
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,555
- Sutures.
- Sutures.

130
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,693
Okay, let's get the skins off quickly.

131
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:10,890
<i>Plus three point six.</i>

132
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:13,037
<i>Plus four degrees.</i>

133
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,697
<i>Four point four.</i>

134
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:17,327
<i>Four point five.</i>

135
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:19,863
<i>Plus four point...</i>

136
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:23,605
<i>It looks pretty good to me.</i>

137
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,577
<i>- E.K.G. tabs in place?
- Yes.</i>

138
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,659
<i>- E.E.G. ready?
- Affirmative.</i>

139
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:04,165
- Tape.
- Tape.

140
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:08,023
<i>- Bypass complete.
- Two fifty, shooting ep.</i>

141
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,969
- Don't let it.
- Start the pumps.

142
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,099
<i>Frank, hold it right there,
Up maybe a half.</i>

143
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:23,013
Let's get to the
electrolytes. Read them.

144
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:23,645
<i>Twenty degrees.</i>

145
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:24,733
Kill that alarm.

146
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:25,777
Pressure?

147
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:29,591
Potassium level 50 mill equivalent,
a php 6.3

148
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,468
- E.K.G.?
- These are thousand dollar circuit boards!

149
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:32,326
Flatline.

150
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,375
- E.E.G.?
- Flatline.

151
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,765
- Is it working?
- I think so.

152
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,211
Hey, can I get a clo... I can't see his chest,
can I get a close-up on that?

153
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:42,146
Oh, sure, Shepherd, I got nothin' better to do.

154
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,481
- Make you happy?
- Yes.

155
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:51,409
- The Denys transfusions were good?
- The artificial blood, no reaction.

156
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,819
<i>- Flatline.
- Start your skin biopsy.</i>

157
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:01,233
<i>That stiff ain't stiff.</i>

158
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:06,447
He can relax, which is more
than I can say for some of us around here.

159
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,093
- Is my stuff in your way, Shepherd?
- Oh, sorry.

160
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:19,812
<i>E.K.G. flatline, E.E.G. flatline.</i>

161
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,871
- Status report.
- E.K.G. flatline.

162
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:28,102
- Flatline.
- Oxygenation?

163
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:30,663
- P-O-2 one twenty.
- Twelve point six.

164
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:34,145
Increase the flow rate 5 liters per minute.
Serum electrolytes?

165
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:39,375
Rising P.H. six point nine.
Coming-up fast, 15 degrees.

166
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:42,781
- Now it's dropping, at six point three.
- Nineteen degrees Celsius.

167
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:43,554
P.E.T. scanner ready?

168
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:44,325
<i>Ready to go!</i>

169
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:45,498
Put it up.

170
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,670
<i>What's that funny smell?</i>

171
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,646
Probably Shepherd.

172
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,512
- Cells metabolizing.
- What?

173
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:59,975
Holy shit, his cells are synthesizing D.N.A.

174
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:03,705
This is incredible, all his cells are good.

175
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:11,592
Brady, that funny smell,
sulfur and oxygen... I think.

176
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,963
- Dimethyl sulfoxide.
- Well, could be.

177
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,548
<i>Dimethyl what?</i>

178
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:34,766
Sulfoxide, DMSO, it's
a universal solvent.

179
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:38,066
You put it on your finger, it zips right through
your body, you taste it in your mouth.

180
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,989
It tastes like garlic.
It carries other molecules with it.

181
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,449
What other molecules?

182
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,201
- A cryoprotectant.
- A cryoprotectant?

183
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:52,413
It's a peptide, it's glycoprotein, it's like a... an antifreeze,
it's some substance that prevents crystallization.

184
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,014
It's why his cells are good, he was loaded with this stuff.

185
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,418
Where did it come from?

186
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,649
- Buttercups.
- Buttercups?

187
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,639
That Russian mammoth they found,
his stomach was full of buttercups.

188
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,630
This iceman, maybe it
was something he ate.

189
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:15,923
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

190
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,200
What have you got?

191
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,678
<i>Same old thing.</i>

192
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,483
What?

193
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,146
<i>Naw, it's probably a malfunction.</i>

194
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:24,602
- What's what?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

195
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,628
I'm reading something.
Shepherd, please.

196
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:32,684
- What does it look like, Maynard?
- It's sorta like slow wave activity.

197
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:40,963
God damn it, that's brain activity.
Cold call.

198
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:44,921
- E.K.G.?
- Flatline.

199
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:53,005
Okay, give me an amp of calcium, an amp
of epinephrine, 2 amps of bicarb.

200
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,783
If you think of a tube, let's get a ventilator in here.

201
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,669
- What that mean?
- Probably nothing.

202
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,575
Where's the god damned cart?

203
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:28,857
- E.E.G.
- E.K.G.

204
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,308
- Four G clear.
- Slow wave, deep cortical activity.

205
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:38,006
Mid-brain function.

206
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,123
- Who?
- Him.

207
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:43,553
- Him?
- Him.

208
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:44,423
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

209
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:50,623
- I have some calcium and epinephrine standing by.
- Twenty watts.

210
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,515
- Stand clear.
- All clear.

211
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,424
- E.K.G.?
- Still force fib.

212
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,799
Another amp, calcium and I have
to have some lidocain standing by.

213
00:22:57,904 --> 00:22:59,505
- What's happening?
- Brain activity.

214
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,567
- Ready and clear.
- All clear.

215
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:08,227
- V-tach, rate's one-seventy.
- Are you sure about that?

216
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,474
Yeah.

217
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,838
- One hundred lidocaine.
- I got one mil per minute.

218
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,796
- Give me 50 watts.
- 50 watts.

219
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,659
- Charge.
- Stand clear.

220
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:21,063
- All clear.
- Functional rhythm.

221
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,563
He's alive.

222
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,651
Amazing.

223
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,471
<i>You know, I thought he's have more hair.</i>

224
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:16,161
<i>- But he looks strong.
- Yeah, I'm sure he had to be.</i>

225
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,634
Can I have a look?

226
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:25,508
- How does he look?
- Compared to what?

227
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:30,207
Temp's normal, urine output
100 c.c.'s an hour, B.U.N. normal.

228
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:34,961
Cardiac output six liters, blood gasses
are good, 12 hours off the ventilator.

229
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,741
Higher cortical activity,
but not like ours.

230
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,561
No, more like Shepherd's.

231
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,188
- Or a premature baby.
- What do you think?

232
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:46,688
I think he might be conscious,
but I DON'T think he's going to make the Super Bowl.

233
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:57,314
- Trach.
- Clear his throat.

234
00:24:57,628 --> 00:24:59,215
- I got it.
- Valium, 10 milligrams.

235
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,245
<i>Put it in, put it in now.</i>

236
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,786
<i>Where's the respirator?</i>

237
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,552
Don't panic, everybody just take it easy.

238
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:14,101
Hands off, hands off.

239
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:17,816
Heartbeat's okay.

240
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,063
Another valium.

241
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:26,679
- What is that?
- Kill that band.

242
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:48,755
Shepherd, what the hell are you doing?

243
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,646
You're not sterile!
Do not touch him!

244
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:14,136
The electrolytes are still normal,
blood sugar is 80.

245
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,639
Might want to start him on hyper-alimentation,
avoid any chance of hypoglycemia.

246
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,706
No sign of sepsis, the blood
cultures are negative.

247
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:21,160
Will he live, will he be okay?

248
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:25,002
- Heart rate hit 200, his blood pressure peaked.
- A massive at adrenergic discharge.

249
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:28,376
- What does that mean?
- Means we scared the shit out of him.

250
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,194
Now...

251
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,329
just what does this mean to us?

252
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,169
- Well, maybe a Nobel prize.
- Maybe as big as Genentech.

253
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,318
- Maybe bigger.
- Bigger than gene splicing?

254
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,007
Immortality.

255
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,892
- Aw, come on.
- Well, extended life, greatly extended.

256
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,897
- Do you know what we're looking for?
- Cryoprotectant.

257
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:03,001
Do you know why?

258
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,486
You're going to freeze everyone with cancer
and bring them back when there's a cure.

259
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:08,410
- Yes.
- And then what're you going to do with them?

260
00:27:09,082 --> 00:27:12,321
- I don't think that's the main issue, Shepherd.
- Yeah, they won't know a living soul.

261
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:14,139
The relatives wanna spend all their money.

262
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,900
Maybe we have waves of freeze-dried
old folks living in Miami Beach?

263
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,673
Ya know, I mean, who are you kidding,
there are too many people in the world right now.

264
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,646
Death is Nature's way of
making room for someone else.

265
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:26,189
Einstein, Bertram Russell,
Einstein could have finished his theory.

266
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,224
- Aheela could've finished HIS.
- Mozart, Young, Stravinsky.

267
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:35,260
- Genghis Khan, Charlie Parker, Gandhi, Fatty Arbuckle.
- All right, so who's to live?

268
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:40,468
Everyone? And who's to decide?
The guys with the money and the power?

269
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,951
They'll stay and keep everything.
I mean, they eat better food,

270
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,199
they drive better cars, and now
they're going to live longer, too?

271
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,611
Shepherd, someday paramedics are going to
carry cryo tanks... someone's dying, you freeze him,

272
00:27:52,612 --> 00:27:56,445
you stop everything until you've got the blood,
or the surgeons, or the spare parts you need.

273
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,000
This is worth much more
than any one man, even him.

274
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:04,793
- If we were going to hurt him, which we're not...
- He's a man, not a specimen.

275
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:10,845
A forty thousand year old man who can teach us
about ourselves, tell us how we evolved.

276
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:15,980
Now that is much more important than
trying to figure-out how to preserve people.

277
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,509
I mean, he's alive,
you're forgetting that.

278
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:22,186
You can't take him apart, punch him
full of holes and drain all his fluids.

279
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:26,454
That's our best chance of keeping him alive,
we have to study him in order to save him.

280
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:29,164
- Can he be moved?
- No.

281
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,956
- Why not?
- It's not just infection, there's psychic trauma.

282
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:36,099
I don't want a lot of people up here.
If the media gets hold of this...

283
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,539
If the media gets hold of this
they'll be up here by the plane-load.

284
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,398
Yeah, run it by the Johnny Carson Show,
selling Eskimo Pies.

285
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:46,718
Now, you can't keep him sedated forever,
he's got to wake up, then what?

286
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,690
- What are you suggesting?
- What... you want to find a chemical...

287
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:53,404
find-out about the man.

288
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:57,429
I mean, we've... we've got the facilities right here.

289
00:28:57,638 --> 00:28:58,925
- What?
- The Vivarium?

290
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:01,605
- Yes.
- Ah, you're crazy, what about sterility?

291
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,172
- Wait, it's atmosphere controlled.
- What about the bears?

292
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:07,328
Screw the bears! What... you said it, Singe,
we have study him and save him.

293
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,592
<i>- And all sorts of animals have been living in there.
- That's their home.</i>

294
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:12,251
<i>- Just give me two weeks.
- We need the space.</i>

295
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:27,624
<i>Get him back there!</i>

296
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,839
Get back! Ah!

297
00:35:35,738 --> 00:35:37,992
Who the hell was it that said
my box was locked in this situation?

298
00:35:54,377 --> 00:35:56,235
- What happened?
- He found us.

299
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,349
He's out of control.
He hurts himself, I'm responsible.

300
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:41,252
No! Don't shoot him!

301
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:42,295
<i>Don't shoot.</i>

302
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:18,896
- What's going on?
- He found us.

303
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:23,005
Get a stretcher!

304
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:28,038
Hey, Maynard, call the infirmary, get a stretcher down here!

305
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,750
- Oh, God, I had to tranc him.
- You what!?

306
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:32,001
- I had to tranc him.
- Get him to the infirmary right away.

307
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,626
Just don't stand there, let's help him.

308
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:52,044
- Not exactly a raving success is it?
- What do you think you're taking him?

309
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:53,407
- To the O.R.
- Where he'll be safe.

310
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,545
It's... it's too soon to take him out.

311
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,999
- That's with you, you study him whole, they study him...
- It hasn't been two weeks yet.

312
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,848
- Moving-up the schedule a bit.
- Take advantage of the sedation.

313
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:04,298
But we need more time,
we're just getting started with him!

314
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,154
Don't argue, it's the way things are.

315
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,275
What's a matter with your game?

316
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:59,858
After what happened upstairs today,
who can concentrate, right, Shepherd?

317
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:09,104
- Dr. Brady.
- Dr. Shepherd, what do you want?

318
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:12,347
- I wanted to buy you a drink.
- Not now, Shepherd.

319
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:16,748
I wanted to see if I could unfreeze you,
check your vital signs.

320
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:18,784
Bring YOU back to life.

321
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:25,941
Shepherd, look, it's late.

322
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:32,105
You want to unfreeze me, get me to
a beach somewhere, get me someplace warm.

323
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:35,239
- What is that?
- Exhibit A.

324
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:39,355
No thanks, I've already seen "Debbie Does Dallas".

325
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:42,189
Oh, that's... that's nothing, this is much hotter than that.

326
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:52,845
<i>How does he do that?</i>

327
00:39:52,846 --> 00:39:56,841
Very easy to explain... a nerve block.

328
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:59,452
Beta-endorphins, organic morphines
produced in the brain.

329
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:04,597
Yeah, well, it's more than that, their flesh doesn't burn,
they're impervious to fire, there's no blistering, no charring.

330
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,402
Yeah, I want to show you something else.

331
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:10,092
Look.

332
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,299
Christ, Shepherd!

333
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:18,481
See, look, there's... there's no blood,
these people are producing some

334
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:22,508
chemical that protects their tissue,
prevents charring, stops bleeding.

335
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,811
<i>So, what you're saying is that
our man produced his own chemical?</i>

336
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:31,107
Yeah, yeah, right! Other life
forms have done it, your fish,

337
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:35,403
the ardachar, hibernating
animals, maybe he did it, too.

338
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:36,772
How?

339
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:42,107
I don't know how, but for whatever reason,
his body stopped producing it.

340
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:46,249
Maybe his spirit can teach us
more than his flesh.

341
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,246
<i>I'd sure like the chance to find-out.</i>

342
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,185
Okay, I've got men all around the catwalk,
we can get to you in seconds.

343
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:10,245
Yeah, no guns, though.

344
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:14,225
- Hey, wait man, but Shepherd...
- No, no matter what, no guns.

345
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:15,335
Okay, no guns.

346
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,077
- Okay.
- Yeah.

347
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:18,553
How complete are these precautions?

348
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,011
Loomis can get down to him in seconds.

349
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:03,705
- Hey, Shepherd!
- Shut up for Christ’s sake, you're makin' him nervous.

350
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,538
Chahrehl.

351
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:18,912
Chahrehl.

352
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:24,996
Chahrehl.

353
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,725
- Charl...
- Chahrehl.

354
00:45:31,183 --> 00:45:32,779
That's your name.

355
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,998
Ch... Charlie.

356
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:40,959
- Again.
- Charlie.

357
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:44,013
- Chahrehl.
- Shepherd.

358
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,185
Shepherd.

359
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:49,957
Cheh...

360
00:45:51,604 --> 00:45:55,082
- Shep.
- Sheh.

361
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:59,157
- Shep.
- Shehp-ehr.

362
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:02,296
Shep-herd.

363
00:46:02,297 --> 00:46:05,303
Shehp-ehr.

364
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,594
Shepherd.

365
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:09,829
- Shephehr.
- Right!

366
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,754
Bird.

367
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:25,569
Bieh-Tah.

368
00:46:28,197 --> 00:46:30,676
- Bieh-Tah.
- Bieh-Tah.

369
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:40,552
- Bieh-Tah.
- Yes, yes.

370
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,356
Bird.

371
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:50,191
Bird.

372
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:54,790
- Bird.
- Bee... bee.

373
00:46:57,718 --> 00:46:59,579
Beeee.

374
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:17,710
God.

375
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,619
- Chahrehl.
- Charlie.

376
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:06,547
- Shepherd.
- I'm dead? This is where I came to?

377
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:33,798
If we want to communicate with him, if we want to get
a clue to his language, that's what I mean.

378
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,718
- But, what do you mean?
- We have to identify the parameters of the language.

379
00:48:36,824 --> 00:48:40,837
<i>So, we need a linguist, like Professor Chapman,
she's the best there is.</i>

380
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,252
The osmotic movement of the
cryoprotectant through the body,

381
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,093
and more importantly, what occurs with the
place that prohibits crystallization in the cells.

382
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:53,756
- But the first time we get any hint of it in human...
- It evaporates right in front of our eyes.

383
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:11,506
Chapman? Who's that?

384
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:13,213
- From M.I.T.
- What?

385
00:49:13,214 --> 00:49:15,987
- The linguist.
- Oh, PROFESSOR Chapman.

386
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:18,499
Hello, Mabel!

387
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:23,650
<i>- Hey, what's that?
- Zaraco, the Gum god of the Zabana Tribe.</i>

388
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:27,785
Gum is very important to them, I put him
on the head of every file for good luck,

389
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:31,913
- and I don't lose half of what I use...
- We're gonna lose the picture if we're not careful here.

390
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:34,615
- A couple of twists.
- Tap! Here we go!

391
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:36,641
All righhhhhhhht.

392
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:45,430
<i>- What do you think?
- Quite the little chatterbox, isn't he?</i>

393
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:49,486
- What's he saying?
- What would you ask if you were him?

394
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,166
Where am I? Who are you? What's goin' on?

395
00:49:57,204 --> 00:50:00,652
- I think that's a fair assumption.
- It's the same things you always ask, Shepherd.

396
00:50:00,846 --> 00:50:04,148
Of course, we'll be more certain
as you two get better acquainted.

397
00:50:13,475 --> 00:50:16,360
- Rock.
- Rah.

398
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:18,924
- Rock.
- Rah.

399
00:50:55,939 --> 00:50:58,429
- But-ton.
- Buh.

400
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,449
- Button.
- Buh... buh.

401
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:11,540
- Button.
- Buh-tah.

402
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:26,264
- That's...
- Buh-tah.

403
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:27,931
Yeah, two buttons.

404
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:44,240
- Bone... bone.
- Dehr.

405
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,874
- Dehr.
- Dehr.

406
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,385
- Deh.
- Deh.

407
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:52,447
- Dehr.
- Dehr.

408
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:54,425
- Dehr.
- Dehr.

409
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:56,893
- Dehr.
- Dehr.

410
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,258
- Eat.
- Dehr.

411
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:25,013
He's as basic and direct as you, Maynard.
Only he seems to have quite a vocabulary.

00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:19,017
It's too long, it should be cold now.

451
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,485
<i>How much further can we go?</i>

452
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:22,654
Not much.

453
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:24,271
Not if you wanna keep him alive.

454
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,604
<i>Cryo negative.</i>

455
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:27,769
Your killing him!

456
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:28,670
How's his heart?

457
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,714
<i>It's cold... it's cold.</i>

458
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:31,005
<i>Hold it there.</i>

459
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,503
There're no signs, Brady.

460
00:57:32,504 --> 00:57:33,748
Twenty-five.

461
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,548
Not exactly a raging success, is it?

462
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:37,977
<i>Heart rate still decreasing rapidly.</i>

463
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,885
Shep-ehr.

464
00:57:57,134 --> 00:57:58,647
Shep-ehr.

465
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:08,446
I didn't do it!

466
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,272
<i>Shep-ehr!</i>

467
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:29,934
No!

468
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:32,684
No!

469
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,221
Shep-ehr.

470
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:43,138
No!

471
00:58:50,202 --> 00:58:51,176
No!!!

472
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,399
Shep-ehr!!

473
00:59:53,862 --> 00:59:55,221
<i>Brady.</i>

474
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,233
- Need to talk to talk to you, can I come in?
- Right now?

475
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:11,552
- Not a good time?
- Shepherd, not more tapes!

476
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:16,066
I need your help... with Charlie.

477
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:21,554
- You're the anthropologist, not me.
- You're human, aren’t' you, aren't you curious?

478
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,054
It's not exactly my field,
he's a primitive, it's your job.

479
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:29,282
It's your job, too, this
isn't just a medical experiment.

480
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:33,821
You're alienating him, we're losing contact.
You're making it impossible for me to deal with him.

481
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:36,473
Because every time you POKE something into him,
you take the LIFE right out of him.

482
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:41,423
Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd, Doctor Stanley Shepherd,
wunderkind anthropologist.

483
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:46,784
THE Stanley Shepherd, who did a year of field work
with the Malasay Tribe, to study their natural state?

484
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:51,227
Two months later they're showing up in
Pittsburgh Steeler tee-shirts and playing with butane lighters.

485
01:00:51,573 --> 01:00:52,427
That Stanley Shepherd?

486
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:58,458
All right, all right, it's my first assignment, I'm young,
I screwed-up once, I won't let it happen again.

487
01:00:58,459 --> 01:01:01,198
Yes you will, so will I, we all do.

488
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:05,933
I'm probably making every mistake there is.

489
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:09,126
I've never done this before, and nobody has.

490
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:14,877
I can't stop the medical research, I wouldn't if I could.

491
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,717
You've got everything you need.

492
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:18,788
<i>But I... I need you.</i>

493
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:20,647
You can't have me, I'm dead tired.

494
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:24,438
No, I need you to come in there
with me, to see him, to be with him.

495
01:01:24,987 --> 01:01:27,245
What do you want me to do, play Jane to your Tarzan?

496
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:32,960
I've got enough trouble coping with everything as it is.
Shepherd, do you realize...

497
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:37,671
if Singe really wanted to, he could get this
whole thing stopped dead, that's my problem.

498
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:40,738
Charlie's inner life, for the moment, is yours.

499
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:44,621
He's not a problem, he's a man,
maybe that's what you're having trouble with.

500
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,751
I think maybe you better go.

501
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,934
Look, I did... I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

502
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,248
I... I... I don't know what I mean.

503
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:02,468
I mean he's not like you or me, but he IS a man.

504
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:08,155
And contact with a woman, it just might bring him
out of himself, might lead to something, something NEW.

505
01:02:29,188 --> 01:02:31,376
<i>Shepherd.
Shepherd.</i>

506
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,521
What, what.

507
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:34,478
<i>The door, Shepherd.</i>

508
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:03,259
You know, Shepherd, I got stepped-on
by a pony when I was six.

509
01:03:03,976 --> 01:03:06,024
I promise I won't let him step on ya.

510
01:03:09,255 --> 01:03:11,584
- Is it all right?
- Yeah, it's okay.

511
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,359
Well, it smells terrible.

512
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,314
All right.

513
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:41,423
It's okay, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine.

514
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,319
- Just in the cave, you'll find...
- What!?

515
01:03:46,486 --> 01:03:47,741
<i>The he is.</i>

516
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:55,097
Steady.
Take it easy.

517
01:04:06,464 --> 01:04:10,727
Relax, relax, relax,
it's all right.

518
01:04:10,728 --> 01:04:12,849
Put your hand up where he can see it.

519
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,073
- You sure?
- Yeah.

520
01:04:14,074 --> 01:04:15,489
Shep-ehr?

521
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:24,515
It's okay, all right, all right, all right.

522
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,511
Let him look at you,
let him look at you.

523
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,287
It's all right, it's all right,
he smells fear.

524
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:49,220
He smells you.

525
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:55,952
- What's that.?
- That's lunch.

526
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:01,302
- What do we do now?
- Eat it.

527
01:05:01,303 --> 01:05:03,208
That's what I was afraid of.

528
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:06,762
- It's kinda like popcorn, you get used to it.
- Oh, my God.

529
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:10,308
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

530
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,063
- What was it?
- It was a beetle.

531
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:13,550
- What did it taste like?
- A beetle.

532
01:05:13,969 --> 01:05:17,565
- I think I'm going to throw-up.
- No, don't throw-up, he'll take it as a bad omen.

533
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:30,208
Let him look at you.

534
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:34,101
Let him look at you, it's okay.

535
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:37,692
<i>Let him look, let him look,
just go with it, go with it.</i>

536
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:40,020
<i>Relax, he's never seen anything like this.</i>

537
01:05:58,603 --> 01:06:00,429
He can smell the fear, it's all right.

538
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:07,054
It's all right, it's okay.

539
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:14,684
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Pah-eee!

540
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:17,632
- Pah-eee.
- Pah-eee!

541
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:25,067
Pah-eee.
Mine! Mine!

542
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:40,038
Sorry, he left, everything...
everything's under control here.

543
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,722
- Very encouraging.
- You're okay.

544
01:06:51,412 --> 01:06:55,538
- What is that?
- I think he made me an offer.

545
01:06:57,015 --> 01:06:58,848
- For what?
- For you.

546
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,160
- Tell him it's not enough.
- No, no.

547
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:11,783
Pah-eee, mine, no, mine, no.

548
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,008
No, Charlie.

549
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:10,131
- That looks like a match.
- Yeah, but what is that? Woman?

550
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:14,570
- Something like it, sounds the same.
- Yeah, it all sounds the same.

551
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:18,669
<i>But it is a different pitch.</i>

552
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:22,966
Thought he had a certain grasp of things,
if only he could ascertain sentences.

553
01:08:23,071 --> 01:08:24,699
That's easy for you to say.

554
01:08:44,694 --> 01:08:45,970
<i>That's quite a woman.</i>

555
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:48,810
<i>She's in very good shape.</i>

556
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:14,231
<i>- Children?
- Yeah.</i>

557
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:17,995
- He's talkin' about his family.
- Well, that's a likely guess.

558
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:11,454
He wants to know where his children are.

559
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:33,368
How could anybody be so stupid?

560
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,390
- Bieh-Tah.
- Charlie, no!

561
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:42,234
Bieh-Tah.

562
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,241
Bieh-Tah.

563
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:57,387
Bieh-Tah.

564
01:10:57,388 --> 01:10:58,932
Get that chopper out of here.

565
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,881
<i>Get that helicopter out of here.</i>

566
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:07,938
Bieh-Tah.

567
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,801
Bieh-Tah.

568
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:15,915
Get it out of here...
now!

569
01:11:26,537 --> 01:11:27,966
Bieh-Tah!

570
01:11:28,696 --> 01:11:30,495
<i>Bieh-Tah.</i>

571
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,522
Bieh-Tah.

572
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,490
Bieh-Tah.

573
01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:43,941
Seih-Kah.

574
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:45,961
Seih-Kah.

575
01:11:46,379 --> 01:11:48,746
Bieh-Tah.

576
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:50,981
Bieh-Tah.

577
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:23,047
- Saeh-Kah.
- Saeh-Nah?

578
01:13:23,084 --> 01:13:24,325
Saeh-Kah.

579
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:25,878
<i>Seht-Nah!</i>

580
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,441
Seht-Nah.

581
01:13:32,596 --> 01:13:37,125
That word with the chopper, it's two words.
Bieh-Tah is his word, Saeh-Kah's the translation.

582
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:41,430
But it's not Saeh-Kah, it's Seht-Nah,
and that's why he was so mad.

583
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:43,852
There's an Eskimo myth,
close to one of his.

584
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:46,009
Wait a minute, Shepherd, you're
telling me that the helicopter...

585
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,939
...is the Bird, the Messenger of the Gods,
but also a trickster.

586
01:13:50,148 --> 01:13:52,744
It's supposed to take you to
heaven, but if you've done wrong,

587
01:13:52,745 --> 01:13:55,444
it takes you someplace else where
you're judged for your sins.

588
01:13:55,654 --> 01:13:58,070
- What sins?
- He let his people die.

589
01:13:58,071 --> 01:14:00,177
- He what?
- I know Charlie, I know him.

590
01:14:00,178 --> 01:14:03,529
I mean, what was he doing out there,
maybe even a magnetic pole flip,

591
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:08,133
food ran low, no food, no game,
people faced with starvation?

592
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,811
The animals left them to starve, it was because
they offended their Gods in some way.

593
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:16,732
- This guy was on a dreamwalk.
- A what!?

594
01:14:17,016 --> 01:14:24,614
A dreamwalk. He went out to find this spirit,
to offer himself for return of the animals.

595
01:14:24,615 --> 01:14:28,338
- And that's the Bird?
- The Messenger, the Trickster.

596
01:14:33,255 --> 01:14:37,203
And now that he's seen it, he won't think
of anything else, that's his God.

597
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,718
How long has it been?

598
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,191
Thirty-four hours.

599
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:18,602
Twelve hours of that weird chanting, and...

600
01:15:20,053 --> 01:15:21,995
now this.

601
01:16:01,033 --> 01:16:02,420
I don't know what to do.

602
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:05,847
Shepherd, we've got
to be able do something for him.

603
01:16:10,534 --> 01:16:12,924
<i>Shepherd, isn't there
anything we can do for him?</i>

604
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:15,316
<i>Shepherd, there's got to
be something we can do for him.</i>

605
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:17,325
<i>Shepherd!!</i>

606
01:18:22,132 --> 01:18:26,199
<i>Maintenance, report to loading dock.
Maintenance, report to loading dock.</i>

607
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,769
- What's the problem?
- What's the problem? This is my problem.

608
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,794
It's this machine, I told you before but...

609
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:26,327
All right, that's all it takes.

610
01:21:35,243 --> 01:21:36,285
<i>Any other problems?</i>

611
01:21:36,302 --> 01:21:37,777
Just one other thing.

612
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:38,744
All right.

613
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:16,572
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Good observation.

614
01:22:17,764 --> 01:22:20,544
Don't you ever do anything NOW, Maynard?

615
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:25,599
Don't I ever do anything now, MAYNARD?

616
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:47,974
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

617
01:22:48,183 --> 01:22:49,866
Shepherd!

618
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:54,673
Sheh-ehr.

619
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:46,487
Bieh-Tah!

620
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:40,276
Bieh-Tah!

621
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:42,492
Seih-Kah.

622
01:24:43,982 --> 01:24:45,692
Bieh-Tah.

623
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,835
Get that thing out of here!

624
01:25:29,299 --> 01:25:32,906
No broken bones.
No apparent head injuries.

625
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:34,188
Oh, good.

626
01:25:35,822 --> 01:25:39,417
- So, at least our iceman's okay.
- What about Maynard?

627
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:45,904
Well, the Company's got its lease, you medicos got
a live body, and you... you've got your monkey.

628
01:25:46,218 --> 01:25:51,697
Shut-up!! If you think I'm gonna call it
an industrial accident, you're crazy.

629
01:25:52,258 --> 01:25:56,124
<i>He's not a monkey, he's a human being... like us.</i>

630
01:25:56,855 --> 01:26:01,452
Well, not QUITE like us, we've undergone
a few changes in forty thousand years.

631
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:05,299
- Not exactly for the better.
- For once we agree on something.

632
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,341
Well, what's that?

633
01:26:06,913 --> 01:26:10,319
Our opinion of modern civilization.
But what I would like to know

634
01:26:10,528 --> 01:26:14,684
is how you expect him to survive in it,
which he will have to do eventually.

635
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:16,895
What, you think we're going to set him
out on the street tomorrow?

636
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:19,530
What ARE you going to do?
I mean, how are you going to protect him?

637
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:22,827
Shepherd, what's happened here is nothing
compared to what's going to happen to him out there.

638
01:26:22,932 --> 01:26:25,061
Okay! That's it! Not another word!

639
01:26:26,275 --> 01:26:27,907
It's over.

640
01:26:30,305 --> 01:26:31,962
Nice try.

641
01:26:33,205 --> 01:26:34,826
But it's over.

642
01:26:44,036 --> 01:26:46,874
<i>What the HELL is he doing back in the Vivarium?
It's not secure!</i>

643
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:51,603
<i>It's been taken care of,
he's under constant surveillance... now.</i>

644
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:58,876
We'll stabilize him.
We'll get him on a plane.

645
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:05,016
We were greedy.

646
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,746
I was an idiot.

647
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,950
<i>Think someone else coulda done better?</i>

648
01:27:14,134 --> 01:27:16,193
There's nothing more I can do, Shepherd.

649
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:25,681
This guy was on a dreamwalk when we found him.

650
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:28,109
Let him finish it.

651
01:27:28,865 --> 01:27:31,370
<i>All he can teach us,
you want to waste it.</i>

652
01:27:34,075 --> 01:27:36,888
You can't keep him in the cage the rest of his life.

653
01:27:39,942 --> 01:27:41,106
It's life.

654
01:27:44,428 --> 01:27:46,369
It's not, for him.

655
01:27:48,367 --> 01:27:49,673
He'll die.

656
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:56,325
None of us want that,
believe me, Shepherd.

657
01:28:25,124 --> 01:28:26,892
What the hell are YOU doing, Shepherd?

658
01:28:28,809 --> 01:28:29,881
What do you want?

659
01:28:30,466 --> 01:28:31,957
He wants your HELP.

660
01:28:32,438 --> 01:28:33,500
Right?

661
01:28:44,038 --> 01:28:45,153
Can't help ya.

662
01:28:49,111 --> 01:28:50,715
Maybe we should go and we CAN help him.

663
01:28:52,687 --> 01:28:53,655
How?

664
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,399
The door.

665
01:29:09,352 --> 01:29:10,719
<i>Charlie!</i>

666
01:29:12,309 --> 01:29:13,264
<i>Charlie!</i>

667
01:29:32,897 --> 01:29:35,076
Sheh-ehr.

668
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,271
Let's go... Charlie.

669
01:29:46,218 --> 01:29:47,177
Let's go.

670
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:13,304
<i>Powell, I stopped at the south face.</i>

671
01:32:13,305 --> 01:32:14,637
Do you see anything?

672
01:32:14,638 --> 01:32:15,605
<i>We found tracks.</i>

673
01:32:15,606 --> 01:32:16,993
Do you see Johnson above you?

674
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:46,017
Charlie!

675
01:33:52,876 --> 01:33:56,750
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

676
01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:09,833
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

677
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:14,336
Charlie! Charlie!

678
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:01,866
Bieh-Tah.

679
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,714
Bieh-Tah!

680
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:29,243
Bieh-Tah.

681
01:35:47,962 --> 01:35:49,984
Bieh-Tah.

682
01:35:55,106 --> 01:35:56,645
Seih-Kah.

683
01:36:34,462 --> 01:36:35,441
Charlie.

684
01:36:39,031 --> 01:36:39,864
Charlie.
