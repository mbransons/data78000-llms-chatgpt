1
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:31,363
Yeah.

2
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:33,404
Mrs. Carlin's called four times.

3
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,906
Her husband's two months late
with her child support again.

4
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:37,771
And your 10:00 just walked in.

5
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:42,645
Tell Mrs. Carlin I'll get back to her,
and show Miss Brodsky in.

6
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,273
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,311
Hi.

8
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,149
Come on in. Have a seat.

9
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:53,725
Well, I've thought a lot
about your situation,

10
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:55,659
and I've decided to take your case.

11
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,658
And based on what you've told me,
I think we can win.

12
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:06,763
I just want you to be sure
you know what you're getting into.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,972
Divorce is a big adjustment
for anybody to make.

14
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,039
Now, you've been together
almost 10 years.

15
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,882
That's an awful long time
to share a life with someone.

16
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:20,149
So I just want you to be certain

17
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:23,487
that you're ready to throw it all away

18
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,892
and be out there on your own.

19
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,291
I'm ready, Mr. Hanner.

20
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,859
I want to divorce my parents.

21
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:35,529
Free Casey Brodsky!

22
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,073
Tom, I'm standing in front of
the Superior Court building

23
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,438
at downtown Los Angeles,

24
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,603
where an anxious crowd
is awaiting the arrival

25
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,010
of the Brodsky family

26
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,673
for the opening day of testimony

27
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,479
in this unprecedented
child emancipation case.

28
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:50,146
Casey Brodsky, a fourth grade student

29
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,587
at Mann Elementary School
in West Los Angeles,

30
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,386
is attempting to divorce her parents,

31
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:57,327
Lucy Van Patten Brodsky
and Albert Brodsky.

32
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:00,229
While Casey is not the first child
in this state to seek a divorce,

33
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,926
she definitely is the youngest.

34
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,902
Divorcing one's parents
is legally referred to

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,029
as the Emancipation of Minors Act.

36
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,869
Now basically, this act says

37
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,842
that any minor in the State of California

38
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,674
can be divorced from his or her parents

39
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,011
if that minor can prove
that the emancipation

40
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,413
is in their own best interest.

41
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:21,181
And that, of course,
is what this trial is all about.

42
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,621
Ms. Brodsky, is it true you were served
your daughter's divorce papers

43
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,058
while appearing on The Merv Griffin Show?

44
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:27,823
Ms. Brodsky, how do you feel
about your daughter

45
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,625
asking the court to appoint
your housekeeper

46
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:30,790
as her legal guardian?

47
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:31,958
Can I have your autograph?

48
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,661
Your book changed my life.

49
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:37,034
Hey, that's a great purse there, Lucy.
Where'd you get that?

50
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,666
Ms. Brodsky, is it true
your daughter's asking you for alimony?

51
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,210
Hey, Brodsky!

52
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,870
That, of course, was
the plaintiffs mother

53
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,470
and the codefendant in this case,

54
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:47,516
novelist Lucy Van Patten Brodsky.

55
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,914
Now the proceedings
are about to begin

56
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,418
here at the county courthouse.

57
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:53,944
However, we are awaiting the arrival
of the plaintiffs father,

58
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:55,456
film director Albert Brodsky.

59
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,125
Mr. Brodsky?

60
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,224
Hi. I'm Alan Sclusa
from the Salkin office.

61
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,768
I'm gonna be
representing you on this case.

62
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:08,304
- Where's Salkin?
- Mr. Salkin can't be here.

63
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,670
He's gonna be busy all week.

64
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,266
Wait. He's not coming at all?

65
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,435
He's been my lawyer for ten years.

66
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,808
What? Suddenly I'm not
big enough for him?

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,676
Oh, shit.

68
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,763
Mom, Dad.

69
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:41,664
Casey.

70
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,404
- Casey, come here.
- Casey, I want to talk to you.

71
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,538
Why haven't you
returned my phone calls?

72
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:49,412
My lawyer advised me
not to speak to you.

73
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,351
Your lawyer?
This whole thing is so crazy.

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,251
You are 8 years old.
What are you doing?

75
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,017
I am 9.

76
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,753
Can you hold still for just a minute?

77
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:02,456
I'm sorry that you overheard
your father and I fighting that day.

78
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,362
We shouldn't have involved you, I know.

79
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,628
But dragging us into court--

80
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,533
I mean, suddenly we're a media event.

81
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,232
Mother, you and Dad for a long time

82
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:14,276
did not recognize my rights
as a human being.

83
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,335
You both treat me like chattel.

84
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:19,210
You cannot do with me
as you please anymore.

85
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:20,214
We have irreconcilable differences.

86
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:24,379
Oh, my God. She's been brainwashed.

87
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:25,853
Are you gonna say anything?

88
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,355
Casey, are you doing this
because your mother's

89
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:28,685
been so insensitive to you?

90
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,693
Do you know how not be a worm?

91
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,924
Casey.

92
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:37,229
I understand why you want
to divorce your father.

93
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,235
I know you never got over
his abandoning us.

94
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:42,670
No, Mom, you never
got over his abandoning us.

95
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,298
Let's not blame this whole thing on me.

96
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,638
All Casey needs is a little love

97
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,678
from a parent who's
not too busy to do it.

98
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,044
And what do you know about love?

99
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,446
I'm human being, too, you know.

100
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:53,040
Since when?

101
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,245
Casey.

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,083
Casey, honey, wait. Wait.

103
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,315
Listen.

104
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,122
Whatever we did to you,
we did by accident.

105
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,322
We're your parents. Stop this insanity.

106
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:05,797
Come on, don't make us go in there.

107
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:08,926
What do you say? Huh, pal?

108
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,599
Do you swear to tell the truth,

109
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,072
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

110
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,335
so help you God?

111
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,708
- I do.
- Please be seated.

112
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:22,375
Mr. Brodsky, where were you born?

113
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,284
Plainfield, New Jersey.

114
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:29,050
You grew up in Plainfield?
Went to school there?

115
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:31,820
Yes. And then I went on
to New York University.

116
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,658
And what brought you to California?

117
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,198
A job.

118
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,393
I got my doctorate in Cinema at NYU.

119
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,595
And my thesis,
Themeological Analysis

120
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,195
of the Sexual Overtones
in the Early Films of Ernst Lubitsch,

121
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:48,438
was published, and I was subsequently
offered a professorship at UCLA.

122
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:51,912
Is that where you met
Ms. Van Patten Brodsky?

123
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,576
No. I met her before I came to L.A.

124
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:58,246
On the way out, actually.

125
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:02,622
I had two weeks to kill
before classes began.

126
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,126
I thought it would be
exciting and romantic

127
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:05,856
to hitchhike across the country.

128
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,749
Excuse me.
Can we stop for a minute?

129
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,020
Is this really relevant
to my daughter's problem?

130
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,585
Finding out what led you
to this courtroom

131
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,030
is exactly your daughter's problem.

132
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,191
Please continue.

133
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,498
When did you say you met
Ms. Van Patten Brodsky?

134
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,909
Oh. Sorry.

135
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,944
I met Lucy in Harmony, lndiana,

136
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,483
on January 20, 1973.

137
00:06:56,551 --> 00:07:00,146
I had no idea I'd be
married to her four days later.

138
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,981
Call out my name

139
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,019
And you know wherever I am--

140
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:11,496
Hi.

141
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,589
Remember me?

142
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,259
I-- I was wondering,

143
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:19,465
would it be possible for you
to give me a lift into St. Louis?

144
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,635
Or actually any small town
that's got an airport.

145
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,737
I've decided to hang up the old thumb.

146
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:29,682
I mean, it's taken me six days
to get through 3 1/2 states.

147
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,710
Obviously, hitchhiking is not my forte.

148
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,953
I'm sure you must have your reservations

149
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:40,393
about picking up strangers, but--

150
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,624
Do you speak English?

151
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,825
Excuse me, buddy.

152
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,425
Thank you very much.

153
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:48,629
Wait. Wait, Miss, please.
I'm freezing to death.

154
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:51,036
I'm frozen. I can't stay out
here anymore.

155
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:53,839
Won't you do me this one favor?
Look. Look at this.

156
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:58,315
I have lD. I'd show you my license,
but I don't drive.

157
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,841
Listen, I have a library card.
Look. Here's a picture.

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,751
I'm a teacher. You can't
get any safer than that.

159
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:07,053
Ah, come on.
Look, I'll sit in the back.

160
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,788
I won't make a sound.
It's starting to rain.

161
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,193
Could you give me a break here?

162
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:14,164
Let me in! Please! God, please!

163
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:18,169
Lady! I'll pay you!

164
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,594
I'll only take you
as far as the next town.

165
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,225
Thank you very much
for changing your mind.

166
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,080
I didn't pick you up before
because this car doesn't belong to me.

167
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:02,241
It belongs to my fiancée, Bink,
and he has this thing--

168
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:04,114
- Bink?
- Well, his name is Dennis Brinkerhoff,

169
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,517
but everybody calls him Bink.

170
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,452
He's great, but he has
this thing about his car--

171
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,220
no food or hitchhikers allowed.

172
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:11,022
He actually had a sign
in here that said that,

173
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,323
but it kept falling down.

174
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,057
Anyway, when you said
you were a teacher,

175
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,122
- I figured--
- Bink likes teachers?

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,727
Uh, yeah. Sure.

177
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,407
- What do you do?
- Who?

178
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,841
- You.
- Me?

179
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,846
Um, nothing. I'm just engaged.

180
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:31,576
Oh. When are you getting married?

181
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,676
Actually, I write children's stories,

182
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,983
but I don't do it for a living yet.

183
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,784
I probably never will.
February 14th.

184
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:42,794
The 8th. The 14th. The 11th.

185
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,332
We're getting--

186
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,369
We're getting married in San Diego.

187
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:52,700
Bink's stationed there.
He's in the Navy.

188
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,205
I'm bringing him out his car

189
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:57,209
and I'm bringing him out me,
all at the same time.

190
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:00,212
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

191
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,306
No. Neither do l.
So what do you teach?

192
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:07,012
- Film.
- Oh. Really? Wow.

193
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,214
God, we didn't even have
a film department at my school.

194
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,520
We didn't have anything
at my school.

195
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:12,855
I went to Chatham.

196
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,121
That's an all-girls' school in Pittsburgh.

197
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,526
I'm from Pittsburgh,
so don't make any jokes.

198
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:17,292
I happen to love it there.

199
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:22,133
So, um, how do you
teach film anyway?

200
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,968
That's all right. It doesn't matter.

201
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,729
Let's go trucking, baby.

202
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,394
I don't truck. Thank you. Please.

203
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,735
- Come on--
- Please. Please.

204
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:58,901
Honey, the twins just threw up
all over your grandmother.

205
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:00,569
Oh, good.

206
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,507
- Thanks.
- No problem.

207
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,609
How you doing?

208
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,177
Oh, I like your belt.

209
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:17,663
Themeological Analysis
of Sexual Overtones

210
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,392
in the Early Films of Ernst Lubitsch?

211
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:21,524
What does that mean?

212
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,627
MGM, circa 1934, The Merry Widow.

213
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,399
We're in the bedroom of King Achmed

214
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:28,407
and his beautiful young wife Delores.

215
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,636
Now, King Achmed was played
by George Barbier.

216
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:34,442
He was a 65-year-old,
very rotund actor.

217
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,415
Well, he was getting dressed to go out.

218
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,610
Finally he finishes,
he walks out the door,

219
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:41,348
and there is a very young,
handsome captain of the guard.

220
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:43,858
Salutes him with a sword
and clicks his heels.

221
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:46,861
Maurice Chevalier. Dashing.

222
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,898
And the captain of the guards
watches him walk down the hall

223
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,193
and disappear around the corner,

224
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,791
and then he slips into
the bedroom with the queen.

225
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,671
All right? Now, meanwhile,
the king, he's walking along

226
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,231
and he looks down, he doesn't have his belt,
he doesn't have his sword.

227
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,674
He's gonna have to go back.

228
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,974
So the camera pans back with him

229
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,310
down the hallway, to the doors,

230
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,610
but stops at the door.

231
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,277
He goes in, the camera stays
on the closed doors, right?

232
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,081
Beat. Beat. What's going to happen?

233
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:12,451
Suddenly the doors fling open,

234
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:14,046
and it's him, it's the king.

235
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,389
He's fine. He walks out.

236
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,725
He's got his belt and his sword,
and he's putting them on.

237
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,390
Only this time, they don't fit.
They're too small.

238
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,836
The Lubitsch touch.

239
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,240
Well, that'll be all for today, class.

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,610
It must be great to be so passionate
about something.

241
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,016
I'll bet you're a wonderful teacher.

242
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,889
Oh, lllinois.

243
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,290
Bink made up these tapes for me.

244
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,419
Travel tapes. One for each state.

245
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,259
They're really quite helpful.

246
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,593
Welcome to lllinois.

247
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,259
How you doing, Peanuthead?

248
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,632
He thinks I have a small head.

249
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,728
Before we get too far
into The Prairie State,

250
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,238
better check your gas gauge.

251
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,367
She's probably down
to less than half a tank.

252
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,208
You'll find an Esso station
on the north side of the highway

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,408
at approximately 2300 hours,
if you're still on course.

254
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:11,941
Booked you a room in my name
at the Ho Jo's in Culver.

255
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,682
By the way, an ex-roomie
of mine from Annapolis,

256
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:17,225
Kip Harwood, lives in Culver.

257
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,920
Kip's a super guy.

258
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,792
Give him a jingle if you need anything.

259
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:23,832
Area code 217--
ah, you're right there.

260
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,891
You don't need the area code.
Look alive, Bink.

261
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,732
Okay.

262
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:32,503
His number's 555-7623.

263
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:34,476
And his wife's name is Corky.

264
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:35,807
Hell of a nice gal.

265
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,403
And, Luce, if they invite you over,

266
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,880
take them something, will you?

267
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,975
Spend up to 15 bucks.
Nah, make that 10.

268
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,452
We weren't that close, for Christ's sakes.

269
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,648
Only 11 more days till our wedding.

270
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,158
You know the Binker loves ya.

271
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:51,786
That was Bink.

272
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,956
- He sounded, um...
- I know. I know.

273
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:58,332
He's very--
Oh, what's the word? Um...

274
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,496
Uh, domineering?

275
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:03,133
I could tell you thought that.

276
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,643
No. You don't know him.
He's not domineering at all.

277
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:08,578
He's, um-- He likes things
a certain way, you know?

278
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,638
When you set the table for him,

279
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:12,843
he likes to line up
the bottoms of the knife

280
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:14,818
and the fork and the spoon perfectly.

281
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,824
He's-- He's very--

282
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:18,984
Compulsive.

283
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,085
Excuse me,

284
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:23,824
but I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

285
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:27,595
No. No. I can't wait
until we get married.

286
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,262
I've wanted to be a bride all my life!

287
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:33,866
I've got my veil and my gown
in the trunk--

288
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,705
Are you all right?

289
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:38,970
I'm fine. I'm fine.

290
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:43,450
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to put the Bink down.

291
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:45,383
He sounds like a terrific guy.
Really, he does.

292
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:47,217
Yes, he is. Everybody likes him.

293
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,449
He's great.

294
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:50,992
I mean, he knew lllinois
was The Prairie State.

295
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,857
He's in the Navy, serving his country.

296
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,532
Maybe I better get out here.

297
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,069
No, no. No. No. Wait. Wait, wait.

298
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:04,198
This is not your fault.
It's not your fault.

299
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,867
- It isn't?
- No.

300
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:14,108
I do this all the time.

301
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:19,717
Okay, okay. It's fine.

302
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,498
Gosh, it was really nice meeting you.

303
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,332
I wish you all the luck in the world.

304
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,531
- Thank you.
- I mean that.

305
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:36,075
Yeah, well,

306
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,338
I'm sorry about that
little outburst before.

307
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:41,438
I've been a little nervous lately.

308
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:42,641
Everybody goes through that

309
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:43,978
right before
they get married, you know?

310
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,814
It's happened to all my friends.

311
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:48,150
Also, I'm a little pooped
from the drive.

312
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,552
I don't like road trips that much.

313
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:53,151
But I was the only one
Bink trusted with his car.

314
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,525
I just didn't want you to think
I was a nut or anything.

315
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,690
No, no. It's just--

316
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,427
I don't think I should get into it.

317
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,968
What? Get into it.

318
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,768
Well, don't take this the wrong way.

319
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,538
but if you saw somebody
talking about how excited

320
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,839
they were to get married

321
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,575
and broke into tears
when they were telling you,

322
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,583
you'd just think it was
a little fishy, that's all.

323
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,153
Do you have a girlfriend, Albert?

324
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:23,158
No. No. Not at the moment.

325
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,626
You have a lot of opinions
for a guy who never had a girl.

326
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,060
I didn't say I nev--

327
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,098
I knew I shouldn't
have said anything.

328
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,690
Good-bye.
Thanks again for the lift.

329
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,838
Good luck in Hollywood.

330
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:44,505
Would you hate it a lot

331
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:47,551
if I gave you a ride
all the way to California?

332
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,348
Arm in Arm. That's the title.

333
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,217
You're sure you never read
any of these to Bink?

334
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:27,784
"Two octopuses got married

335
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,523
"and walked down the aisle

336
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,725
"arm in arm in arm in arm in arm in arm

337
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,496
in arm in arm in arm in arm--"

338
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:39,172
No, no, no. I liked it. Keep going.

339
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,141
- Really?
- Yeah.

340
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,577
Here's a good one.

341
00:18:52,655 --> 00:18:55,090
You have to picture a blank page.

342
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:57,718
- Okay?
- Okay.

343
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:00,126
And under it is written:

344
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:04,759
"No worm, no bird,

345
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:09,274
"no cat, no dog,
no person, no house,

346
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:12,572
"no tree, no woods,
no land, no water,

347
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:15,272
"no clouds, no sky, no sun,

348
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:16,871
"nothing.

349
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,610
No picture."

350
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:23,450
That was fabulous. I love you.

351
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:25,821
I mean I love them.

352
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,154
It's excellent. Excellent.

353
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:30,595
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

354
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:31,994
I think you could get these published.

355
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,733
Oh. Don't-- Don't start crying again.

356
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,036
Oh, Albert.

357
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,380
Why don't you read me another one?

358
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,814
- Well, okay.
- Please.

359
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:50,942
Yeah. Good.

360
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:26,218
Wait a minute! No, no, no, no!

361
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,720
- You can't do this to me!
- Stop! Wait!

362
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,154
- No, no, no!
- Stop!

363
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:32,216
- No, no, no, no!
- God, everything I own is in that car!

364
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,989
All my John Ford notes!

365
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,622
My lucky typewriter! Everything!

366
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:38,461
- Are you crazy?
- What?

367
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,525
Who cares about your stupid stuff?

368
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:44,938
Bink's car has been stolen.

369
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,968
The car he worked nine straight summers
mowing lawns to buy.

370
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:52,209
The car he trusted me
to bring out to him!

371
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:54,183
- Well, wait a minute--
- Wait a minute!

372
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,446
If you hadn't talked me into deviating

373
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,886
from Bink's safe plan,
that car would still be here.

374
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:00,584
This is not my fault.

375
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,092
Fine.

376
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,855
Tell Bink that.

377
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:07,762
Yeah. Tell him that I was getting drunk
on margaritas with a hippie

378
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,424
while his car was being stolen.

379
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:12,959
Tell all 245 pounds of him, fella.

380
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,030
Well, I'm not a hippie!

381
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,747
Oh! He'll never talk to me again!

382
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,874
You don't know this guy.

383
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,713
I had to prove myself for weeks

384
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:30,188
so that he'd let me drive his idiotic car!

385
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:33,658
What am I going to do?

386
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,957
Tell him you misplaced it.

387
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:44,804
You're really stupid, you know that?

388
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,999
I bet you don't talk to Bink this way.

389
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,509
I don't have to.
He doesn't screw anything up.

390
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,704
You know, I refuse
to take the blame for this.

391
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,474
- Forget it!
- I'd like to forget you.

392
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,415
- How's that?
- Fine.

393
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:58,042
Fine.

394
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,426
You really bug me sometimes.

395
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:44,257
Is it possible
we only met three days ago?

396
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,497
Impossible.

397
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:55,510
Why is it you don't have a girlfriend
at the moment?

398
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,014
I don't know.

399
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:01,520
I was never very comfortable
around women.

400
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:05,024
You seem to be
pretty comfortable with me.

401
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,496
What do you see in me anyway?

402
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:17,560
I see in you exactly
what Jimmy Stewart saw

403
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,574
in Jean Arthur.

404
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:20,666
In?

405
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:23,234
In Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.

406
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:25,678
Did they end up together?

407
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,920
I'd like to see that sometime.

408
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:56,403
Well, he knows
if she's got the painting,

409
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,971
she's the woman in the wheelchair.

410
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,785
He sees the painting.

411
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,387
I understand the parts
when they're not talking.

412
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:27,871
She says,

413
00:25:27,947 --> 00:25:30,541
"lf you can paint, I can walk."

414
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,459
Keep the meter running.

415
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:41,826
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

416
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:43,330
I'm looking for Lucy Van Patten.

417
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,025
She's about yea high.
She's got blonde hair.

418
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:49,135
That's the best movie I ever saw.

419
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,641
Who's that?

420
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,540
The guy from the coffee shop.

421
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,272
I ordered us some breakfast.

422
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,109
You know,

423
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,810
great sex always...

424
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:06,287
always makes me hungry, darling.

425
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,380
Lucy!

426
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:10,483
It's Bink!

427
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:11,619
Open this door!

428
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,185
Lucy, open this door right now!

429
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:14,423
What's he doing here?

430
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:16,227
I had to call him about his car!

431
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,665
I said, "Great sex makes me hungry"

432
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:18,894
right in front of him!

433
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:20,266
He wouldn't even touch me, nothing.

434
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,999
- I'm supposed to be a virgin.
- You are?

435
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,438
I'm going to be sick.

436
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:24,941
I'll handle this.

437
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,705
Lucy, what's going on in there?

438
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,872
Albert, remember,

439
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:31,279
he's trained to kill.

440
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,517
Who are you?

441
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,891
A lot's happened
since you saw Lucy last.

442
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,452
I asked you who you were, hippie.

443
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,293
Please put me down, Bink.

444
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,458
I'm obviously not going to hurt you.

445
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:50,434
I said put me down.

446
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,273
Thank you.

447
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:00,873
I'm Albert Brodsky.

448
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,542
And I was hitchhiking in lndiana

449
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:04,915
on my way to California,

450
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:08,115
and Lucy was kind
enough to give me a lift.

451
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,987
He was drowning in a rain storm!

452
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:12,686
Yes, I was, and Lucy saved my life.

453
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:15,457
And, well, to tell you the truth, Bink,

454
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,192
we were drawn to each other
from the very start,

455
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:21,463
and now, well,

456
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:22,798
I'm in love with her.

457
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,241
Are you in love with me?

458
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,770
Completely.

459
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,897
I'm calling off our engagement.

460
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,307
If I marry you, I don't think
either one of us would be very happy.

461
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,435
Lucy--

462
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,036
I wouldn't be a good wife to you.

463
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,343
I don't take orders that well.

464
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,680
These past few days with Albert,

465
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,813
I've realized that you
and I aren't very close.

466
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,450
You don't even know
that I write children's stories.

467
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,859
I'd like to be a writer one day.
I really would.

468
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:19,421
And if I married you,
I don't think I'd ever do it.

469
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,592
And that's how people
get sick, you know?

470
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,636
They never do what they really want,

471
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,536
and give themselves diseases.

472
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:27,733
And you know something else
that really bothers me,

473
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,800
as long as we're having this discussion?

474
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,469
Is that I never liked the fact

475
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,446
that your stupid car meant
more to you than I did.

476
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,607
Don't call my car stupid.

477
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:38,045
Good-bye, Bink.

478
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,146
Send my apologies
to your folks, please.

479
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,134
Very romantic, Mr. Brodsky.

480
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:55,602
How soon after that was Casey born?

481
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:59,403
The following winter.
December 11, 1975.

482
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,467
Now tell me, please, Mr. Brodsky,

483
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,136
how long did you teach at UCLA?

484
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,703
A little over four years.

485
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,443
Did you spend much time
with your daughter during those years?

486
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:09,178
Yes, I did. Of course I did.

487
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:10,810
I spent a lot of time with her.

488
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:13,789
What prompted you to stop teaching,
Mr. Brodsky?

489
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,720
When I was at UCLA,

490
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:20,355
I used to invite guest lecturers
from the film industry to my class.

491
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,865
One day, I invited
David Kessler, a producer.

492
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,594
Glad you could make it, Ken.

493
00:29:24,668 --> 00:29:26,968
David, I'd like you to meet my wife.

494
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,370
we got to talking after class.

495
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,170
He was impressed
with my knowledge of film

496
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,369
and invited me to his house

497
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:33,139
for a screening of his latest picture.

498
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:35,146
All right. Now we can settle it.

499
00:29:35,214 --> 00:29:38,479
This kid is a walking encyclopedia.

500
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:41,019
I saw that movie on the Late Show last night

501
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,214
with Freddie March

502
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,621
and that blonde dame that Gable went with.

503
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:45,817
Nothing Sacred?

504
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,451
That's it. Nothing Sacred.

505
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:51,063
Who else was in it? Now, listen to this.

506
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,292
Walter Connolly, Charles Winninger,

507
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,391
Sig Ruman,

508
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:55,992
"Slapsie" Maxie Rosenbloom,

509
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,662
former light heavyweight champion
of the world.

510
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,604
It would make a great
remake, wouldn't it?

511
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:02,234
Great? Well, I don't think so.

512
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,575
It wasn't exactly state-of-the-art
filmmaking to begin with.

513
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,410
Beside, it was remade, wasn't it?

514
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,848
Janet Leigh, Jerry Lewis, 1954.

515
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,909
You know, Ben Hecht
wrote that screenplay

516
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:14,956
in a four-day trip on the Super Chief
across the United States.

517
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:16,548
That's pretty good for four days.

518
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:17,990
Where did you find this kid?

519
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:21,455
What do you do?

520
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,861
I write children's books.

521
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:25,230
None of them have
been published yet,

522
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,098
so I'm doing a little typing at home

523
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:28,467
just to help out.

524
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,732
We also have a baby.

525
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,775
Well, she's not a baby anymore.

526
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:34,140
She just turned 3.

527
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:35,769
Do you have kids?

528
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:38,212
Yeah, but I'm not into parenting right now.

529
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:41,842
Oh. Well.

530
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,613
He said, "l think you'll like this.

531
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,589
It's by William Shakespeare."

532
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:48,217
Then he said "And we have
sets by Michelangelo."

533
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,726
And he said, "That's not bad."

534
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:51,820
"And we have a score by Mozart."

535
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:53,694
He said, "l like this. I better read this."

536
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:56,165
He said, "Now, wait a minute.
God's got this girlfriend."

537
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:58,701
Oh, that's--

538
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,897
That's very funny.

539
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,203
Hi. How are you doing?

540
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:06,245
Oh, fine.

541
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:07,609
Good.

542
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,738
I guess--

543
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,612
Hi, sweetheart. Having fun?

544
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:12,651
- Fabulous party.
- Good.

545
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:16,087
I guess going out with David,
you get to see a lot of movies.

546
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:17,987
Oh, yes. Especially
when his wife's away.

547
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,288
David loves screenings.
She hates them.

548
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,352
David's married?

549
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,728
They just celebrated
their 35th wedding anniversary.

550
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,831
Where is she?

551
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:34,365
Skiing, I think, or at a health spa
or something. I don't know.

552
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,569
She loves to travel,
so they're never together.

553
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,478
I think that's why
they've lasted 35 years.

554
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,412
All right, kids. Show time.

555
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,849
Anybody want anything
before we start?

556
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,020
Good night.

557
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:57,224
Good night.

558
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,768
I adored it, darling.
It was just wonderful.

559
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,862
It was gorgeous. I'll cal you tomorrow.

560
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,134
Okay. Good night.

561
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,333
Big hit. Big hit.

562
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:05,433
Thank you.

563
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,499
Congratulations.

564
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:07,566
Thank you.

565
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:09,909
David, thank you
very much for having us.

566
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:11,414
It was very nice to meet you.

567
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:12,574
Dinner was delicious.

568
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,811
Stay and have a little ice cream.

569
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,012
There you are.

570
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:17,316
We thought it was great.

571
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:18,356
Thanks, David.

572
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,654
Thanks for coming.
See you in the morning.

573
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,691
So what didn't you like
about the movie?

574
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,961
No, no. We liked it, didn't we, honey?

575
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,366
We liked it a lot.

576
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:32,996
Yeah, it was real cute. Adorable.

577
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,967
Bad liars. How refreshing.

578
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:41,974
I am really interested in your opinion.

579
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:44,414
Now, what do you think
is wrong with it?

580
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:50,054
- Well, a lot.
- For instance?

581
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:51,386
Well, for one thing,

582
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:53,359
it's cut like a drama,
and it's a comedy, right?

583
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:55,361
Yeah, it's supposed to be.

584
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:57,226
You think the problems are fixable?

585
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:59,357
Sure, if you could recut the film.

586
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,665
I can do anything I want.

587
00:33:05,741 --> 00:33:08,369
Okay.

588
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:11,207
I think your director lost
you at least 10 good jokes.

589
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,576
He cuts on the punch line.

590
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:13,944
I've never seen anything like it.

591
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:15,813
And he mangled the performances.

592
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,875
I saw where the actors
were trying to go,

593
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:19,980
but as soon as I'm about
to be moved, he cuts.

594
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:22,025
So I'm not laughing, I'm not crying.

595
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:24,925
You know, Orson Welles said

596
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,657
that film is the most
emotional medium in the world.

597
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:29,323
I think he's right.

598
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,062
People don't like to leave
a theater feeling empty.

599
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,603
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

600
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:38,665
Well, it's getting late.

601
00:33:38,743 --> 00:33:40,301
Listen, it's a fine film.

602
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:43,211
I see things in pictures
that no one else would ever notice.

603
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:44,748
I'm sure it'll be a big hit.

604
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,148
What if I turn
the picture over to you?

605
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:49,050
Do you think you can fix it for me?

606
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,656
Well, I'm awfully busy
right now, sir.

607
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:54,852
I'm working on a new book--

608
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,090
Post-war Westerns 1946 Through 1952.

609
00:33:58,164 --> 00:33:59,392
It's a very complex subject.

610
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:00,830
Takes up all my free time.

611
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,862
You're absolutely charming.

612
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:07,270
I'm not interested
in your free time, schmuck.

613
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,671
I want you to come work for me.

614
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,370
I'll double your salary. Think about it.

615
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:14,209
I want you to start Monday morning.

616
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:21,416
Well, look, I just think
it would be very good for us.

617
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,320
You can't deny that.

618
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:25,052
Oh, Albert.

619
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,560
You continually misunderstand me.

620
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:30,563
Yes, I agree. It would be great.

621
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:33,600
We could do a lot with $500 a week.

622
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,295
You could buy the BMW.

623
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:37,669
We could get a housekeeper.
We could--

624
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,571
Which would give you time to write.

625
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,371
Do you know how many young directors

626
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,275
David Kessler
has given their start in this business?

627
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,938
If I do a good job for him,

628
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:47,175
Maybe someday
he'll give me a chance to direct.

629
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,218
That's the reason
I came out here to start with.

630
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:50,309
It is?

631
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:51,547
Come on.

632
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,146
Oh, hi, punky.

633
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,282
Hi.

634
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,290
Hi. Yeah.

635
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,691
Oh, honey, did we wake you up?

636
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:00,658
A drink of water, Daddy.

637
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,891
Okay.

638
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,364
It's just the thought of you
working for this Kessler,

639
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,929
a guy with a...

640
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,238
a wife and a girlfriend
and a mansion and--

641
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,207
I don't want to turn into these people.

642
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,442
How are we going to turn
into these people?

643
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,817
I don't know how it happens.

644
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:24,322
Maybe it's something
in the Perrier water.

645
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,617
Oh, take the job.

646
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,184
No, take it. You're right.

647
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:31,525
It'll be good for us.

648
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,191
I'm overreacting.
It's a great opportunity.

649
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:36,030
Congratulations.

650
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,565
Casey, too?

651
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,166
Oh, yes. Casey, too.

652
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:47,270
Albert worked for David Kessler
for the next two years.

653
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:51,574
He became Kessler's
right hand, his left hand,

654
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,781
and the son he never had.

655
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:57,424
Albert bought the BMW he wanted,

656
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:58,960
we hired a housekeeper,

657
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:01,724
and I enrolled in real estate school.

658
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:03,765
And Albert was right about Kessler.

659
00:36:03,832 --> 00:36:06,300
He did offer him
a chance to direct a movie.

660
00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:08,166
I remember the summer afternoon

661
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:12,197
when Kessler first brought up
An American Romance.

662
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:16,234
I tell you, it's a great story.

663
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:19,043
An older man thinks he's dying.

664
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:23,051
Then he falls in love for the first time
with a 25-year-old girl.

665
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,714
Finally, something to live for.

666
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,623
I tried to get this story
made with Bogie and Bacall.

667
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:29,819
Really?

668
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:32,727
35 years I've worked on this project.

669
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:34,424
I've had over 20 writers on it,

670
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:35,965
some of the greats.

671
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,092
Why don't you take a stab at it?

672
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,968
If you can make it work,
you can direct it.

673
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,998
I remember Albert's answer
as if it were yesterday.

674
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,635
No problem.

675
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:56,584
"No problem." What am l, nuts?

676
00:36:56,656 --> 00:37:00,023
Casey, will you hurry up?
We have to leave in five minutes.

677
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,117
I'm coming, I'm coming.

678
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:02,320
Where's my panda?

679
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:03,453
In the living room.

680
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:04,553
How's it going?

681
00:37:04,631 --> 00:37:06,496
Great, great. You got a minute?

682
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:09,330
She has to be in gym class
in 15 minutes,

683
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:11,895
and I still have to pick up
Todd and Laura. Why?

684
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:13,372
I wanted to read you something.

685
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,807
Good. No. I'd love to hear it.

686
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,976
Excuse me. What are you
doing in my purse?

687
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,140
I need lip gloss.

688
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:22,513
No, you don't.

689
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:24,313
- Mommy.
- Give me that.

690
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:29,489
Okay. Thank you very much.

691
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:31,355
Sorry.

692
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:33,088
Go ahead.

693
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:35,926
"lnterior of a taxi. Day. It's drizzling.

694
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:38,159
"The taxi drives down
a suburban street.

695
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:39,326
"ln the back seat

696
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:40,734
"is a beautiful young woman, Rebecca Tyler.

697
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,635
Her eyes are closed. The driver--"

698
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:43,832
What are you doing?

699
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:44,931
I'm hot.

700
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,339
Honey, put that back on, please,

701
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,675
and go sit in the car
for me. Thank you.

702
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:52,214
I'm listening. Her eyes are closed.

703
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:53,544
All right. Her eyes--

704
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:55,608
"The driver says,
'Where are you from??

705
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:56,949
"Rebecca says, 'Here,

706
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,682
"but I haven't been
home in a long time'.

707
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,815
"The driver says, 'What's the occasion??

708
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,452
She says, 'My mother's
getting married'."

709
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:04,654
That's all I have so far.

710
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,560
I have a terrific idea for a shot.

711
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:08,189
Start inside the taxi.

712
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,790
I like starting in the taxi.

713
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:10,925
But?

714
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:14,029
Well, this may be stupid,

715
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:16,006
but why don't you just
stay on the driver

716
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:17,542
and hear Rebecca's voice?

717
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,543
Like maybe shoot it
from her viewpoint

718
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,579
and looking out the window,
you know?

719
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,980
You could see kids playing
where she used to play

720
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,813
And then, when you go
to Rebecca's house,

721
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,015
you haven't really seen
Rebecca yet, you know?

722
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:34,221
Also, I don't know if I'd mention
why Rebecca's coming home.

723
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:36,661
Why?

724
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,859
Well, let the story
unfold a little more slowly.

725
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,995
You know it's her mother's wedding
once you're inside the house.

726
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,801
Oh, I don't know.
Your way's probably better.

727
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:47,136
After I drop her off,

728
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,540
I'm going to the market,

729
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,168
and then I have to go
the vacuum place,

730
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,736
and then I've got my class,
and then I'll be home.

731
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:53,838
Come on. Let's go.

732
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:54,904
Okay, sweetie.

733
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:56,507
There's chicken in the fridge.

734
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:08,095
Luce. Luce.

735
00:39:08,164 --> 00:39:11,497
Could we work together a little
this afternoon?

736
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:15,095
I have to study for
my real estate exam.

737
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,606
The pressure's starting
to get to me a little.

738
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:19,801
If you could work with me
for a couple of hours,

739
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:21,105
help me get back on track.

740
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:23,009
I'd really appreciate it.

741
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,241
Come on.
You are the writer in the family.

742
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,547
We worked that afternoon

743
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:35,059
and the next afternoon

744
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:38,118
and the next...

745
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,027
and the next.

746
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:43,033
Finally, Albert just came out
and asked me to write with him.

747
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:45,503
When we started writing,
it was early summer.

748
00:39:45,572 --> 00:39:48,063
We finished right after Christmas.

749
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,413
Maria, did she have her dinner?

750
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:03,013
Thank you.

751
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,216
Good night.

752
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,850
Good night.

753
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:18,539
What?

754
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:20,199
Was it good?

755
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,907
It's great.

756
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:28,574
How great?

757
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,711
You're kidding.

758
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,620
Can we hug?

759
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,384
Real hard?

760
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:42,420
I'll never love anybody in my life
the way I love you.

761
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,159
Kessler said our script
was one of the best he'd ever read.

762
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:47,795
We shot the movie that spring.

763
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,308
Suddenly, the best times of our lives
were about to change.

764
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:16,967
They turned people away
from the last two shows.

765
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,939
What's-his-name, the manager,

766
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:23,306
said we are breaking house records.

767
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:26,879
I never, never expected this.

768
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,073
Well, how's the audience?

769
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:29,274
Just like last night.

770
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,749
They applauded when she left.

771
00:41:31,818 --> 00:41:33,480
They're laughing in all the right places.

772
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:36,787
What are you doing?

773
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,985
I am figuring out how much we're
going to make, dear.

774
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,552
8 foreign, 4 for the TV sale,

775
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,655
2 for ancillary rights.

776
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:46,131
Did you order me something?

777
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:48,203
Let's see. Divide that in half,

778
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,295
of which we have 5 percent--

779
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:52,966
Kessler's going to make
a bloody fortune out of this picture.

780
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,474
What's this?

781
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:58,138
For Monsieur Brodsky
from Monsieur Ballentine.

782
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,716
Albert Brodsky, nice to see you again.

783
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,728
Suddenly, Albert was
Hollywood's new darling.

784
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,321
Not only was the movie
a box-office smash,

785
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:18,026
but the reviews were phenomenal.

786
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,435
Newsweek called it a masterpiece.

787
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:24,441
The New Yorker said
it was a landmark in movie history.

788
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:28,843
And Time called Albert
the director of his generation.

789
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,404
What a nice guy.

790
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:31,710
Who is he?

791
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,080
I have no idea.

792
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,312
There's Albert Brodsky.

793
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,685
- Where?
- Right there, with the girl.

794
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:41,217
5 percent of 7.5 million.

795
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:42,693
How do you multiply on this thing?

796
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:44,252
Ah, wait, here we go.

797
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:54,904
Well, what do you think?

798
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,840
Any price tags on me?

799
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,037
No.

800
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:01,013
If you didn't know me,

801
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,810
would you think I was
wearing contact lenses?

802
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,852
No. Would you open the door?

803
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,181
It's kind of hot in here.

804
00:43:06,254 --> 00:43:08,950
Did I tell you about the guy
I met in the commissary yesterday?

805
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:10,491
I was with David, and he said,

806
00:43:10,558 --> 00:43:12,458
"I'd like you to meet Albert Brodsky,"

807
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:14,256
and the man gasped
when he heard my name.

808
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:15,921
Gee, that's great.

809
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,396
She's doing it again.

810
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,904
Stop it. I want you
to speak to us in English.

811
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,206
Well, we want you to.

812
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:37,747
Casey, honey,
we're going away for two weeks.

813
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:40,985
We'd like our last words
to be in English.

814
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,833
This is my fault.

815
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:55,430
I'm not with her enough.
She's getting me back.

816
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,441
She just feels
a little neglected, that's all.

817
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,841
Yeah, and what do we do
to make her feel better?

818
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:01,470
We go away for two weeks.

819
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:03,481
Maria, did you see
my tux shirt by any chance?

820
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:04,675
Is it packed?

821
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,944
Your tuxedo shirt? Sí.

822
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,112
Good. Would you make me
a quick glass of iced tea

823
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,212
- before I go?
- Sí.

824
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:12,258
Lucy, call the office
about a car in Cannes.

825
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:15,624
Hey, do it yourself.
I don't work for you.

826
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:19,694
What's the matter with you?

827
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,731
Sometimes I wish
we'd never made this stupid movie.

828
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:28,172
What?

829
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,870
This hasn't been
the greatest year of your life?

830
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:34,108
Yes. In some ways.

831
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:36,115
It's also been
like the worst year of my life.

832
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:37,275
What are you telling me,

833
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:38,717
you don't like your new house,

834
00:44:38,787 --> 00:44:40,914
that you wrote the biggest
picture of the year,

835
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:42,684
that finally we got a little clout?

836
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,089
We? What we?

837
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,821
You're just upset because
I'm getting all the accolades.

838
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,556
Yeah, well, so would you be

839
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,394
if you did half the work
and no one mentioned your name.

840
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:52,958
Every interview I do,

841
00:44:53,036 --> 00:44:55,004
I tell them you laid down the script.

842
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:58,508
Hey, pal, I did more than lay it down.

843
00:44:58,575 --> 00:45:00,770
You couldn't write
a word without me.

844
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:03,005
This is like Bink's car being stolen.

845
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,843
It's not my fault
they're giving me all the credit.

846
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,213
Maybe I don't get credit
because I'm a woman.

847
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:08,752
Now you're a feminist.

848
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,981
Please, Lucy, don't do this to me, okay?

849
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:13,046
Why don't you just go
to Cannes without me?

850
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:14,489
What is the matter with you?

851
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:15,685
I don't like you anymore, okay?

852
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,490
I don't like how possessed you are

853
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:21,623
with your movie and your clothes
and your contacts and your clout.

854
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:23,291
It's enough, already!

855
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:24,358
It's boring.

856
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:26,631
I've got such a headache.

857
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,209
I want something else
out of my life, Albert.

858
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,180
I want some romance.

859
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:39,218
I want some fun.

860
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,652
I want to be like we used to be.

861
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:44,053
Well, I don't.

862
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,554
The child emancipation case
of Brodsky versus Brodsky and Brodsky

863
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,859
closed its second week of testimony today.

864
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:54,400
Sources close to
Lucy Van Patten Brodsky

865
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:56,595
say that Monday's
testimony will include

866
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,798
the name that everyone
familiar with this case

867
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:00,067
has been waiting for.

868
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:02,234
That name, of course, Blake Chandler.

869
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,834
More on that part of the story now

870
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,141
from Entertainment Editor
Rex Reed. Rex.

871
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:08,182
Thank you, Kelly.

872
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:11,482
After the phenomenal success
of An American Romance,

873
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:13,317
Albert Brodsky joined the ranks

874
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:14,754
of such superstar directors

875
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,224
as Francis Ford Coppola,
Peter Bogdanovich,

876
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:18,555
and Steven Spielberg.

877
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:21,324
Brodsky was, as they say, hot.

878
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:24,457
His only problem was
what to do for an encore.

879
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,730
He and his then-wife and coscripter,

880
00:46:26,804 --> 00:46:28,203
Lucy Van Patten Brodsky,

881
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:30,103
found an obscure French novella

882
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:32,074
entitled La vision de gabrielle,

883
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:35,339
the story of an artist's model
who inspired the lmpressionists.

884
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:38,006
This, of course, became
the hit film Gabrielle.

885
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:41,143
Now, every star and would-be
star across two continents

886
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:43,813
vied for the coveted role of Gabrielle,

887
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:48,349
but Albert Brodsky
was looking for a new face.

888
00:46:48,426 --> 00:46:50,951
Enter Blake Chandler.

889
00:47:10,016 --> 00:47:12,952
We read her. She's not right.

890
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,079
Who? Oh, yeah.

891
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:16,679
Well, yes, she's
a wonderful actress.

892
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:18,247
She's not pretty enough.

893
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:20,259
Yeah. Well, I like her, too,

894
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,227
but she's too old for Gabrielle.

895
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:25,595
We need that young, sexy, gorgeous,

896
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,295
fabulous-looking, you know?

897
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:29,303
We need a face you could die from.

898
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,801
Listen, could I call you right back?

899
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,240
Albert just walked in.

900
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,368
Okay, thanks.

901
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,608
Please call if you're going to be
two hours late, okay?

902
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,082
We're starving.

903
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,177
Betsy called,
and David called twice from New York.

904
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:45,516
He's at the Sherry.

905
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:46,953
Hi, Daddy.

906
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:49,355
Hi, pumpkin.

907
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:51,690
Where have you been?
You look funny.

908
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,524
I was driving around, thinking,

909
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:56,622
and I stopped to get a Coke
at this hot dog stand,

910
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,669
and there was a girl there.

911
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:01,569
I took one look at her,
and I knew she was Gabrielle.

912
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:04,533
You're kidding.

913
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:05,836
She's incredible. She's perfect.

914
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,741
She is the character.

915
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:10,940
Well, great. We'll test her.

916
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:12,642
What do you want to drink?

917
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:15,711
She wouldn't test.

918
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:17,982
Ah, well, what are you
going to do, you know?

919
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:19,683
She sells hot dogs for a living.

920
00:48:19,758 --> 00:48:21,316
I wouldn't exactly be upset.

921
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:24,259
I hired her, Luce.

922
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,965
Hi.

923
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:31,367
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

924
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:38,569
This is great.

925
00:48:38,644 --> 00:48:41,943
I haven't had
a decent meal in months.

926
00:48:42,015 --> 00:48:46,181
How long have you been working
at this hot dog place?

927
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:48,882
Oh, for about
three months, I guess.

928
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:52,620
Before that, I was going with
this guy Giorgio.

929
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:55,219
He said he wanted to marry me.

930
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:56,957
He was so sick.

931
00:48:57,032 --> 00:48:58,294
I mean, just because

932
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:00,062
I wouldn't go to Acapulco
with him for the weekend,

933
00:49:00,136 --> 00:49:01,763
he tries to strangle me.

934
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:03,600
You can still see
the choke marks on my neck.

935
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:04,764
See?

936
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,364
That's how I met
Waldo and Doug,

937
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,069
the guys who own
the hot dog stand.

938
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,078
They saved my life.

939
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,376
When I jumped out of the car

940
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:14,541
The night Giorgio tried to kill me,

941
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,745
I was right in front
of the hot dog stand.

942
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,151
Doug and Wally saw the whole thing.

943
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,813
Since I didn't have anywhere to go,

944
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,982
Doug and Wally and took me in.

945
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,787
But I need to get
out of their place soon.

946
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,121
They're getting married.

947
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,354
Waldo and Doug?

948
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,294
Yeah. I'm going to be
their maid of honor.

949
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,127
Blake, I don't know how much

950
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,193
Albert told you about our film, but--

951
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,666
Well...

952
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,404
he told me a little in the car,

953
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,275
but he kept losing
his train of thought.

954
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,009
He was so nervous with me driving.

955
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:48,881
Driving what?

956
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:49,978
Your Mercedes.

957
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:51,989
She drove the Mercedes?

958
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,254
She never drove one before.

959
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,687
Casita, Malcolm's on the phone.

960
00:49:58,764 --> 00:50:00,356
I'll be right back.

961
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:01,526
Malcolm's her boyfriend.

962
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:02,899
Since when?

963
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,133
Since they did their art project
together two weeks ago.

964
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,765
My God, he's all she talks about.

965
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:08,866
Where have you been?

966
00:50:08,943 --> 00:50:10,103
I've been working.

967
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,576
That's what I do. I work.

968
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:13,135
We all work.

969
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:18,619
Did I miss anything?

970
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:20,655
Finish your dinner.

971
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:27,392
Blake, do you know anything
about the period of our film,

972
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:29,987
turn-of-the-century Paris,
the lmpressionists?

973
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:32,295
Well, I know a little,

974
00:50:32,368 --> 00:50:37,328
Iike the girls sort of
with their hair like this.

975
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:41,804
'ello to you.

976
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,569
Did I tell you?

977
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,781
So, what's your schedule like?

978
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:52,481
We've got a lot of work to do
and not a lot time.

979
00:50:52,556 --> 00:50:54,547
I'm totally loose.

980
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,991
All I have to do is quit my job

981
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,618
and find a new place to live.

982
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,659
Albert felt if Blake moved in with us,

983
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:08,229
we could work with her day and night
and transform her into Gabrielle.

984
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:12,072
Frankly, I wanted to transform her
into an apartment down the street.

985
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:14,873
But I thought maybe Albert was right,

986
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,278
and I owed it to him to give it a try.

987
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:20,410
You see, unconsciously,
Gabrielle knows

988
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:22,455
that when Henri paints her

989
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:25,650
and his brush strokes the canvas,

990
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:28,956
in his mind, he's actually
stroking her flesh,

991
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:30,656
which he knows he can't do,

992
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,527
and that frustrates him
and excites her.

993
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,932
Now I want to be able
to feel that excitement.

994
00:51:35,002 --> 00:51:37,903
I want to be able
to see you almost begin to tremble.

995
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:39,132
That's good.

996
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,976
I'm not happy lately.

997
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:45,945
Oh, don't start, Lucy, please.

998
00:51:46,013 --> 00:51:48,538
We never used to act this way.

999
00:51:48,616 --> 00:51:51,279
We never used to be distant or bicker.

1000
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:52,650
I feel like my mother.

1001
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:55,485
You're going to tell me
this is Blake's fault again, right?

1002
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:58,287
Albert, you have to admit
ever since she came into our lives--

1003
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,349
What?

1004
00:52:00,596 --> 00:52:03,087
Jesus, Mr. Defensive, I'll tell you.

1005
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:04,689
She's changed our lives, okay?

1006
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:05,859
How? How?

1007
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:12,004
Well, we're never alone, for one thing,

1008
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:14,873
and you never touch me when we are.

1009
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:21,279
Well, we haven't been that romantic
in a long time.

1010
00:52:21,352 --> 00:52:22,979
You're telling me.

1011
00:52:23,053 --> 00:52:25,613
Yesterday I found a cobweb
on my diaphragm.

1012
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,055
God, you're so sarcastic lately.

1013
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:32,392
Sorry.

1014
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:36,967
It's just that sexually I was hoping

1015
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:40,199
that things would get
better between us,

1016
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:41,831
not worse.

1017
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:46,277
Sometimes I think you're in love with her.

1018
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:50,179
Oh, come on. I'm in love
with Gabrielle, not Blake.

1019
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,582
That's the way I work. I can't help it.

1020
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:53,779
Wasn't I the same way

1021
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:56,288
in American Romance with Rebecca?

1022
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,381
Rebecca didn't live with us.

1023
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:00,858
Do you think this girl
would be doing half as well

1024
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,794
if we didn't work with her
day and night?

1025
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:10,335
You're right. Everything's fine.

1026
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:12,532
Okay? Is that what
you want me to say?

1027
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,102
Everything is fine.

1028
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:21,212
I adore you.

1029
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,547
Oh, Albert, I missed you.

1030
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:39,096
It's me.

1031
00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:46,173
Come in.

1032
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:50,503
Hi.

1033
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,013
- Hi.
- Hi.

1034
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:57,414
I'm sorry to bug you guys,

1035
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,787
but I couldn't sleep.

1036
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:02,588
I don't know how to say this,

1037
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:04,652
but for the first time in my life,

1038
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,597
I really feel like I'm part of a family.

1039
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:11,068
I think you're both
such incredible people.

1040
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:17,040
Lucy, I admire you so much.

1041
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,101
I never met a woman like you.

1042
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:22,739
You've got a great kid

1043
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:25,080
and a beautiful house.

1044
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:26,847
You're a fantastic cook

1045
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,717
and a brilliant writer.

1046
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:29,756
No.

1047
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:31,814
And a good friend.

1048
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:37,853
I love you both so much.

1049
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:42,464
Well, that's all.

1050
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:44,232
I just want you to know

1051
00:54:44,305 --> 00:54:48,173
how much I appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1052
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:52,540
Oh, Blake.

1053
00:55:01,457 --> 00:55:02,481
Good night.

1054
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,291
Good night.

1055
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:12,430
I apologize.

1056
00:55:12,503 --> 00:55:14,437
I'm nuts.

1057
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,530
She's a great kid.

1058
00:55:18,643 --> 00:55:19,735
Good night.

1059
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:35,254
Cut it. Cut it, please.

1060
00:55:36,762 --> 00:55:38,127
Did I do something wrong?

1061
00:55:38,197 --> 00:55:39,960
No, you're terrific, honey. It's me.

1062
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:41,364
Reggie, put a double in that 10k.

1063
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:42,731
I think it's the blocking.

1064
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:44,667
Let me just think for a second.

1065
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,267
There aren't any sparks between them.

1066
00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:51,037
There's no heat.
There's no chemistry.

1067
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,839
Something about it doesn't
seem too real to me.

1068
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:54,072
I don't know what.

1069
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:55,671
The reality is that
Gabrielle would be nude.

1070
00:55:55,748 --> 00:55:57,080
This is a cheat.

1071
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:58,516
Nude? What do you mean nude?

1072
00:55:58,586 --> 00:55:59,712
Frontal nudity is an R.

1073
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:01,516
I don't want to mess with the ratings.

1074
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,386
It's the difference
between a scene that works

1075
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:04,924
and a scene that doesn't work.

1076
00:56:04,992 --> 00:56:07,222
Come on, Lucy. It rings the bell.

1077
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:09,962
Think she'd do it?

1078
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,965
I don't know. Let me ask her.

1079
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:15,392
Don't pressure her. She's just a kid.

1080
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:18,462
Can I have her, please?

1081
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,208
Works for me.

1082
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,447
Blake, don't forget,

1083
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:32,819
in the scene we're doing tomorrow,

1084
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,152
that Gabrielle is still a little scruffy.

1085
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,748
No nail polish, no earrings,

1086
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,123
and she's still real intimidated--

1087
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,252
You finished?

1088
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,488
... by Henri. Yes, thank you.

1089
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,121
And a little more tea, please.

1090
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,724
Also, honey, I've been
thinking about that scene

1091
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,234
where Gabrielle has the baby.

1092
00:56:45,303 --> 00:56:47,863
I want to rewrite the dialogue
before you shoot it.

1093
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:51,636
Also, I think we should try it
with rain against the window.

1094
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:56,271
I think it would play better
if Henri comes in a little wet.

1095
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:17,867
Look, nothing's forever.

1096
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:21,802
Five out of every eight marriages
end in divorce.

1097
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,206
Now we're a statistic. So what?

1098
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,971
I always figured we'd never last.

1099
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,219
Do you want this, please?

1100
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,948
Uh, no. You can have it.

1101
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:36,489
Fine.

1102
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,127
You're incredible, Lucy.

1103
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,890
I'm a grownup, Albert.

1104
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,661
You tell me you're in love with Blake.

1105
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:46,565
What am I supposed to do, kill myself?

1106
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:49,730
Throw myself off the Hollywood sign?

1107
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:51,296
I'll live.

1108
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:53,467
Let's not be sad.

1109
00:57:53,543 --> 00:57:55,636
We had nine good years.

1110
00:57:55,712 --> 00:57:57,236
The best.

1111
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:59,508
Obviously not the best,

1112
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:02,211
but we did have our good times.

1113
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,380
Here's your sweater.

1114
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:09,824
I had it dry-cleaned.

1115
00:58:09,893 --> 00:58:11,622
You're so thoughtful.

1116
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,631
Mommy, when are we
going to come back?

1117
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,197
Never.

1118
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:25,970
Kiss your father good-bye.

1119
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,739
Is it something I did?

1120
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:29,109
I won't be fresh anymore.

1121
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,204
I promise.

1122
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:38,615
Oh, honey.

1123
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,870
I have no life.

1124
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,078
I have no husband, no home.

1125
00:58:59,146 --> 00:59:01,171
This isn't my street anymore.

1126
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:04,811
What am I supposed to do now,

1127
00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:06,479
go to singles' bars,

1128
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:08,147
get new clothes, look hot?

1129
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:10,384
No.

1130
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:13,485
That bimbo stole my husband!

1131
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:15,689
They had an affair,

1132
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,198
probably in my bed,

1133
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:19,098
on my sheets.

1134
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:21,296
I'm sorry.

1135
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:23,839
They drank their lovers'
wine out of glasses

1136
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:26,000
I stood in line to buy.

1137
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:31,346
Who's going to take care of us now?

1138
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:35,149
Most parents get divorced.

1139
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:36,811
Really, Mom.

1140
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:39,048
None of my friends' parents are married.

1141
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:42,251
So what is that? Good?

1142
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:48,733
This wasn't supposed
to happen to us.

1143
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:53,528
Oh, where am I driving?

1144
01:00:01,379 --> 01:00:02,812
Come here.

1145
01:00:10,056 --> 01:00:13,253
My mom and I spent
that night at our corner.

1146
01:00:13,326 --> 01:00:18,195
The next day,
we got ourselves a little apartment.

1147
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:21,133
My mom had some
of the profits of Gabrielle,

1148
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:24,603
but she sold her part early
so we could afford to live.

1149
01:00:24,672 --> 01:00:26,765
Then, when Gabrielle came out,

1150
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,002
it made lots of money.

1151
01:00:29,077 --> 01:00:31,841
My mom didn't make anything.

1152
01:00:31,913 --> 01:00:33,881
My dad and Blake got real rich

1153
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:36,884
and moved into a mansion
in Beverly Hills.

1154
01:00:36,952 --> 01:00:40,581
My mom didn't want to have
anything to do with my dad.

1155
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:45,192
She said he was
a worthless human being

1156
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:47,354
who didn't deserve to know us.

1157
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:57,439
I guess I won't lean into it.

1158
01:00:57,507 --> 01:00:59,270
That would be a good idea.

1159
01:01:00,644 --> 01:01:03,306
Now, Casey,

1160
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,941
after your parents got divorced,

1161
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:08,611
how often did you see your dad?

1162
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:12,349
Whenever he could see me,
mostly on weekends.

1163
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:15,017
Would you say
you remained close with your father?

1164
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:17,686
No.

1165
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:21,547
My dad changed a lot
once he started living with Blake.

1166
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,307
Blake's mom moved in with them, too.

1167
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,972
She was a real jerk.

1168
01:01:49,048 --> 01:01:50,515
Her name was Dotty.

1169
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:53,314
She used to be a manicurist
at some hotel in Houston.

1170
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:55,582
Hold on, please.

1171
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:57,589
Blake, it's The New York Times.

1172
01:01:57,657 --> 01:01:59,352
Oh, honey, you talk to them.

1173
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,656
- Yeah?
- You're so much better at this than me.

1174
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:03,593
- No.
- Yes.

1175
01:02:03,663 --> 01:02:04,891
Okay.

1176
01:02:06,032 --> 01:02:07,193
I'll take it, Dotty.

1177
01:02:08,403 --> 01:02:10,701
This is Miss Chandler's
manager speaking.

1178
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:13,934
Pardon me?

1179
01:02:14,008 --> 01:02:15,600
I didn't say anything.

1180
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:17,644
Yes, you did. I heard you.

1181
01:02:17,712 --> 01:02:19,543
Well, then, you're hearing things.

1182
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:21,912
We'll play some doubles. Bye-bye.

1183
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,647
What's the trouble?

1184
01:02:26,722 --> 01:02:28,917
Lucy Junior's
making fun of me again.

1185
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:31,357
I wasn't this time, I promise.

1186
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:34,396
I swear to God I was
minding my own business.

1187
01:02:35,831 --> 01:02:38,027
You want Maria
to take you shopping?

1188
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,090
Maria!

1189
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:40,932
Yes, Mr. Albert?

1190
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,904
I don't want to go shopping.

1191
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:47,899
Well, girls, what shall
we screen tonight, huh?

1192
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:49,035
Any suggestions?

1193
01:02:49,112 --> 01:02:51,080
Black Stallion,
please, please, please,

1194
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:52,546
please, please, please, please?

1195
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,710
That's fine. I'll go out
with Mother tonight.

1196
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:56,083
Wait, wait.

1197
01:02:56,154 --> 01:02:57,212
Suggest something else.

1198
01:02:57,289 --> 01:02:58,950
How about Gabrielle?

1199
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:00,616
Yuck! Again?

1200
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:02,353
How about Gabrielle, Blake?

1201
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:04,657
Great, boobie.

1202
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:07,698
See? Now everybody's happy.

1203
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,729
Lucy Brodsky. Is he in?

1204
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:17,503
Hi, Jeff. How are you doing?

1205
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:19,374
Hey.

1206
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:20,605
Yeah. Great, thanks.

1207
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,739
No, no. I'm really doing great.

1208
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:27,276
It's been about a year,
but we've stayed close.

1209
01:03:27,354 --> 01:03:31,415
Actually, I'm writing.
I'm working on a novel.

1210
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:33,153
Well, it's going pretty slowly.

1211
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,888
That's why I was calling.

1212
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:38,557
I wondered if you'd found a writer
for your new picture.

1213
01:03:40,768 --> 01:03:44,397
Well, I cowrote
An American Romance and Gabrielle.

1214
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,334
Well, I don't have anything to show you

1215
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:49,706
that I wrote on my own.

1216
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:50,937
I never wrote alone.

1217
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:55,917
Sure, sure. I understand.

1218
01:03:55,985 --> 01:03:59,682
Well, I can appreciate that.

1219
01:03:59,755 --> 01:04:01,814
Who?

1220
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,825
I really don't think I'm the best person

1221
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:05,758
to help you get to Blake Chandler.

1222
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:07,955
Why don't you try her agent?

1223
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,157
Yes, I'll mention it to Albert.

1224
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:11,724
You're welcome.

1225
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:15,629
Putz.

1226
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,681
You haven't
changed your clothes all weekend.

1227
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:35,090
Hi, Lucy.

1228
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,752
Did you ask him about child support?

1229
01:04:36,828 --> 01:04:37,852
I forgot.

1230
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,454
What, you didn't get it?

1231
01:04:39,531 --> 01:04:41,055
My accountant said he sent it.

1232
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:45,002
Tell your father how much
gymnastics lessons cost

1233
01:04:45,071 --> 01:04:47,005
and how much the new
Blondie album is

1234
01:04:47,073 --> 01:04:48,870
and about the new Nikes you want.

1235
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:51,103
I don't need new Nikes.

1236
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,771
Would you like to eat
for the rest of the week?

1237
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:56,440
I'm sure Miss Chandler's eating just fine.

1238
01:04:56,516 --> 01:04:58,951
Lucy, the money was due yesterday.

1239
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:01,579
Yeah, and last month's
ran out two weeks ago.

1240
01:05:01,655 --> 01:05:05,056
Get it here on time, buddy,
or I'm taking you back to court.

1241
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,457
I'm going to go watch TV.

1242
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,496
When can I see Casey again?

1243
01:05:09,563 --> 01:05:11,326
Why, do you plan on being with her?

1244
01:05:11,398 --> 01:05:13,959
She called me six times from your
house yesterday.

1245
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,832
You know, she doesn't
love staring at Blake

1246
01:05:15,904 --> 01:05:16,893
as much as you do.

1247
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:18,200
You're obsessed with Blake.

1248
01:05:18,273 --> 01:05:20,332
No, pal. You're obsessed with Blake.

1249
01:05:20,408 --> 01:05:22,103
All right. I'm sorry.
You're obsessed with--

1250
01:05:22,177 --> 01:05:23,838
I'm surprised I can eat,

1251
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:26,107
upset as I am.

1252
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:33,749
Come in.

1253
01:05:38,695 --> 01:05:40,390
Kathy, there's something
I want to say.

1254
01:05:40,464 --> 01:05:41,897
I want to tell you something.

1255
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,434
Ladies first.

1256
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:46,265
What did you want to tell me?

1257
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:49,534
Daddy, I've been awful mean to you,

1258
01:05:49,607 --> 01:05:52,633
and I'm sorry, real honest sorry.

1259
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,144
Well, I've been mean
to you, too, kitten, and I'm sorry.

1260
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:58,205
I've been mean to you, too, dear.

1261
01:05:58,282 --> 01:06:00,547
Will you accept our apologies?

1262
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:02,052
I don't know.

1263
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:04,180
Your mom and I love you so much.

1264
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,484
You do?

1265
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:07,525
Of course we do. And to prove it,

1266
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,061
your father and l
have a surprise for you.

1267
01:06:10,129 --> 01:06:12,461
Your mom and I are
going to get married again.

1268
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,557
- You are?
- Blake's disappeared,

1269
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:17,831
and I realize I still love Mom.

1270
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:20,737
We're going to live happily ever after, dear.

1271
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:25,605
So?

1272
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:28,910
Mom, I'm trying to watch TV.

1273
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,018
Just tell me, how was Blake?

1274
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:37,683
She wears too much jewelry.

1275
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:41,723
Daddy buys her jewelry?

1276
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:44,594
Daddy buys her everything.

1277
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,701
What kind of jewelry?
Diamonds, what?

1278
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:53,139
I don't know. They're mostly green.

1279
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,201
Emeralds. He buys her emeralds.

1280
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:58,713
He never bought me
one piece of jewelry ever.

1281
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,148
Nothing. Not even an engagement ring.

1282
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,713
What did you do last night?

1283
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,315
Watched movies in the screening room,

1284
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:12,556
and then Blake washed
her hair for 10 hours.

1285
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:15,189
What kind of towels do they have?

1286
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,530
Mother, will you stop it?

1287
01:07:17,602 --> 01:07:20,196
I am trying to watch TV.

1288
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:24,375
He's turning you against me.

1289
01:07:24,442 --> 01:07:26,910
You don't love me anymore, either.

1290
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:28,570
I love you.

1291
01:07:29,948 --> 01:07:30,937
I'm sorry.

1292
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:34,385
What are we going to do
on New Year's Eve, pal?

1293
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:36,887
I'm invited to a party.

1294
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:38,821
Oh, really? Whose?

1295
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:40,882
Blake and Daddy's.

1296
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,621
Blake and Daddy's.

1297
01:07:59,946 --> 01:08:02,212
Hey, hey, hey! I'm not staying.

1298
01:08:03,218 --> 01:08:05,880
Are you okay, Mom?

1299
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:07,285
Sure.

1300
01:08:09,658 --> 01:08:11,057
Call me.

1301
01:08:25,141 --> 01:08:26,733
Bye, Mom.

1302
01:08:31,681 --> 01:08:33,013
Great.

1303
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,184
Hi.

1304
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:46,723
Say, I was wondering,

1305
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:49,790
could you give me a lift into St. Louis
or any town that's got a--

1306
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:51,267
That's not funny.

1307
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:54,505
Where's Casey?

1308
01:08:54,573 --> 01:08:56,803
She just went inside.

1309
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:03,377
I just ran to the store for Blake's mom.

1310
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:06,282
Would you like to come in
and have a drink?

1311
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:08,183
No. I can't.

1312
01:09:08,254 --> 01:09:10,347
I got to get home and get dressed.

1313
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:11,651
Oh, yeah? You going out?

1314
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:13,589
Yeah. Big party.

1315
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:16,526
Great. Well, Happy New Year, Luce.

1316
01:09:16,596 --> 01:09:18,461
I'll see you.

1317
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,695
Happy New Year.

1318
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:46,359
Great party, Al.

1319
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:48,361
Happy New Year.

1320
01:10:50,264 --> 01:10:51,595
Hi.

1321
01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:58,531
Daddy?

1322
01:10:58,606 --> 01:11:00,233
- Hey, Casey, you having fun?
- Yeah.

1323
01:11:00,308 --> 01:11:01,366
Have you seen Blake?

1324
01:11:01,443 --> 01:11:03,536
She's in there.

1325
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:05,511
Daddy, are you going
to dance with me?

1326
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,344
Later, pumpkin, later.

1327
01:11:15,925 --> 01:11:17,916
Happy New Year!

1328
01:11:26,737 --> 01:11:27,965
You're just saying that

1329
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,506
because you want me
to star in your picture.

1330
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:32,337
Albert, come here, kid.

1331
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:33,433
I've been looking for you.

1332
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:35,341
Oh, you look beautiful, Elaine.

1333
01:11:35,412 --> 01:11:37,209
Blake did a fabulous job on the house.

1334
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,646
- Thanks.
- Elaine, darling!

1335
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:40,240
Hello, Gladys.

1336
01:11:40,318 --> 01:11:41,979
Hey, I want to talk to you.

1337
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:43,452
Excuse us.

1338
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:46,081
Blake's sister is quite a number, huh?

1339
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:47,419
That's her mother.

1340
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:49,790
You're kidding.

1341
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:52,261
Lucky boy.

1342
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,959
Listen, uh, I got to talk to you.

1343
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:55,296
Come here.

1344
01:11:57,971 --> 01:12:01,737
You know, when you first came to me
with your Gone With The Wind musical,

1345
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:04,072
I thought you had something,
my right hand to God.

1346
01:12:04,144 --> 01:12:05,475
Yeah?

1347
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:10,142
But, uh, I listened to
Blake's tapes this afternoon.

1348
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:11,548
Was that singing?

1349
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,086
No, I don't think so.

1350
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:16,089
Singing is Lisa Minnelli, Barbra,

1351
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:17,920
even Julie Budd, that's singing.

1352
01:12:17,992 --> 01:12:21,120
But this was like, uh...

1353
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:22,253
I just didn't get it.

1354
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:24,730
Come on. She's taking lessons.

1355
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,097
What are you worried about?

1356
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:27,362
What have my pictures grossed,

1357
01:12:27,436 --> 01:12:28,562
70, $80 million?

1358
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:29,695
I know what I'm doing.

1359
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:30,863
Blake Chandler can do anything.

1360
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:32,236
She's the actress of her generation.

1361
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:33,934
Yeah, but listen to me.

1362
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:35,476
Blake was terrific in Gabrielle,

1363
01:12:35,544 --> 01:12:38,445
a great marriage of an actress and a part.

1364
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:39,947
She didn't have to say too much.

1365
01:12:40,016 --> 01:12:41,608
She pouted, she showed her tits.

1366
01:12:41,684 --> 01:12:44,676
But a singing Scarlett O'Hara she is not.

1367
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:47,689
You're going too far
out on a limb with this girl.

1368
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,349
I mean, she's got you by the balls.

1369
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:50,790
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1370
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,987
Look, I may not have talent,

1371
01:12:53,062 --> 01:12:54,962
I may not have a genius lQ,

1372
01:12:55,031 --> 01:12:58,195
but one thing I do have is gut instinct.

1373
01:12:58,268 --> 01:12:59,701
It told me to hire you.

1374
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:02,136
It told me to give you
An American Romance.

1375
01:13:02,206 --> 01:13:05,198
and now it is telling me to bail out.

1376
01:13:05,275 --> 01:13:07,539
Wait. I thought we were
partners on this one.

1377
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,083
Look, I played Blake's tapes
for the studio today.

1378
01:13:13,152 --> 01:13:15,450
They won't give up the rights.

1379
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,422
They don't want you
to remake Gone With The Wind.

1380
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:21,551
Well, then, I'll come up
with my own idea.

1381
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:23,754
They don't own the Civil War.

1382
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:25,490
I'm going to make this picture, David.

1383
01:13:25,564 --> 01:13:27,157
Then make it.

1384
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:29,327
You put up the dough.
You be the producer.

1385
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:30,835
You take the chances.

1386
01:13:30,904 --> 01:13:34,305
I'm sorry, kid. I'm out.

1387
01:13:34,374 --> 01:13:35,341
Come on.

1388
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:38,434
10, 9, 8,

1389
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:41,208
7, 6, 5...

1390
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:54,625
Happy New Year.

1391
01:13:54,695 --> 01:13:57,164
Happy New Year.

1392
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:59,132
The studio doesn't
want to make the movie.

1393
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,566
Why?

1394
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,661
I don't know, problems with the script,
problems with me.

1395
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,262
They don't think
a period piece will work.

1396
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,465
So, let them go. Who cares?

1397
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:06,838
Let them go?

1398
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:09,878
We don't have any financing.
We don't have a script.

1399
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,177
I knew you'd do something
to ruin my New Year's Eve.

1400
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,809
You can never just be happy, can you?

1401
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,479
You've always got to do something
to bring me down.

1402
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:21,615
Do you have to be so
goddamn narcissistic?

1403
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:24,990
You know how much
this movie means to me.

1404
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:29,432
I've wanted to play Scarlett O'Hara
ever since junior high.

1405
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:31,662
And I've already written half my songs.

1406
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:33,829
I know. I know.

1407
01:14:33,905 --> 01:14:35,202
What am I supposed to do?

1408
01:14:37,709 --> 01:14:39,973
Fix it, baby.

1409
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:47,042
I'll see you inside.

1410
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:52,955
For auld lang syne

1411
01:14:53,025 --> 01:14:59,590
Let old acquaintance be forgot

1412
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,997
I started spending

1413
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:03,935
more and more time with Maria,

1414
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,269
especially once my mom
started writing her book.

1415
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:09,901
She wrote nonstop
for the next six months.

1416
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:12,275
Where was your father all this time?

1417
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:17,584
Making his movie, Atlanta.

1418
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:22,216
I was only on the set of Atlanta once.

1419
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,724
That was more than enough.

1420
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,953
Excuse me. Make way.

1421
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:29,930
Make sure the reverend
has got his glasses.

1422
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,268
I don't think we've got enough flies.

1423
01:15:33,335 --> 01:15:35,326
These are dead men
in 100-degree heat.

1424
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:38,305
Albert, we've already got
every fly in the state working.

1425
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:40,501
What's that woman
in the carriage wearing?

1426
01:15:40,576 --> 01:15:41,804
What carriage?

1427
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:43,310
Back there.
What color is she wearing?

1428
01:15:43,379 --> 01:15:45,815
Pink? She can't wear pink.
Blake's wearing pink.

1429
01:15:45,883 --> 01:15:47,908
Jesus, Albert. Who's going to notice
what color she's wearing?

1430
01:15:47,985 --> 01:15:49,543
No one's going to even
notice the carriage.

1431
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,714
Unconsciously, the audience will know
the scene is just a little bit off.

1432
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:54,223
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1433
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:55,623
Uh, the wardrobe truck isn't here.

1434
01:15:55,693 --> 01:15:57,285
Well, we'll just have to wait for it.

1435
01:15:57,361 --> 01:15:58,658
Okay. Okay, Albert.

1436
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,162
This is why your budget has gone

1437
01:16:00,231 --> 01:16:02,325
from $9 million to $22 million

1438
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:03,891
in nine weeks.

1439
01:16:03,969 --> 01:16:05,630
You've have $40,000 worth of extras

1440
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:08,332
Iying around for two days
while you wait for the perfect sunset.

1441
01:16:08,407 --> 01:16:11,001
And now you want to change wardrobe

1442
01:16:11,076 --> 01:16:12,373
that nobody will ever see!

1443
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:13,911
You're turning on me now, too, huh?

1444
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:15,344
First the cameraman,
then the art director.

1445
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:16,939
I don't know what's
starting to happen here.

1446
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:18,244
Calm down. Calm down.

1447
01:16:18,318 --> 01:16:20,513
I sunk every dime I have
in this goddamn picture.

1448
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:21,917
- I know that.
- Every dime.

1449
01:16:21,988 --> 01:16:23,182
Albert, I know. I know.

1450
01:16:25,258 --> 01:16:26,953
Oh, God, I need a haircut.

1451
01:16:27,026 --> 01:16:28,220
Look, just change her dress, huh?

1452
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:29,454
Do that for me, please.

1453
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:31,258
Sure, sure.

1454
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:32,492
Amy!

1455
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:38,465
Run down there and throw a shawl
over that lady in the carriage.

1456
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:39,870
What carriage?

1457
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:42,969
The sun is going down. It's perfect.

1458
01:16:43,043 --> 01:16:44,510
Get them into positions.

1459
01:16:44,578 --> 01:16:46,239
This is what we've been waiting for.
Let's do it!

1460
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:48,714
Let's do it, people!
Take your places, please!

1461
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:50,250
Take your places on the double!

1462
01:16:50,318 --> 01:16:51,376
Places, please!

1463
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:52,784
Come on.

1464
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:08,433
Ready for rehearsal, Miss Amanda?

1465
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:09,836
In a minute.

1466
01:17:21,786 --> 01:17:24,254
I don't need a rehearsal.
Let's shoot it.

1467
01:17:24,322 --> 01:17:25,584
All right, stand by, people.

1468
01:17:25,656 --> 01:17:27,180
This will be picture.

1469
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:31,659
No drinking, no talking,
no laughing, no sneezing.

1470
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:32,991
Leave the horses alone.

1471
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:34,930
Keep the blood showing.
Let the blood show.

1472
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,594
All right,
ladies and gentlemen, this will be it.

1473
01:17:41,507 --> 01:17:43,134
Quiet, please! We're rolling!

1474
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,266
Rolling!

1475
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:45,901
Speed!

1476
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:48,573
Background action.

1477
01:17:48,648 --> 01:17:51,412
Horses. Smoke.

1478
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:52,815
Flies.

1479
01:17:56,055 --> 01:17:57,716
And action.

1480
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:02,786
"For as much as it
have pleased Almighty God

1481
01:18:02,862 --> 01:18:05,593
"in His wise providence
to take out of this world

1482
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:08,294
"the souls of our deceased brothers,

1483
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:11,964
"we therefore commit
their bodies to the ground.

1484
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:13,973
"Earth to earth,

1485
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:16,373
"ashes to ashes,

1486
01:18:16,444 --> 01:18:18,878
"dust to dust,

1487
01:18:18,946 --> 01:18:21,212
"looking for the general resurrection

1488
01:18:21,284 --> 01:18:22,717
"in the last day

1489
01:18:22,785 --> 01:18:24,776
"and the life of the world to come

1490
01:18:24,854 --> 01:18:28,119
through our Lord Jesus Christ."

1491
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:39,129
Come, Amanda,

1492
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:41,194
they need you.

1493
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,734
Amanda?

1494
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,503
No more.

1495
01:18:46,577 --> 01:18:47,544
No more bodies.

1496
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:50,239
I can't take it anymore.

1497
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:52,647
You mustn't say that, Amanda.

1498
01:18:57,355 --> 01:19:01,519
This civil war

1499
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:05,928
Ain't gonna get me down

1500
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:10,197
I'm movin' my act

1501
01:19:10,269 --> 01:19:15,002
To a brand-new town

1502
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:20,307
This belle got burned in old Atlanta

1503
01:19:20,379 --> 01:19:25,784
I'm gonna find myself
a brand-new Santa

1504
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:27,877
Cut!

1505
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,090
All right, get in here.

1506
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:34,422
Get the flies back.

1507
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:39,059
Darling, I'm the one
who's supposed to say cut.

1508
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:41,534
But, darling, apparently,
I'm the one that knows

1509
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:43,127
this scene isn't working.

1510
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:44,467
Somebody get me a Tab.

1511
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,837
If you want to yell at me, fine.

1512
01:19:45,908 --> 01:19:47,239
But don't do it in front of the crew.

1513
01:19:47,309 --> 01:19:48,606
It undermines my authority.

1514
01:19:48,677 --> 01:19:51,145
I thought this was
a Brodsky-Chandler production,

1515
01:19:51,213 --> 01:19:52,681
or don't I have a right to an opinion?

1516
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:54,649
Aren't I as bright as the great Lucy?

1517
01:19:54,717 --> 01:19:56,275
You don't always
have to put Lucy down.

1518
01:19:56,352 --> 01:19:57,683
We're losing the sun, folks.

1519
01:19:57,754 --> 01:19:59,915
Forget the sun!

1520
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:01,923
This Tab is warm. Damn it, Dotty!

1521
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:04,152
I'm sorry. It felt cold.

1522
01:20:04,227 --> 01:20:05,251
Well, it isn't.

1523
01:20:05,328 --> 01:20:06,727
For a thousand dollars a week, Mother,

1524
01:20:06,796 --> 01:20:09,595
I think you can learn the difference
between warm and cold.

1525
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:11,191
Give me the script.

1526
01:20:11,268 --> 01:20:12,496
If we don't get the shot right now,

1527
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,969
we're going to lose another whole day.

1528
01:20:14,038 --> 01:20:15,505
I know.

1529
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:16,835
What are you doing?

1530
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:18,772
The reason this scene doesn't work

1531
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:20,776
is because the lines
before the song don't work.

1532
01:20:20,844 --> 01:20:21,936
They're too down.

1533
01:20:22,012 --> 01:20:23,640
Amanda never has
anything funny to say.

1534
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:25,842
Nobody in this movie ever
has anything funny to say!

1535
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:29,080
That's because it's not a comedy.

1536
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,820
Okay, that's a wrap, folks!

1537
01:20:39,999 --> 01:20:41,830
God damn it, it's my money too!

1538
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:43,425
No, it is my money.

1539
01:20:43,502 --> 01:20:45,561
It is my life. It is my career, honey.

1540
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:47,230
You will go on and do lots of things.

1541
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:49,171
Not me. I will be buried with this.

1542
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,835
You might as well throw me
in that grave and bury me.

1543
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:55,815
Blake and my dad stayed together
until the movie opened.

1544
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:57,475
The night of the big premiere,

1545
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:01,852
Blake took off with her limo driver,
and we never saw her again.

1546
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,187
Atlanta lost more money

1547
01:21:04,258 --> 01:21:06,818
than any movie
in the history of movies,

1548
01:21:06,894 --> 01:21:08,020
or something like that.

1549
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,325
Right, Dad?

1550
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,468
My father had to declare--

1551
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,528
what do you call it
when you have no money?

1552
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:18,937
Bankruptcy?

1553
01:21:19,008 --> 01:21:21,841
Yeah. Bankruptcy.

1554
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,937
And what was your mother doing
while all this was going on?

1555
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:27,643
Finishing her book
and getting it published.

1556
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:30,515
Your mother's novel became
a big success, didn't it?

1557
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:32,578
Yeah, it did.

1558
01:21:32,656 --> 01:21:35,523
Then it was like
she became a new person.

1559
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:38,355
Who did she become?

1560
01:21:38,428 --> 01:21:40,795
Lucy Van Patten Brodsky.

1561
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:42,696
Hi, babe. How are you doing?

1562
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:46,029
Who, me? I'm great.

1563
01:21:46,103 --> 01:21:48,367
Hot as a pistol and free as a bird.

1564
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:50,373
How's the book going this week?

1565
01:21:50,441 --> 01:21:51,908
That's great.

1566
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:53,238
I'll take it.

1567
01:21:56,748 --> 01:21:58,147
Listen, honey, I'd love to talk,

1568
01:21:58,216 --> 01:21:59,877
but I'm in the middle of a meeting.

1569
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:01,384
That's okay.

1570
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:03,080
You, too.

1571
01:22:04,089 --> 01:22:05,420
Finished.

1572
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:10,526
Somebody pick up Casey
from the jerk's house?

1573
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:12,588
I just did. She's right over there.

1574
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,861
I had your car washed,
and your facial's at 5.

1575
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,061
How did Albert look?

1576
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:19,902
Bad. When I left, he was reading
Pauline Kael's review of Atlanta.

1577
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:20,997
Again?

1578
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:23,808
Do you have anything cold to drink?

1579
01:22:23,877 --> 01:22:25,071
I don't work here.

1580
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:28,282
Sorry.

1581
01:22:28,349 --> 01:22:31,182
Hi, Gorge. How are you doing?

1582
01:22:31,252 --> 01:22:33,220
Give me a kiss.

1583
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:36,713
Do you love me a lot?

1584
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:38,315
Luce?

1585
01:22:38,393 --> 01:22:40,258
Tonight Show, 1 8th.

1586
01:22:41,296 --> 01:22:43,094
Perfect.

1587
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:47,959
I thought we're going
to Palm Springs on the 1 8th.

1588
01:22:48,037 --> 01:22:50,767
You want me not to do
The Tonight Show?

1589
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,933
Where's my lunch?

1590
01:22:53,008 --> 01:22:55,374
It just arrived.

1591
01:22:56,645 --> 01:22:57,874
Tell Her Highness

1592
01:22:57,948 --> 01:23:00,314
I'm going across the street
to the bookstore.

1593
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:02,544
See if they've got me in the window.

1594
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,348
Tell them who you are.

1595
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:06,013
She's so moody lately.

1596
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:07,852
You should have heard
what the little wisenheimer

1597
01:23:07,924 --> 01:23:10,017
called me yesterday.

1598
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:13,359
Maybe I should take her to a shrink.

1599
01:23:13,431 --> 01:23:15,456
Maybe I should take me to a shrink.

1600
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,501
You've never looked better in your life.

1601
01:23:17,568 --> 01:23:18,694
Never.

1602
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,635
I'm feeling great, I am.

1603
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,072
Who's got a cigarette?

1604
01:23:24,142 --> 01:23:26,406
...director Albert Brodsky.

1605
01:23:26,477 --> 01:23:28,106
What's that?

1606
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:29,978
What?

1607
01:23:30,049 --> 01:23:32,415
The news. Turn it up.

1608
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:34,817
Brodsky collapsed in his Bel Air home

1609
01:23:34,888 --> 01:23:37,049
and was rushed to Wilshire Memorial.

1610
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:39,648
The 38 year-old film director
achieved notoriety

1611
01:23:39,726 --> 01:23:42,058
with his first film, An American Romance,

1612
01:23:42,128 --> 01:23:44,256
but was best known for his disastrous

1613
01:23:44,331 --> 01:23:47,528
$35 million megaflop, Atlanta.

1614
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:49,262
What happened? Is he dead?

1615
01:23:52,406 --> 01:23:53,668
Who are you?

1616
01:23:53,741 --> 01:23:55,003
I'm his wife.

1617
01:23:55,075 --> 01:23:56,167
What happened?

1618
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:57,505
Cardiac arrest.

1619
01:23:57,578 --> 01:23:59,945
He-- He had a heart attack?

1620
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:01,642
He's 38 years old.

1621
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:03,240
1/8 grain of morphine, Colleen.

1622
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,081
Yes, doctor.

1623
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:07,883
Can you-- can you hear me?

1624
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,448
Oh, Albert.

1625
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:12,857
God, you've got to get better.

1626
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,126
We can't end like this, huh?

1627
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,723
I never--

1628
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,234
I always thought we--

1629
01:24:20,303 --> 01:24:21,531
Oh, God.

1630
01:24:21,604 --> 01:24:24,334
Turn the oxygen up to 4 liters.

1631
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:29,102
I could never bring myself
to tell you this before,

1632
01:24:29,178 --> 01:24:32,945
but I saw Atlanta.

1633
01:24:33,016 --> 01:24:34,176
Albert!

1634
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:37,550
I knew what you were going for. I did.

1635
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:39,680
I thought you had some of
the most beautiful moments

1636
01:24:39,756 --> 01:24:41,986
I'd ever seen on film.

1637
01:24:42,059 --> 01:24:43,617
Really.

1638
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:46,825
What are you doing?

1639
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:48,093
Is he going to die?

1640
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,725
I'd say from the looks of his EKG,

1641
01:24:49,802 --> 01:24:51,201
not for another 40 years.

1642
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:53,500
Your husband didn't have
a heart attack, Mrs. Brodsky.

1643
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:55,631
He had an anxiety attack.

1644
01:24:58,978 --> 01:25:00,275
From that moment on,

1645
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:02,008
things got worse and worse,

1646
01:25:02,082 --> 01:25:03,743
especially for me.

1647
01:25:03,817 --> 01:25:06,809
My mom refused to have
anything to do with my dad.

1648
01:25:06,887 --> 01:25:08,286
It got to the point

1649
01:25:08,355 --> 01:25:11,051
where they wouldn't
even speak to each other.

1650
01:25:11,124 --> 01:25:13,217
Daddy wants to know--

1651
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:16,924
I told you never to mention his name.

1652
01:25:16,998 --> 01:25:19,330
You-know-who wants to know
if he can see me

1653
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,731
on Saturday instead of Friday.

1654
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:22,291
Out of the question.

1655
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:25,305
Tell him if he can't stick to the rules,
he can't see you.

1656
01:25:25,373 --> 01:25:26,601
Will you tell your mother

1657
01:25:26,674 --> 01:25:27,971
I've got unemployment on Friday?

1658
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:29,304
Can't she bend a little bit?

1659
01:25:29,377 --> 01:25:31,846
Jesus, what's the big deal?

1660
01:25:31,914 --> 01:25:33,939
Tell your father the big deal

1661
01:25:34,016 --> 01:25:36,280
is that he has to start
working around me!

1662
01:25:36,351 --> 01:25:38,751
I'm calling the shots now.

1663
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:42,785
Tell your mother
I'm not one of her flunkies.

1664
01:25:42,858 --> 01:25:44,018
She can go f--

1665
01:25:45,193 --> 01:25:49,028
Tell your father he just lost
visiting privileges for a month.

1666
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:55,033
Maybe I should skip
seeing you this week.

1667
01:25:56,039 --> 01:25:57,370
You sure?

1668
01:25:58,508 --> 01:26:00,942
Yeah, it'll be easier.

1669
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:05,178
Well, good luck in your new home.

1670
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,616
Yeah. You, too.

1671
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:25,002
Okay, guys.

1672
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:26,095
Don't soil it, all right?

1673
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:27,696
We're talking gray flannel here.

1674
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:29,172
You get my drift?

1675
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:31,766
Leon, sweetheart, gently, ever so gently.

1676
01:26:31,844 --> 01:26:33,745
I'll love you forever.

1677
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,839
I couldn't believe it.

1678
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,941
My mom bought my dad's house,

1679
01:26:38,018 --> 01:26:41,454
and my dad moved into
a place he could afford.

1680
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:47,855
How long can a meeting go on,
for Christ's sake?

1681
01:26:47,928 --> 01:26:50,022
I've been trying
to reach him for days.

1682
01:26:50,098 --> 01:26:51,861
I don't believe this. Hello?

1683
01:26:54,702 --> 01:26:56,192
Casey, come here.

1684
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,534
I want you to say you're
Robert Redford's secretary.

1685
01:26:58,606 --> 01:27:00,699
I think my agent's trying to avoid me.

1686
01:27:00,775 --> 01:27:02,640
Okay, it's ringing. Come here.

1687
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,235
Dad.

1688
01:27:04,313 --> 01:27:05,746
Sound like an adult.

1689
01:27:05,814 --> 01:27:08,544
Hi. Is he in?

1690
01:27:08,617 --> 01:27:11,211
It's Robert Redford calling.

1691
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:13,015
Hello, Sandy?

1692
01:27:13,088 --> 01:27:15,818
Hello, Sandy? It's me, Albert.

1693
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:17,188
Why are you doing this to--

1694
01:27:18,994 --> 01:27:20,327
Oh, God.

1695
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:26,933
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.

1696
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:39,112
You know, you're starting to look
more and more like your mother.

1697
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:42,746
How is your mother?

1698
01:27:42,821 --> 01:27:44,220
Okay.

1699
01:27:46,324 --> 01:27:47,586
She ever talk about me?

1700
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:49,820
Well, not too much anymore.

1701
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,796
I mean, I think she still hates you,

1702
01:27:51,864 --> 01:27:54,094
but she's been real busy lately.

1703
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:55,998
They're making her book
into a movie, you know.

1704
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:59,061
Oh, yeah? That's great.

1705
01:27:59,138 --> 01:28:02,301
She doesn't think I'm still
hung up on Blake, does she?

1706
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,366
I mean, you know I'm not.

1707
01:28:04,444 --> 01:28:06,436
You could tell your mom if you wanted to.

1708
01:28:06,513 --> 01:28:07,844
I wouldn't mind.

1709
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:18,123
Boy, this looks fabulous.

1710
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,126
Where'd you learn to make enchiladas?

1711
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,457
From Maria.

1712
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:22,791
Maria.

1713
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:25,355
How is Maria, anyway?

1714
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,627
Fine.

1715
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:29,067
Does she ever ask about me?

1716
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:36,271
Hey, Case,

1717
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,474
what do you think of your old man?

1718
01:28:39,549 --> 01:28:41,073
Be honest.

1719
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:42,982
Daddy, you know, for a long time,

1720
01:28:43,053 --> 01:28:46,147
you didn't talk to me so much
because you were always so busy.

1721
01:28:46,223 --> 01:28:49,283
And now it's like you want me
to be your best friend or something.

1722
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:50,417
It's not fair.

1723
01:28:50,494 --> 01:28:52,429
Fair? You want to talk fair?

1724
01:28:52,497 --> 01:28:54,795
Two Academy Award nominations,
and look at me.

1725
01:28:54,866 --> 01:28:57,357
I can't even get arrested.

1726
01:29:05,776 --> 01:29:09,008
You always read
when you eat with your mom?

1727
01:29:09,081 --> 01:29:10,548
I don't eat with my mom.

1728
01:29:10,616 --> 01:29:12,880
What are you reading?

1729
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:14,441
Tomorrow.

1730
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,748
Can I see it, please?

1731
01:29:23,596 --> 01:29:27,088
"Erica James celebrated
her 1 5th birthday

1732
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:29,692
by screwing
the entire junior varsity basketball team."

1733
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:31,031
What is this?

1734
01:29:31,104 --> 01:29:33,834
A book. May I have it, please?

1735
01:29:33,907 --> 01:29:35,841
No. I don't want you
reading books like this.

1736
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:37,672
You can't tell me what to do.

1737
01:29:37,744 --> 01:29:39,508
Oh, yes I can. I'm your father.

1738
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,172
No, you're not.

1739
01:29:41,248 --> 01:29:43,239
You don't pay child support anymore.

1740
01:30:34,005 --> 01:30:38,442
Mom, do you still love Daddy?

1741
01:30:38,509 --> 01:30:41,604
Why are you doing this to me?

1742
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,241
This is the first chance
I've had to relax all week.

1743
01:30:45,317 --> 01:30:47,285
I'm sorry.

1744
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:50,151
Want to go out to a movie
tonight or something?

1745
01:30:52,191 --> 01:30:53,920
Get that, will you, baby?

1746
01:30:53,993 --> 01:30:55,221
Say I'm not here.

1747
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:03,061
Hello?

1748
01:31:03,136 --> 01:31:06,663
No, this is Casey, her daughter.

1749
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,230
No, she's out.

1750
01:31:11,044 --> 01:31:13,071
Okay, I'll tell her.

1751
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:14,513
Bye.

1752
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,812
That was your publisher.

1753
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:18,147
She wanted you to know

1754
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,619
your book just reached number 1.

1755
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:24,123
You're kidding.

1756
01:31:24,192 --> 01:31:27,924
I wrote the number 1
bestseller in the country?

1757
01:31:27,997 --> 01:31:30,431
My God, I'm huge.

1758
01:31:34,804 --> 01:31:36,897
Oh, God.

1759
01:31:40,677 --> 01:31:42,543
Get right in here. You are going to die.

1760
01:31:42,613 --> 01:31:43,875
Where's Howard?

1761
01:31:43,947 --> 01:31:46,507
Well, tell him to come in here.

1762
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,016
Maria! Come in here.

1763
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:49,017
Oh, wait. Where's lnez?

1764
01:31:50,688 --> 01:31:52,553
- Who's lnez?
- She's the cook.

1765
01:31:52,623 --> 01:31:55,854
I hired a cook. You hate my cooking.

1766
01:31:55,926 --> 01:31:57,519
No, I don't.

1767
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,562
I just got a call from New York.

1768
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,969
He said It Was Going To Be Forever

1769
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:09,472
is number 1!

1770
01:32:12,077 --> 01:32:13,443
What is?

1771
01:32:13,512 --> 01:32:14,672
Her book.

1772
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:17,209
Congratulations.

1773
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:18,773
Thank you very much.

1774
01:32:19,819 --> 01:32:21,980
God, Lucy, that's super.

1775
01:32:23,889 --> 01:32:26,357
I thought you'd all want to know.

1776
01:32:28,796 --> 01:32:31,390
You were here
when it was happening.

1777
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:32,797
Well, not you, lnez, you're new.

1778
01:32:32,867 --> 01:32:35,301
But you'll be here for the next one.

1779
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:38,237
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

1780
01:32:38,306 --> 01:32:40,297
You're very welcome.

1781
01:32:42,977 --> 01:32:44,138
Thanks for coming in.

1782
01:32:44,213 --> 01:32:45,441
You don't have to stay, thanks.

1783
01:33:16,113 --> 01:33:17,774
Who is it?

1784
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:19,509
It's me, Albert.

1785
01:33:22,553 --> 01:33:24,714
It's not your visiting day.

1786
01:33:24,789 --> 01:33:27,121
I know. Can I come in?

1787
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,795
Hi.

1788
01:33:37,335 --> 01:33:39,565
What do you want?

1789
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,808
The place looks really nice.

1790
01:33:48,882 --> 01:33:50,144
Great.

1791
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:54,017
Hey, I read your book finally.

1792
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,349
It's very well written.

1793
01:33:56,557 --> 01:33:58,115
It had some very funny things in it.

1794
01:33:58,192 --> 01:34:00,319
I laughed a lot.

1795
01:34:00,394 --> 01:34:01,760
I cried, too.

1796
01:34:03,531 --> 01:34:05,761
Well, I did, when they broke up.

1797
01:34:05,834 --> 01:34:07,324
I kept thinking back in the beginning

1798
01:34:07,402 --> 01:34:10,303
when they were young and on the road

1799
01:34:10,371 --> 01:34:12,566
and how tragic everything turned out.

1800
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,403
It's a good book, Lucy. It really is.

1801
01:34:14,476 --> 01:34:15,966
Thank you. What do you want?

1802
01:34:16,044 --> 01:34:17,637
I mean, you did bury me there,

1803
01:34:17,713 --> 01:34:20,511
but thank God
you changed the names.

1804
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:23,711
It wasn't to protect
the innocent, I assure you.

1805
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:26,311
I know you could care less,
but I want you to know

1806
01:34:26,388 --> 01:34:30,154
that I realize how nuts
I was there with Blake.

1807
01:34:30,226 --> 01:34:32,855
I didn't know if I was coming or going.

1808
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:34,692
I want you to know how sorry I am.

1809
01:34:34,764 --> 01:34:37,028
I feel badly about the way
I treated you and Casey.

1810
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,431
So do we.

1811
01:34:40,303 --> 01:34:43,101
I realized today I don't even know
my own daughter anymore.

1812
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:46,575
Gee, maybe you should have
thought about all of this

1813
01:34:46,643 --> 01:34:48,339
when you were lighting
Sarah Bernhardt's cigarette.

1814
01:34:48,412 --> 01:34:51,643
Are we ever going to be able
to talk like people, Lucy?

1815
01:34:51,716 --> 01:34:54,378
I don't think so.

1816
01:34:57,588 --> 01:35:00,455
Look, I've got to get back to work.
I've got a deadline.

1817
01:35:01,826 --> 01:35:03,295
Need any help?

1818
01:35:03,363 --> 01:35:05,422
No, thanks.

1819
01:35:06,432 --> 01:35:09,595
Okay, okay. I'm going.

1820
01:35:09,669 --> 01:35:11,534
Could I just say hello to Case? I--

1821
01:35:11,604 --> 01:35:13,765
We had a fight, and l'd
like to make up with her.

1822
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,808
I'd like to apologize.

1823
01:35:15,875 --> 01:35:17,604
She's in her room.

1824
01:35:17,677 --> 01:35:19,578
Can I go up?

1825
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:33,122
- She's not up there.
- Yes, she is.

1826
01:35:33,193 --> 01:35:34,684
Casey!

1827
01:35:36,331 --> 01:35:40,062
Well, she probably fell asleep
watching television.

1828
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:48,003
Casey!

1829
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:55,448
Well, I thought I saw her here earlier.

1830
01:35:55,518 --> 01:35:56,951
What do you mean,
you thought you saw her?

1831
01:35:57,019 --> 01:35:59,453
Don't yell at me.

1832
01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:02,355
Now where is she?
She always tells me when she goes out.

1833
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:04,416
God, what if she's been kidnapped?

1834
01:36:04,494 --> 01:36:06,223
I should get a burglar alarm.

1835
01:36:06,296 --> 01:36:08,628
I should get one of those
armed guards to live in.

1836
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:11,361
I keep getting these weird letters
from people all over the country.

1837
01:36:11,435 --> 01:36:14,495
- Lucy, where's Casey?
- I don't know.

1838
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:16,004
Ask Maria.

1839
01:36:16,073 --> 01:36:17,973
Where's Maria?

1840
01:36:26,485 --> 01:36:28,419
Mr. Albert, Miss Lucy.

1841
01:36:28,487 --> 01:36:29,977
Maria, is Casey here?

1842
01:36:30,055 --> 01:36:31,920
Yes.

1843
01:36:31,991 --> 01:36:34,585
She said she told you she was coming.

1844
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,094
She did?

1845
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:38,824
I don't remember.
What's she doing here?

1846
01:36:38,898 --> 01:36:40,832
She's sleeping.

1847
01:36:52,113 --> 01:36:54,172
Why is she here? I don't get it.

1848
01:36:54,248 --> 01:36:57,240
I bring her here sometimes
when you travel with your book.

1849
01:36:57,318 --> 01:36:59,684
She likes to play with my kids.

1850
01:37:01,956 --> 01:37:04,516
Well, I'm taking her home.
She doesn't have to stay tonight.

1851
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:06,424
Let her sleep, Miss Lucy.

1852
01:37:06,495 --> 01:37:07,928
She needs a rest.

1853
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:10,226
Let the child alone.

1854
01:37:13,268 --> 01:37:15,736
She's okay.

1855
01:37:15,804 --> 01:37:18,272
She's sleeping good.

1856
01:37:22,445 --> 01:37:24,379
You interested in having a drink?

1857
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:27,382
- No. I'm depressed.
- Well, I'm going to have one.

1858
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:30,248
- Bye.
- Bye.

1859
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:32,310
Come on. One drink.

1860
01:38:42,397 --> 01:38:45,798
I can't believe we did this.

1861
01:38:45,868 --> 01:38:48,029
You're not sorry, are you?

1862
01:38:48,103 --> 01:38:50,298
I don't know yet.

1863
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,803
It's so weird being with you again.

1864
01:39:00,584 --> 01:39:02,779
And it's not weird at all.

1865
01:39:05,122 --> 01:39:07,181
You know what I mean?

1866
01:39:07,258 --> 01:39:09,317
Want me to be honest with you?

1867
01:39:09,393 --> 01:39:14,297
I just never remember it
being this great.

1868
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:16,459
I don't know who you've been with, but--

1869
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:19,868
Nobody.

1870
01:39:21,406 --> 01:39:23,431
Nobody?

1871
01:39:23,508 --> 01:39:27,104
Well, at first I just couldn't. I--

1872
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,308
And then, you may recall,
I put on a few extra pounds.

1873
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:34,916
Lately, I've just been too busy.

1874
01:39:34,987 --> 01:39:39,981
Sometimes I can't believe
how things have changed.

1875
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:44,488
Casey told me they're making
your book into a movie.

1876
01:39:44,565 --> 01:39:46,430
Yeah, that's another thing.

1877
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,866
You know, they wanted it,
like, yesterday.

1878
01:39:48,936 --> 01:39:50,369
Well, how far into it are you?

1879
01:39:50,437 --> 01:39:52,371
I'm almost finished.

1880
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:57,036
Of course, I've been almost finished
for the last month.

1881
01:39:57,111 --> 01:39:58,942
- Who's going to direct it?
- I don't know.

1882
01:39:59,013 --> 01:40:00,640
We haven't decided yet.

1883
01:40:00,715 --> 01:40:02,706
Well, who are you leaning towards?

1884
01:40:02,784 --> 01:40:04,217
Nobody yet. I--

1885
01:40:04,285 --> 01:40:07,413
I don't want to talk about this now.

1886
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:10,286
I think I'd be good for the job, Lucy.

1887
01:40:10,358 --> 01:40:12,453
I know your point of view, obviously,

1888
01:40:12,529 --> 01:40:14,759
and at one time, I think you thought
I was a pretty good director.

1889
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:19,325
If I remember correctly, you were one
of the few who appreciated Atlanta.

1890
01:40:19,402 --> 01:40:21,495
I think I'm perfect for the job.

1891
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:23,129
How do you feel about it?

1892
01:40:23,206 --> 01:40:24,764
Get out of my bed!

1893
01:40:25,976 --> 01:40:28,309
How can I let him do this to me?

1894
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:30,404
You are a repulsive human being!

1895
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:32,779
You are the reason women hate men!

1896
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:36,377
I knew were you low.
I knew you were mean and insincere.

1897
01:40:36,454 --> 01:40:40,686
I had no idea
how inhumane you could be!

1898
01:40:40,758 --> 01:40:42,693
Crawling into my bed, using me!

1899
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:44,023
You look like a rat!

1900
01:40:46,131 --> 01:40:47,792
I want you out of my house!

1901
01:40:47,866 --> 01:40:49,959
You're all confused.

1902
01:40:50,035 --> 01:40:51,366
I wanted to make love to you.

1903
01:40:51,436 --> 01:40:53,336
I've fantasized about it, Lucy, I swear.

1904
01:40:53,405 --> 01:40:55,532
What, do you think
I came here last night

1905
01:40:55,607 --> 01:40:57,872
hoping that we'd make love
so that I could ask you for a job?

1906
01:40:57,944 --> 01:41:00,378
Are you nuts?
I swear to God I'm innocent!

1907
01:41:01,614 --> 01:41:02,876
I'm calling the police.

1908
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:05,213
I'm sweating. Oh, my God!

1909
01:41:05,285 --> 01:41:07,310
I feel like Henry Fonda in The Wrong Man.

1910
01:41:07,387 --> 01:41:09,378
I'm going to throw you out that window!

1911
01:41:17,064 --> 01:41:19,999
God help me! You lunatic!

1912
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:22,865
I wish I'd never met you.

1913
01:41:22,937 --> 01:41:25,098
I should've let you
drown on that highway!

1914
01:41:25,172 --> 01:41:26,935
I'd be happy today,
living in Pittsburgh.

1915
01:41:27,007 --> 01:41:28,497
Nobody's happy living in Pittsburgh.

1916
01:41:28,575 --> 01:41:30,101
I hate you!

1917
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:31,612
You should stop hating me for a minute

1918
01:41:31,681 --> 01:41:33,512
and take a look at yourself, Miss Macho.

1919
01:41:33,582 --> 01:41:35,209
Miss Genius Perfect Person
who has no idea

1920
01:41:35,284 --> 01:41:36,876
where her 9-year-old daughter is sleeping.

1921
01:41:36,953 --> 01:41:39,683
Oh, well, it didn't seem
to bother you earlier, worm.

1922
01:41:39,755 --> 01:41:41,620
No, you were too busy getting me drunk

1923
01:41:41,691 --> 01:41:43,818
so you could screw me
and ask for a job, weren't you?

1924
01:41:43,893 --> 01:41:45,828
How about dealing with the fact
that your 9-year-old daughter

1925
01:41:45,896 --> 01:41:48,364
would rather sleep at the maid's
than in the same house with you?

1926
01:41:48,432 --> 01:41:50,764
Yeah. You turned out to be quite
a mother, didn't you, Lucy?

1927
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:52,426
You got a secretary to take her to school.

1928
01:41:52,502 --> 01:41:54,333
You got a secretary
to take her to dance class.

1929
01:41:54,404 --> 01:41:56,634
You got Maria to put her to bed,
the cook to give her breakfast.

1930
01:41:56,707 --> 01:41:58,140
Who gives her love?
Yuki the gardener?

1931
01:42:04,248 --> 01:42:07,274
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1932
01:42:08,686 --> 01:42:10,950
Albert, put me down!
Put me down!

1933
01:42:15,627 --> 01:42:19,791
Don't you ever criticize me
as a parent!

1934
01:42:19,865 --> 01:42:21,958
Why, goddess? Because a man
hurts a woman once,

1935
01:42:22,034 --> 01:42:24,127
does that allow her to become a barracuda
for the rest of her life?

1936
01:42:24,203 --> 01:42:25,602
Holier than thou from that moment on!

1937
01:42:25,671 --> 01:42:28,105
Don't you take responsibility
for anything in your own life?

1938
01:42:28,173 --> 01:42:29,401
You want to know something, Lucy?

1939
01:42:29,475 --> 01:42:31,467
Seeing what you've turned into
just breaks my heart!

1940
01:42:31,544 --> 01:42:35,412
I'll break your heart!
You want to know how, Albert?

1941
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:38,849
I'm never going
to let you see your daughter again.

1942
01:42:38,918 --> 01:42:41,512
How's that for a broken heart, pal?

1943
01:42:44,257 --> 01:42:47,194
This child isn't going to know
she has a father after today.

1944
01:42:47,262 --> 01:42:49,253
Take a good look,
because she's out of your life forever.

1945
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:51,561
- Oh, yeah?
- What are you guys doing?

1946
01:42:51,633 --> 01:42:53,294
Maria, call the police!

1947
01:42:53,368 --> 01:42:54,995
Let go of her!
I'm taking her away from you!

1948
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,504
Try it, and I'll have you
arrested for kidnapping!

1949
01:42:57,572 --> 01:42:58,971
Oh, you're deep in, baby!

1950
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:00,975
Don't call me baby!

1951
01:43:01,043 --> 01:43:03,808
Leave me alone!

1952
01:43:05,348 --> 01:43:08,112
They let go of me.
My mom started to cry.

1953
01:43:08,184 --> 01:43:10,379
My dad got in his car and drove off.

1954
01:43:10,453 --> 01:43:14,822
I was just standing there all by myself.

1955
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:17,224
That's when I ran away,

1956
01:43:17,294 --> 01:43:19,922
and that's how come I ended up here.

1957
01:43:23,901 --> 01:43:25,835
I have no further questions.

1958
01:43:27,838 --> 01:43:31,239
You may step down now, Casey.

1959
01:43:39,584 --> 01:43:42,348
Can I say something else,
though, before I go?

1960
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:43,614
Your Honor?

1961
01:43:47,392 --> 01:43:48,724
Sure.

1962
01:43:52,298 --> 01:43:54,732
I'd like to be honest with you, okay?

1963
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,392
Okay.

1964
01:43:59,805 --> 01:44:03,573
The reason I went to a lawyer
to divorce my parents

1965
01:44:03,644 --> 01:44:07,045
is because I can't take living
with either one of them anymore.

1966
01:44:07,115 --> 01:44:10,050
And please, don't switch
custody around or anything,

1967
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:12,086
because that won't help.

1968
01:44:12,153 --> 01:44:15,122
I want you to know I don't expect my mom

1969
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:17,589
to be a person who vacuums all day,

1970
01:44:17,658 --> 01:44:20,822
bakes cookies for me
when I get home from school.

1971
01:44:20,896 --> 01:44:25,196
And I don't expect my dad to be some kind
of real understanding person,

1972
01:44:25,267 --> 01:44:28,998
puts me on his knee,
wants to take me fishing all the time.

1973
01:44:29,071 --> 01:44:32,802
But my mom and dad are just too mixed up
for anybody to be around.

1974
01:44:34,377 --> 01:44:36,004
I'm just a kid,

1975
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:40,015
and I don't know
what I'm doing sometimes.

1976
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:42,677
But I think you should know better
when you're all grown up.

1977
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,617
I think you should know how to act,

1978
01:44:44,687 --> 01:44:47,121
how to treat people.

1979
01:44:47,190 --> 01:44:50,718
I think if you once loved someone
enough to marry them,

1980
01:44:50,794 --> 01:44:52,819
you should at least be nice to them,

1981
01:44:52,897 --> 01:44:54,956
even if you don't love them anymore.

1982
01:44:55,032 --> 01:44:57,523
And I think if you have a child,

1983
01:44:57,601 --> 01:45:01,833
you should treat that child
like a human being and not like a pet.

1984
01:45:01,906 --> 01:45:05,365
Not like you treat your dog or something.

1985
01:45:05,443 --> 01:45:06,774
You know, when you have a dog,

1986
01:45:06,845 --> 01:45:10,008
sometimes you forget he's there.

1987
01:45:10,081 --> 01:45:12,572
Then when you get lonely,
suddenly you remember him,

1988
01:45:12,651 --> 01:45:14,710
and you remember how cute he is

1989
01:45:14,786 --> 01:45:18,085
and stuff, and you kiss him a lot.

1990
01:45:18,156 --> 01:45:20,285
But then the next day
when you're busy again,

1991
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,351
you don't notice him.

1992
01:45:23,897 --> 01:45:26,593
That's how I've been treated
for the past four years.

1993
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:29,431
You don't treat your kid like your dog.

1994
01:45:29,503 --> 01:45:31,266
It's not right.

1995
01:45:31,338 --> 01:45:34,171
I want to live
with Maria Hernandez...

1996
01:45:34,241 --> 01:45:36,642
full time.

1997
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:40,545
She said I could. I want you to let me.

1998
01:45:40,615 --> 01:45:43,709
I think I'll be okay without
a real mother and father.

1999
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:49,088
I have been for a long time.

2000
01:45:49,157 --> 01:45:50,988
That's it.

2001
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:49,178
Hi, Henry. Hi, Lindabelle.

2002
01:46:49,255 --> 01:46:51,485
- Hi, Miss Lucy.
- Hi, missus.

2003
01:46:54,328 --> 01:46:55,590
Hi.

2004
01:46:55,663 --> 01:46:57,631
- Hi.
- Hi.

2005
01:47:00,934 --> 01:47:03,630
Mom, how come you're here today?

2006
01:47:04,772 --> 01:47:07,468
Oh, God, is it your visiting day?

2007
01:47:07,541 --> 01:47:09,635
Well, I think so.
You were here last weekend, weren't you?

2008
01:47:09,711 --> 01:47:11,576
Was it last week?

2009
01:47:16,017 --> 01:47:17,507
I'm sorry.

2010
01:47:20,055 --> 01:47:23,024
Gee-- Oh, God.

2011
01:47:25,294 --> 01:47:26,761
Maria here?

2012
01:47:26,829 --> 01:47:28,057
No. She's working.

2013
01:47:30,299 --> 01:47:32,096
Well, I'll see you guys.

2014
01:47:32,168 --> 01:47:35,660
I can't believe I did this.
I'm really sorry.

2015
01:47:35,738 --> 01:47:37,672
Listen, we were about to get
something to eat.

2016
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:40,005
Would you like to come along?

2017
01:47:40,077 --> 01:47:42,136
No. No, no. You two go ahead.

2018
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:44,146
Why don't you, Mom?

2019
01:47:44,214 --> 01:47:47,081
- You don't mind?
- No, I don't mind.

2020
01:47:49,019 --> 01:47:50,646
Should I follow you in my car?

2021
01:47:50,721 --> 01:47:52,916
We can take mine.

2022
01:47:52,989 --> 01:47:54,856
Okay. Great.

2023
01:48:00,232 --> 01:48:01,961
Bye, Theresa!

2024
01:48:06,972 --> 01:48:10,204
- I'll get in the back.
- Oh, okay.

2025
01:48:17,817 --> 01:48:19,785
When did you get this?

2026
01:48:19,853 --> 01:48:21,548
A couple of weeks ago.

2027
01:48:21,621 --> 01:48:22,883
I like it.

2028
01:48:22,956 --> 01:48:24,821
Watch this. Now?

2029
01:48:24,891 --> 01:48:26,723
Okay, go.

2030
01:48:28,896 --> 01:48:30,921
Hey, great.

2031
01:48:52,654 --> 01:48:53,746
Looks crowded.

2032
01:48:53,822 --> 01:48:56,052
I'll go inside and check it out.

2033
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:05,130
You want a cigarette?

2034
01:49:05,201 --> 01:49:06,725
No, thanks.

2035
01:49:06,803 --> 01:49:08,498
Neither do l.

2036
01:49:14,712 --> 01:49:16,509
They can take us!

2037
01:49:16,581 --> 01:49:18,173
Wait right there. I'm gonna park.

2038
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:47,503
Well, what's everybody
going to have?

2039
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:48,707
I don't know.

2040
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:50,181
I'm having a hamburger, fries,

2041
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,741
a Coke, and maybe a salad.
How about you, Luce?
