1
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,435
Anybody hungry?

2
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:40,135
Didn't think so.
Just kidding.

3
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,935
Okay, fellas, food time.
Burt, liver, no onions.

4
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:51,535
Here you go, Burtie.
And, for dessert...

5
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,535
There you go.

6
00:02:55,135 --> 00:03:00,835
Connie, Mack, you kids wanted the tuna,
hold the mayo. Lovely choice.

7
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:05,135
Here you go. I'm not crazy
about you two living together.

8
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:09,935
Marvin, you ordered the flounder.
I didn't like the way it looked...

9
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:16,235
...so I prepared a little something
special for you. I think you'll like this.

10
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:21,035
Maybe not.
Okay, here we go.

11
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:25,735
- Polly, get that for me, would you?
- All right.

12
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,935
Kelly's Pet Shop. Polly speaking.
It's your mother, Johnny.

13
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:35,335
- Tell her to hold, would you?
- Hang on.

14
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:39,035
Thanks, Pol. Hi, Ma.

15
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,835
Not too much.
I'm just feeding some of the animals.

16
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:47,535
Yeah, sure. It's probably just
the weather. Don't worry about it.

17
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,835
Probably get better tomorrow.

18
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:54,935
Maybe if you wouldn't drink so much,
the whole thing would clear up.

19
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,335
I'll see you later.

20
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:02,135
All right, come here.
Hand it over.

21
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:06,335
- What the hell was that noise?
- It was this little gadget.

22
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:09,035
Something I came up with.
Prevents stealing.

23
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,235
- Stops guys like you.
- Go ahead, call the cops.

24
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:16,235
- Let's get this over with.
- Pretty tough, huh?

25
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:19,135
- Tough enough.
- Yeah? You like stealing?

26
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,235
- Beats paying for it.
- You think stealing makes you big?

27
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:27,835
Bigger than you, wearing an apron
and feeding a bunch of monkeys.

28
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:33,235
- I'll tell you where stealing gets you.
- Wake me when you're through.

29
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:38,835
You know, I started out just like you, kid.
It must have been 25 years ago.

30
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,235
- What's going on?
- Don't worry. It'll end in a few minutes.

31
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:46,135
It always does this when I talk
about the past. It was 1910.

32
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,735
Times were good in America.
Plenty of everything:

33
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,535
Jobs, security, laughs.

34
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:59,035
America was in great shape,
except for President William Howard Taft.

35
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:04,835
Was he a porker. He weighed as much
as Teddy Roosevelt and half of McKinley.

36
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:10,235
immigrants poured in from all over
the world, looking for a better life.

37
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:16,035
Over 97 percent of them settled
in a two-block area of New York City.

38
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:20,935
There was a law that said that
immigrants who wanted citizenship...

39
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:25,935
...had to stay out of their apartments and
walk around the streets with hats on.

40
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,535
Most didn't find streets
paved with gold.

41
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:37,035
instead, they found hard times. Nobody
had it tougher than my mom, Mom Kelly.

42
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:42,235
She was kind and sweet.
She had a colorful way of putting things.

43
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:48,135
The Lower East Side,
this really sucks.

44
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,035
I was your age and just
starting out in business.

45
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,935
Hey, kid, you got a paper?

46
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,835
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, Johnny.

47
00:05:56,135 --> 00:06:00,735
- Your pancreas feeling better?
- Now don't you go worrying about me.

48
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04,235
- You just keep yourself warm.
- Thanks, Mom.

49
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:07,935
Oh, God, it's the worst July in years.

50
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:12,435
You go on upstairs. As soon as I
sell these, we'll celebrate your birthday.

51
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:15,135
You're my darling boy.

52
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:18,135
Hey, kid, paper here.
- Yeah.

53
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,335
All right, Tribune. Get your Tribune.
Get your Tribune.

54
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:35,035
Tribune. Get your Tribune.
One lousy penny.

55
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:42,935
- One lousy penny. Get your Tribune.
Hey, this is my corner.

56
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,535
- Danny Vermin don't move for nobody.
- Oh, yeah?

57
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:50,935
Yeah. It's okay, officer,
I can handle this myself.

58
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:58,735
- Stop the car, Arthur. I wanna see this.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Dundee.

59
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:08,935
- No hard feelings.
- You ain't seen the last of Danny Vermin.

60
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:13,835
Hey, kid. Come here.

61
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,835
- I like the way you handle yourself.
- Thanks, mister.

62
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,935
Do you know who this man is?

63
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:27,535
- I give up.
- How'd you like to make a 50?

64
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,235
Do I have to break the law?

65
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:36,135
If I broke the law, it'd be
like breaking my mother's heart.

66
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:40,035
Okay, kid.
But if you change your mind...

67
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:44,735
...I’ll be at the Club 25.

68
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:25,035
- Dr. Magnus? How's my mother?
- It's her pancreas. I need to operate.

69
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,735
- How much is it gonna cost?
- $49.95.

70
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,235
- $49.95?
- This week only.

71
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:35,035
- Where can I get that kind of money?
- Why not knock over a gas station?

72
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:45,735
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, Johnny.

73
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,935
Hi, Mom.
You always were a sucker for a left.

74
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,535
- Come on, take a break.
- I can't.

75
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:56,235
I'm a year behind
on Mr. Stevenson's shirts.

76
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,335
There's a new law.
No wash on your birthday.

77
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:02,635
Gosh, Johnny, I really
don't think that's a law.

78
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,535
Well, you won't find it in your law books
because I just made it up.

79
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,735
He colored Oliver Wendell Holmes purple.

80
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:15,535
Isn't that something?
And him only 6 years old.

81
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:20,435
- Your father would have been proud.
- He always wanted you to be a lawyer.

82
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,835
He sure could have used one.
- You'll make something of yourself.

83
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:28,435
- I'll see that you do.
- No mother was ever blessed...

84
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,535
...with two finer sons
than Johnny and Tommy Kelly.

85
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:37,335
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Bless the saints, it's an ashtray.

86
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:40,535
I've been thinking of taking up smoking.
This clinches it.

87
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:46,535
- How does it feel to be 29?
- I only hope I reach 30.

88
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:50,235
- Are you all right, Mom?
- I'll be fine.

89
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:55,635
Johnny, you go back to work.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.

90
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:05,535
- She needs an operation immediately.
- it'd break my mother's heart.

91
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:09,335
- $49.95.
- How'd you like to make a 50?

92
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,935
- I just hope I reach 30.
- I’ll be at the Club 25.

93
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:18,035
Sorry, Mom.
It's the only way I know how.

94
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,435
No more nodding!

95
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:19,035
Dundee's gang is here.

96
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:23,235
What's that bastidge want?

97
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:32,535
- How's tricks, Moronie?
- What are you doing here, icehole?

98
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:36,035
Can't a fellow enjoy
a night gambling with his pals?

99
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:40,035
Don't bullshty me.
Search the sum in a batch.

100
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:44,135
We're clean, Moronie.
You see, I don't bear no grudges...

101
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:47,835
...even though your boys have been
muscling in on my territory.

102
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,535
Why do you do that, Moronie?

103
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,635
- It's a free country, icehole.
- They're clean, boss.

104
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:57,735
Okay, you and the rest
of your bastidges can gamble.

105
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:04,235
But don't try no fargin trick,
or you'll end up with your bells in a sling.

106
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:11,235
What a mouth on that guy.

107
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,835
Hey, kid.

108
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:30,035
Paper, mister?

109
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,335
Here you go.

110
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,135
- Here you are, sir.
- Thanks, kid.

111
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:47,935
Nobody move and nobody will get hurt.

112
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:52,335
All we want is Moronie's money.
Go ahead, kid.

113
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:56,135
You fargin, sneaky bastidge.

114
00:12:56,435 --> 00:13:01,735
I'm gonna take your dwork.
I'm gonna nail it to the wall!

115
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,835
I'm gonna crush your boils
in a meat grinder!

116
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:10,535
I'm gonna cut off your arms
and shove them up your icehole!

117
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:15,235
Dirty sum in a batch!
My own club.

118
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:16,635
Mr. Dundee, watch out!

119
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:24,535
Stupid, lock the fargin door!
We got Dundee!

120
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,835
Get that lousy kid!
Get that sum in a batch.

121
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:43,235
Get him! It's only a fargin kid,
you fargin styheads!

122
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,735
Get him!

123
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:49,335
Give me a gun.
Give me a gun!

124
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:55,135
- Next shooter.
Kid's like a monkey.

125
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,635
Get him! It's only a fargin kid.
Kill him!

126
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,835
Hell of an anniversary, Lou.

127
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:12,035
I don't believe you guys!
Get him, or you're all fired!

128
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:20,435
No, no, no. Permesso.
Say your prayers, icehole.

129
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,535
Hold it.

130
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:35,135
Why you miserable corksucker.
I'm gonna get you for this.

131
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:41,735
Roman Moronie never forgets
a fargin face, kid. I'll get you.

132
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,335
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, thanks to this kid...

133
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,535
...and this.
Thanks a lot, kid.

134
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,935
- From now on, you're my boy.
Yeah, you really live dangerously.

135
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:08,735
- By the way, what's your name?
- Johnny. Johnny...

136
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,335
Johnny Dangerously.

137
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:15,835
I should've never picked that name.
A name like that, you gotta live up to.

138
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:20,835
Act tough. Put up a front.
I got into a lot of fights.

139
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,735
- What's your last name?
- Binderhoff.

140
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:27,835
Great. Don't change that name
and you'll stay out of trouble.

141
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,435
Anyway, Mom's pancreas got better.
Things generally improved.

142
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,435
And I didn't have to work
for the Dundee gang.

143
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,835
I was your average,
poverty-stricken teenager...

144
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:42,835
...thinking about girls, my hair, girls.

145
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:05,035
Gee, Johnny, I’ve never seen
anyone dance like that!

146
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:09,735
- Dr. Magnus, how's my mother?
- It's her thyroid, Johnny.

147
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:10,935
What's wrong with it?

148
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,535
We can't find it.
Gonna have to do a thyroid search.

149
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:19,435
- How much is that gonna cost?
- You're in luck. This week it's just $999.

150
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,635
$999?

151
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:27,335
Talk about bad luck.
There was only one place for me to go.

152
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:31,135
I joined the Jocko Dundee mob full time.

153
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:35,235
Jocko was still at war
with his old enemy, Roman Moronie.

154
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,235
The years didn't soften Moronie.

155
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,835
He continued to murder
the English language...

156
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,235
...and anyone who got in his way.

157
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:49,035
Moronie had a lot of rules for his gang.
Number one: Never park in his space.

158
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:52,335
The Dundee gang was a lot more fun.

159
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:56,135
Sure we did illegal things, but we
never bothered the general public.

160
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:01,035
And every Christmas, Jocko returned
a little cash back to the community.

161
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:04,735
Every chance I got,
I returned to the old neighborhood.

162
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,735
They looked up to me
like I was a folk hero.

163
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,335
"I love Johnny" T-shirts.
I love Johnny.

164
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:15,135
Johnny, can I follow in your footsteps?

165
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,635
Sure, kid.
Here, it was burning a hole in my pocket.

166
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:23,435
Look, Rosie, it's Johnny Dangerously.

167
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:28,635
Mrs. Zimmer.
Everybody, over here.

168
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,735
Now what did I tell all you people?

169
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:39,035
Around here you're Johnny Kelly,
a law-abiding night club owner...

170
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,735
...not the notorious gangster
Johnny Dangerously.

171
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:46,435
Sure, and I’m the pope.

172
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:51,335
- Hey, pope. How'd you know?
- Johnny, everybody knows...

173
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:57,735
...except your mother and your brother.
And nobody here is gonna say nothing.

174
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:03,835
Thanks, Your Holiness. Tell you what,
build yourself a new gym at the Vatican.

175
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:13,035
Bless you, Johnny.

176
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,535
Johnny!

177
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,335
Hi, Ma.

178
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:29,135
How's my best girl?

179
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,235
You gotta watch that left, Ma.

180
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:36,535
I love him, but some day
I’m gonna knock him on his ass.

181
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:42,835
- What are you cooking, Ma?
- Beer.

182
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:47,635
With noodles? What a great idea.

183
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:53,535
- What's new?
- Me arthritis, that's new.

184
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,835
One of the muscles in me calf
is shriveling up.

185
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:03,035
Also, I’m losing sensation in me face.
I think it's a neurological disorder.

186
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:09,335
- But the rest of me is in the pink.
- You gotta take better care of yourself.

187
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:13,835
I don't want you living like this
and doing other people's laundry.

188
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:17,835
What are you saying,
give up me career?

189
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:22,035
Maybe you ought to retire.
Enjoy the golden years, Ma...

190
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:24,935
...not do this.

191
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:31,235
Son, I couldn't consider retiring.

192
00:19:31,535 --> 00:19:36,635
Not so long as I can still
give good laundry.

193
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:41,535
- Where's Tommy?
- Don't be talking to me about Tommy.

194
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:47,235
- Why not?
- Because I’m leaving law school.

195
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:52,835
- If this is a joke, I ain't laughing.
- I'm dropping out and marrying Sally.

196
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,635
- You can't change my mind.
- Is this what you want, Sally?

197
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:02,635
I want whatever Tommy wants.
I'm his girl, and he makes the decisions.

198
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,735
Sally's place is in the home,
and I intend to support her.

199
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,335
I'll shine boots, drive a hack,
blow glass, anything.

200
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:15,935
- Johnny, please, talk sense to him.
- You're breaking your mother's heart.

201
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:21,435
- Why, Tommy? Why?
- I can't say it in front of Mom.

202
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:25,935
Okay. I've got a little business
to take care of.

203
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:30,435
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 10:00?

204
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:35,435
All right, you little muskrat.

205
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,835
- I'll see you, Sally.
Bye.

206
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:41,935
Ma, don't worry about a thing.
I'll straighten everything out.

207
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:48,035
Hey, Ma, what's this in your ear? $100?

208
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:55,335
- What can't you say in front of Mom?
- Nothing, Mom.

209
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:58,335
I know what you can't say.
You wanna get laid.

210
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:00,935
- Mom!
- You wanna hump your brains out.

211
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:03,735
Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

212
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:10,235
Hi, Pat.
- Top of the morning. How's your mother?

213
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:13,535
Much better, Pat. Thanks for asking.

214
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:17,835
- Such a wonderful woman.
- Yes, she is. A sweet little lady.

215
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:22,635
She's got the smile of an angel.

216
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,335
Johnny is here!
Johnny!

217
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:52,235
Johnny!
Johnny!

218
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,235
You wanna be my first?
No, it's my turn.

219
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:58,335
- I'm not wearing a bra.
- That makes two of us.

220
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:01,635
- I'm a real blond, Johnny.
- Check it out Thursday?

221
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,935
- You're on.
- How do you do it, Johnny?

222
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:07,735
Mutual respect.

223
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:13,635
- Hey, who's the nightingale?
- She just flew in from Pittsburgh.

224
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:17,835
Say, kid? What do they call you?

225
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:21,535
- Impressive.
- Her name is Lil Sheridan.

226
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:23,635
Thanks.

227
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:27,535
Lil Sheridan, huh?

228
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,135
My name's Dangerously...
Johnny Dangerously.

229
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:33,235
Did you know
your last name's an adverb?

230
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:36,935
Hey. I like that.

231
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:42,435
You got spirit,
spunk, fire, verve.

232
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:49,035
- You got those. I like those on a woman.
- Gee, my heart's all a flutter.

233
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,735
I'll tell you what,
why don't you take my card.

234
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:57,335
- Enjoying yourself?
- You call me tomorrow.

235
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:02,535
Yeah? Don't be upset when you don't
hear the phone ringing.

236
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:08,035
- Suit yourself.
- I hope this is helping your morale.

237
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:11,535
That's the first time I had
to take that card back.

238
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,335
I kind of like it.

239
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,235
I'll be seeing you.

240
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:36,035
Does the word "smitten"
mean anything to anybody?

241
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:39,335
Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Vito.

242
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:41,935
Vito, better cut down on the pasta.

243
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:44,835
- I'm starting a diet on Monday.
- Attaboy.

244
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:48,835
- What are you so happy about?
- Well, Vito, I just met an angel...

245
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:52,935
...an absolute angel.
- You met Lil, huh?

246
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:57,935
I sure did, Mr. Dundee.
You see this card? This card...

247
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:01,835
...has been to paradise.
Johnny's in love.

248
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:05,835
You remind me of me
and the wife 20 years ago.

249
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:08,835
Of course, Mae never looked like Lil.

250
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:13,035
And now she looks like him.

251
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:18,335
- But what am I, a beauty?
- Dames are put on Earth to weaken us...

252
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:22,435
...drain our energy,
laugh at us when they see us naked.

253
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:28,635
Meet two new members of the gang:
Danny Vermin and his sidekick, Dutch.

254
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,435
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, Danny.

255
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,335
Danny and I used to fight in
the old neighborhood.

256
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:36,035
I wondered what happened to you.

257
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:41,535
Well, I fulfilled a lot of people's
predictions. I've become a real scumbag.

258
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:43,435
Good for you.

259
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:47,035
A lot of people go their whole lives
without realizing what they wanna be.

260
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:58,535
Delivery for Jocko Dundee.

261
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:04,735
There's some postage due,
but I’ll take care of it. No problem.

262
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:07,335
What's this?

263
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,935
He sent us a robot.

264
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:24,735
"Dear Bastidges,
I hope I got a few of you.

265
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:31,435
If not, I’ll get you when I take over
the Club 25. Love and kisses, Moronie. "

266
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:36,335
- We gotta stop him.
- I got something to stop him.

267
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:41,135
They made it for him special.
It's an. 88 magnum.

268
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:43,735
It shoots through schools.

269
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:48,835
Vermin, maybe you got
too much sugar in your diet.

270
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:51,935
We do things differently around here.
Put the gun away.

271
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,235
Maybe I will and maybe I won't.

272
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:59,035
- Stash the rod, Danny.
- You shouldn't grab me, Johnny.

273
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:02,135
My mother grabbed me once.

274
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,835
Once.

275
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:07,935
- What are you gonna do, Johnny?
- I'll think of something...

276
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:12,635
...something clever,
something unexpected...

277
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,135
...something subtle.

278
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:25,835
- You know, this club is too fargin small.
- Yeah.

279
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:30,235
- How big was the crowd last night?
- Packed. We had to turn them away.

280
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:34,635
That's what I mean.
We've got to expand this fargin place.

281
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:39,535
Knock down that wall.
Knock down that wall.

282
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,835
And knock down that fargin wall.

283
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:49,235
Now I’m really angry.
This is fargin war.

284
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:05,635
You must be Tommy.
Come in.

285
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:09,035
Johnny's expecting you.

286
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,835
Follow me.

287
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:17,635
Hello, Tommy.

288
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:25,635
Tommy, have a seat
you little muskrat.

289
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:32,335
What's this bull fertilizer
about you quitting school?

290
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:37,535
I'm sorry, Johnny. I just haven't got
the tits for it. I mean, heart.

291
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:41,735
Tommy, I want you to pay attention.

292
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:46,435
I don't understand. You're tops
in your class. You made the law review.

293
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:52,235
- Why do you have to get married now?
- Because if I don't get laid, I’ll die.

294
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:56,135
Laid! Is that what
this is about, getting laid?

295
00:27:56,435 --> 00:28:00,035
- I thought it was something serious.
It is serious.

296
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:05,735
I've tried going to bad girls, but for a
clean-cut kid like me, it's just no dice.

297
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:10,035
Oh, God! How do you get laid in 1930?

298
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:13,535
You think this is fun, Tom?

299
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:16,235
You think this is a picnic, Tommy?

300
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:19,835
You got a lot to learn, kid.
It's a bad habit.

301
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:24,535
It's like drinking coffee.
Believe me, if I could quit, I would.

302
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:29,235
Come on in here, Tom.
I wanna talk to you about something.

303
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:38,235
I think this is the most important
reason you should wait. Have a seat.

304
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:45,035
I wanna show you something, Tom,
something I think might open your eyes.

305
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:58,235
Your testicles and you.

306
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:02,435
Take a good look.
These are the unlucky ones.

307
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:07,835
These unfortunate souls
are suffering from ESS...

308
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,935
...Enlarged Scrotum Syndrome.

309
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:16,535
For these poor devils, it's too late.
But there is hope.

310
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,935
Here, at the Atlanta Genital institute...

311
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:26,035
...teams of doctors are at work around
the clock to cure this dreaded affliction.

312
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:32,735
Hi, I’m Dr. Zillman, and I’d like
to talk to you about your testes.

313
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:38,535
The human testicle is like a balloon.
Sometimes, it is empty.

314
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:43,635
And sometimes... it is full.

315
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:47,635
And sometimes... it can explode.

316
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:50,735
Maybe this will help you understand.

317
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:55,835
Just remember that your testicles,
when treated with love and care...

318
00:29:56,235 --> 00:30:00,835
...will give you years
of maintenance-free service.

319
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:08,135
But if abused...

320
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:10,035
...well, the inevitable conclusion:

321
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:17,635
So next time, do the smart thing.
Don't let anything come between...

322
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:22,535
...your testicles and you. Thank you.

323
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:32,335
- Where are you going?
- Back to law school.

324
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:45,835
Let's hear it for the band.

325
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:50,635
Johnny, great to see you.
I've got an announcement to make.

326
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:54,435
When I die,
hopefully in my bed...

327
00:30:57,735 --> 00:31:03,735
...I wanna know that the Dundee mob
will continue with the same traditions...

328
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:10,535
...with the same high standards that have
made us the New York Yankees of crime.

329
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:18,235
And for that reason,
I’m naming as my successor...

330
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:21,935
...Johnny Dangerously.

331
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:31,035
Now I want you to give a warm welcome
to a very shy, retiring, little lady...

332
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:34,635
...who's come to us from a
convent school in Pittsburgh:

333
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,535
Lil Sheridan.

334
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:05,735
Yeah!

335
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:05,035
There's Johnny.

336
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:08,335
He's so cute.

337
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,235
You're holding up traffic.

338
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:23,435
That song you just sang,
I figured that gave me the green light.

339
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:28,935
Let's just say you're off red,
but you're still on amber.

340
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,835
I hope that light changes soon
because my motor's running.

341
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:36,735
You better be careful,
you don't wanna overheat.

342
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:39,535
- I'll tell you one thing...
- What's that?

343
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,335
...you sure can banter.

344
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:46,935
So then I decided to leave Pittsburgh
and come here to Chicago.

345
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,035
- Lil?
- Yeah?

346
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:54,635
This ain't Chicago.
We're in New York.

347
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:57,435
You're kidding.

348
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:04,535
New York, Chicago.
To a girl on her own, it's all the same.

349
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:12,935
I figured Mom and Dad didn't need
me around, not with 14 mouths to feed.

350
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:17,935
- Your folks had 14 kids?
- No, they ran a kennel.

351
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:23,035
- What about your folks?
- My mom practically raised us by herself.

352
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:29,435
I never knew my father or my uncle.
I kind of knew my grandmother.

353
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:34,335
Didn't know my grandfather.
Never knew any of my cousins.

354
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:38,035
- Any pets?
- Yeah, we had a dog.

355
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:42,935
He ran away when I was a kid.
I never knew him.

356
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:52,335
Where the hell are we?

357
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:01,835
- Johnny, I’m falling in a big way.
- You got company, kid.

358
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:06,635
Where we gonna land?
And when we do, will our hearts break?

359
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:12,235
I'm sure there are answers
to all these questions, but first...

360
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:27,735
Sounds like Johnny's getting laid.

361
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:34,435
Moronie was still on the warpath.

362
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:37,135
Even getting to work was an adventure.

363
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:40,335
- Johnny, be careful.
- Don't worry, doll.

364
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:44,035
There's not a bullet out there
with my name on it.

365
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:49,435
I couldn't stand it if something
happened to you.

366
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:52,135
Neither could I.

367
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:14,535
One hippopotamus,
two hippopotamus...

368
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:18,035
...three hippopotamus.
Go!

369
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:41,735
- Whoa. Wait!
- Get him!

370
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,235
Morning, Johnny.
- Hiya, Pat.

371
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,835
How's that precious mother of yours?

372
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:07,235
- You been out there today?
- Pretty rough, huh?

373
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,635
Not as bad as yesterday.

374
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:14,035
- You'll feel better if you have a cookie.
- Thanks.

375
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:18,235
- All fixed, Mr. Dundee.
- Thanks, pal.

376
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:23,235
- Who's that guy?
- The plumber. My drain was stuck.

377
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:28,235
Where is all this gangland warfare
getting us anyway?

378
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:30,835
I want Moronie.

379
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:35,835
And I’m not gonna rest
until I get him.

380
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,935
Or until he gets you.

381
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:42,535
Hey! Hey!

382
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:48,035
Oh! Relax, Johnny. Relax.
Come on.

383
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:54,635
A year from now, we're gonna look back
on all this and have one big laugh.

384
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,435
Oh, boy.

385
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,835
I really had to wee wee.

386
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:08,235
That's funny. This bathroom drain
was never stuck before.

387
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:13,435
Mr. Dundee, wait!

388
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:23,535
- Got the number of that other plumber?
Mr. Dundee...

389
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:29,535
Oh, my God! Moronie, you son
of a bitch! What have you done to me?

390
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,735
- Calm down.
- Why go on living?

391
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,235
Look, don't panic.

392
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:39,935
Calm down? I'm standing here
with my dork in my hand.

393
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,335
It's not your dork. Look.

394
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:47,335
- Ah. Thank God. It's just the chain handle.
- Sure.

395
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:52,035
Freddie, you're still here,
you little bald-headed beauty.

396
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:56,635
I thought I lost you.
Johnny...

397
00:39:57,035 --> 00:40:00,335
...this is a sign from above.
You okay, boss?

398
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:04,735
Johnny, I’m retiring before it's too late.

399
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:09,335
You remember this? Take it.
You're the boss now.

400
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:14,435
I don't know. It's a lot of responsibility.
I don't know if I’m ready.

401
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:19,235
- I'm ready for it.
- Forget it, Vermin.

402
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:34,635
I was on top, kid.
Moronie and I worked out a truce.

403
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:38,835
Lil and I were going strong.
And as for Ma...

404
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:44,135
...between the occasional transplant
and bypass, her health was improving.

405
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:49,535
- Yeah, I was on top of the world.
- Well, that was a great story, pops.

406
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:54,235
- So long.
- Wait, I’m just getting to the sad part.

407
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:58,735
See, now that everything else
in my life was going well...

408
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:02,535
...I was about to face
the greatest challenge of my life.

409
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,835
- Oh, Tommy. We're so proud of him.
- We sure are, kid.

410
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:17,735
- I owe it all to you, Johnny.
- Oh, go on.

411
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:23,535
This calls for a picture. The two
Kelly boys. Wait till I get me camera.

412
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:29,435
Hold this.
Where the hell is that camera?

413
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:38,635
Tommy, I want you to have
a little something.

414
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:43,535
- Kimball, Pritchard & Williston?
- Biggest law firm in the city.

415
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:46,735
I think you'll find them receptive.

416
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:50,235
Gee, thanks, Johnny,
but I’ve already made up my mind.

417
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:55,935
I know you're gonna be proud of me.
I'm joining the district attorney's office.

418
00:41:56,435 --> 00:42:02,335
I'm gonna dedicate my life
to fighting crime. Isn't that great?

419
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:08,135
Right. My little brother,
who I put through law school...

420
00:42:08,535 --> 00:42:12,335
...is gonna be fighting crime.
Crime.

421
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,535
Mom, it's prohibition.

422
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,935
Oh, shut up.
Stop acting like a fag choir boy.

423
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:22,235
Here, another one.

424
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:26,935
To me two darling sons,
one a famous night club owner...

425
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,635
...the other a crime fighter.

426
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,535
With a father like Killer Kelly...

427
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:37,235
...it's a miracle neither of you turned
out to be a piece-of-shit criminal.

428
00:42:38,235 --> 00:42:41,035
Maybe she was right.
I decided to go legit...

429
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:43,435
...but then I got hit with more
bad news about Mom.

430
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:46,135
- About your mom, John...
- What is it? How much?

431
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:50,335
- The blocked salivary gland. $7500.
- Really?

432
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,735
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
It'll be good to see her spit again.

433
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:58,835
I went back to crime,
and Tommy went to work for the DA.

434
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:02,635
Fortunately, I had the DA
on our payroll. So I wasn't too worried.

435
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:10,435
Hi. I'm the new assistant DA
I'm joining you in the war against crime.

436
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:14,435
- The boss in?
- In there.

437
00:43:17,435 --> 00:43:22,435
Tommy Kelly reporting for work.
- Kelly, welcome to the team.

438
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:26,335
I'm proud to be part of any team
whose adversary is crime.

439
00:43:26,735 --> 00:43:29,335
Well said. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

440
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:33,735
That's why we scout the law schools
for young idealists like yourself.

441
00:43:34,135 --> 00:43:38,235
But before you begin,
why not ease into the job?

442
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:42,135
- Take a little vacation.
- A vacation?

443
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:45,035
But what about crime?

444
00:43:45,635 --> 00:43:48,735
Don't worry. It'll still be here
when you get back.

445
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:51,235
But don't you see? That's the trouble.

446
00:43:51,535 --> 00:43:54,835
Crime will always be here
unless something is done about it.

447
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,235
Tommy didn't go on vacation.

448
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,235
He became the city's
most tireless crime fighter.

449
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:06,635
He fought crime in the newspapers.
He attacked it on the radio.

450
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:09,335
He arrested every criminal in town.

451
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:13,335
And then, he turned his sights
on my old enemy, Moronie.

452
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,735
Roman Troy Moronie
is the man responsible for...

453
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:21,835
...the Mother's Day Massacre,
the Christmas Day Slaughter...

454
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:27,035
...the Lincoln's Birthday Mutilation,
and the Groundhog's Day Beheadings.

455
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:31,335
Before we begin the questions,
my client would like to read a statement.

456
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,735
Go ahead.

457
00:44:34,035 --> 00:44:39,935
I would like to direct this to
the distinguished members of the panel.

458
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:45,435
"You lousy corksuckers,
you have violated my fargin rights.

459
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:49,935
This sum in a batching country
was founded...

460
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:55,635
...so that the liberties of common
patriotic citizens like me...

461
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:01,135
...could not be taken away
by a bunch of fargin iceholes...

462
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:04,435
...like yourselves. "
Thank you very much.

463
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:05,635
[MUMBLING}

464
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:10,135
What do the names
Benny the Hump, Roland Carpidi...

465
00:45:10,435 --> 00:45:12,435
...and Izzy the Nose mean to you?

466
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:15,335
They don't mean a thing.

467
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:17,935
- Recognize this?
- No.

468
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:22,235
Can you explain how your fingerprints
got on this gun...

469
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:27,335
...which was used to kill everyone
in the building at 110 East 40th Street?

470
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:28,835
Where'd you get that?

471
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:32,135
If a train left New York
at 300 miles per hour...

472
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:35,135
...and accelerated speed
15 miles per hour...

473
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:38,235
...and traveled a distance
of 683 miles...

474
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:42,635
...tell me, sir, what time
would that train reach Chicago?

475
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:46,535
- That's a fargin trick question!
- What time?

476
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:56,535
This weed of crime
that threatens to grow unchecked...

477
00:45:56,935 --> 00:46:03,135
...and choke off this beautiful flower,
which is our free democratic society.

478
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,635
I never thought this radio stunt
would catch on.

479
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:11,835
He's impossible to control. The public
sees him as a knight in shining armor.

480
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:15,735
This goes through armor.
Then it goes through the victim...

481
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:19,935
...through the wall, through a tree...
- Relax.

482
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:24,835
- Kelly's got nothing on us.
- Maybe we should wait until he does.

483
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:26,135
Pipe down, Vermin.

484
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:29,335
We knock off Kelly, and the whole city
would be breathing down our necks.

485
00:46:29,735 --> 00:46:33,235
If Jocko was in charge,
we'd be making cement loafers for him.

486
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:37,635
Jocko's not in charge, I am.
Got it?

487
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:42,235
Burr, talk some sense to the kid.
Get him to play ball.

488
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:46,735
Fabulous idea, Johnny. We'll appeal
to the more practical side of the man.

489
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:51,435
There you go. While you're at it,
buy yourself a second home.

490
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:55,535
- Thanks, Johnny.
- Sure.

491
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,235
This gang's getting soft.

492
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:02,735
By letting Kelly take us apart, we'd be
the laughingstock of the underworld.

493
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:04,035
Yeah.

494
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:07,535
At parties, people ask what I do.
I'm embarrassed. I say I’m a barber.

495
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:12,535
I told somebody I was a male nurse.
I'm ashamed to admit I’m a criminal.

496
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:16,635
- Me too.
- We gotta do something about this.

497
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:20,135
Boy, you fellas really disappoint me.

498
00:47:20,435 --> 00:47:23,435
Take a look around you.
What do you see?

499
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:28,535
I'll tell you what I see.
I see some guys doing pretty damn good.

500
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:33,335
- Manny, you got a sauna?
- Yeah, I got a sauna.

501
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:34,935
All right.

502
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:38,835
Ollie, you send your mother
to Norway every summer, don't you?

503
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:40,635
Yeah, Johnny.

504
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:44,735
Vito, how many hats do you own?

505
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:48,435
Upwards of around 180.

506
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:51,935
180 hats. That's a lot of hats.

507
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:56,235
You never told me that.
- Tell me another gang in New York...

508
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:58,535
...that's got a dental plan.

509
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:03,635
- Do you know why we're so successful?
- Why, Johnny? Tell us.

510
00:48:03,835 --> 00:48:07,735
Because we're diversified.
Diversification.

511
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,435
We're exploring new
and exciting areas of crime.

512
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:17,635
We better, because there are Japanese
gangs who'll do it faster and cheaper.

513
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:21,935
Believe me, fellas. Believe me.
There's so much out there...

514
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:26,135
...you could find something you like.
- I like what I’m doing right now.

515
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:30,235
I enjoy collecting protection money,
putting whores to work, loan sharking.

516
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:35,235
I enjoy planting bombs in people's cars.
These are a few of my favorite things.

517
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:37,035
Sick? Don't ask.

518
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:41,635
You missed, fuckface.

519
00:48:43,535 --> 00:48:45,035
All right, Vermin.

520
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:49,735
You're not getting that back
until you've matured.

521
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:51,635
Aren't we touchy today, Johnny?

522
00:48:51,935 --> 00:48:55,735
What's the matter? Something going on
between you and Kelly?

523
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:04,535
You shouldn't hang me on a hook.
My father hung me on a hook once.

524
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:07,335
Once.

525
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:13,235
- Come on, boys. I'm buying.
- Now you're talking.

526
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:17,935
Bye, Danny.
Hang in there, Vermin.

527
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,835
There's something fishy with
Johnny and that DA.

528
00:49:21,135 --> 00:49:24,435
And I’m gonna find out what it is.

529
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:45,935
Good news, sir.

530
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:48,335
I got enough to put Dangerously
where he belongs.

531
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:51,835
Hold it. We don't even know
such a man exists.

532
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:56,135
Until now.
Sir, I have got conclusive evidence:

533
00:49:56,435 --> 00:50:01,035
Notarized depositions,
tire prints, blood samples.

534
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:05,035
I've got eyewitness accounts,
murder weapons, fingerprints...

535
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,335
Hold it. Hold it, kid.

536
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:11,635
It's flimsy. It's not enough.

537
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:16,435
It'll never hold up in a court of law.
Let's put this aside.

538
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:21,635
We're here to socialize, not talk shop.

539
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:29,935
- Had enough milk-fed veal, Tommy?
- Yes, sir. Delicious.

540
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:34,235
Now, can we get back
to this damaging evidence...

541
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:38,835
...on Johnny Dangerously?
- No. Tonight, I wanna talk about...

542
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:44,735
...Tommy Kelly and his future.
You're engaged, aren't you?

543
00:50:45,135 --> 00:50:50,335
Yes, sir, I am. To a fine and decent girl.
We plan to be married soon.

544
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:55,335
- As soon as you can afford it, eh?
- We'll manage.

545
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:58,935
Oh, I’m sure you will.

546
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:02,935
But a little help can't hurt.

547
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:06,635
Come here, Tom.
Let me show you something.

548
00:51:14,735 --> 00:51:16,135
It's time to play ball!

549
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:20,935
Let's see what's in store
for Tommy Kelly if he plays ball!

550
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:25,935
In a hurry, Sally? Pop it into
this time-saving microflame oven.

551
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,235
Cook a whole turkey in just under a day!

552
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:34,735
In a rut, Tom? Get away from it all.
Take a trip around the world...

553
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:40,535
...on us! Twice!
Aboard the S.S. Kelly.

554
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:46,235
And when you return,
move into your own cozy, little love nest.

555
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:51,735
Plenty of extra closet space.
Perfect for entertaining.

556
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:55,735
And on those chilly winter nights...

557
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,235
...Sally can wrap herself up
in this number.

558
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:05,335
And on those hot summer nights,
she can wrap herself up in ice!

559
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:10,235
It's all yours, Tommy,
if you play ball!

560
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:14,335
What do you say?

561
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:19,035
I say I’ll see you behind bars.

562
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:35,635
- Yeah, what's up?
Didn't go for it. What should I do?

563
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:39,935
Hold on, I’ll ask Johnny.
What do you wanna do about Kelly?

564
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:42,635
Kill him.
He wants you to kill him.

565
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:47,135
I thought he'd feel that way.
So I’ve taken care of it.

566
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:17,135
Oh, my God!

567
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:25,035
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

568
00:53:30,535 --> 00:53:34,435
- Which one's Tommy?
- You got me.

569
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:40,535
This is him. He's got his father's eyes.
Give me a pen.

570
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:46,635
In case they move him.

571
00:53:48,735 --> 00:53:52,835
Hey, Ma? Is he gonna...?
Are they...?

572
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:57,035
- Will he...?
- Croak? No, don't you worry.

573
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:01,935
Dr. Kaplan says he's going to be fine.
We Kellys are tough.

574
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:05,635
- What happened?
- He was coming from the DA's house...

575
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:09,835
...and his brakes failed.
- His brakes?

576
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:13,435
I smell a rat.

577
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:17,435
Get yourself a cab.

578
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:20,935
I got a little business to attend to.

579
00:54:26,335 --> 00:54:30,035
This is very nice, although unexpected.

580
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:34,635
Well, I figure you've been on the take
from us for all these years.

581
00:54:35,035 --> 00:54:41,335
- It's just my way of saying thanks.
- That's generous of you. You know...

582
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:47,335
...you've always seemed to me
to be more sensitive than the rest.

583
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:50,835
We should spend some time together.

584
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,735
Say, two weeks in Puerto Rico?

585
00:54:56,535 --> 00:55:02,835
It's a thought. By the way,
I picked a little something up for you.

586
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,735
Ah, John.

587
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:13,635
A smoking jacket.

588
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,935
Red, my favorite color.

589
00:55:26,035 --> 00:55:28,835
Tasty. What is this we're drinking?

590
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:34,035
Read the label. Excuse me for a minute,
I've gotta make a call.

591
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:38,335
"Malt liquor. "

592
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:58,035
Yo!

593
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:14,535
My God. My God, I can see.
I can see.

594
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:43,135
- Hi, honey. I'm home.
Johnny, you're early.

595
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:46,135
That's all right, isn't it?

596
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:51,335
Johnny, you never missed before.
Is something wrong?

597
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:57,535
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Mrs. Capone.

598
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,635
Could I borrow a cup of bullets.
We're a little short.

599
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:02,735
We're a little low here too,
Mrs. Capone.

600
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,935
Oh, boy. Al's gonna be pissed.

601
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:08,235
Hey, well, maybe Al's gonna have
to stay home tonight.

602
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,635
Gee.

603
00:57:10,835 --> 00:57:14,135
- Johnny, you weren't very nice to her.
- Oh, no?

604
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:18,335
When's somebody gonna be nice
to Johnny Dangerously?

605
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:22,635
Look at this.
My own brother is out to get me...

606
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:26,235
...that psycho Vermin's out to get him,
the gang's getting antsy...

607
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:29,235
...and the Crime Commission's
breathing down my neck.

608
00:57:30,235 --> 00:57:35,835
- I hope that's for a small grownup.
- Just wishful thinking.

609
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:41,235
- Maybe someday, kid.
- When, Johnny?

610
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:44,535
When are we gonna stop running
and start living?

611
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:46,635
I don't mean to complain...

612
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:51,535
...but with Sally and Tommy getting
hitched tomorrow, it got me thinking.

613
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:57,035
I got a real, old-fashioned streak in me.
I wanna live a normal life.

614
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:01,935
Johnny Dangerously can't live
a normal life. It ain't in the cards.

615
00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:06,835
People like me,
we're like shooting stars.

616
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:12,135
We cross the sky, burning hot
for one moment in time, and then we...

617
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:17,535
...plunge to earth, disappear. Jesus
Christ, I’m starting to upset myself.

618
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:21,335
Oh, but, Johnny,
it doesn't have to be that way.

619
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:28,035
- We can change.
- I don't know, Lil. Dare we dream?

620
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:33,735
Hanging curtains, ironing shirts.

621
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:37,935
- Car pools, PTA.
- Sharing a casserole recipe.

622
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:42,135
Putting up shelf paper.
Oh, Johnny, I love shelf paper.

623
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:47,335
- A little house, white picket fence.
- Kids and dogs playing in the yard.

624
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:51,935
Saying hi to a neighbor named Fred.

625
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:56,135
Maybe there is a rainbow
for us out there.

626
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:59,135
Sure, we had dreams.

627
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,535
But when you're in crime,
dreams don't always come true.

628
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,535
Follow them.

629
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:22,635
Park in this spot here.
- It's for the handicapped.

630
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:27,335
I am handicapped. I'm psychotic.

631
00:59:30,535 --> 00:59:36,535
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

632
00:59:43,435 --> 00:59:47,035
You're like a daughter to me,
and I wanna share something with you.

633
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:51,235
- What's that, Mom Kelly?
- I go both ways.

634
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,735
I'm glad we waited,
but I can't wait anymore.

635
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:10,835
- Okay, where?
- Some place real close.

636
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:35,035
I know Tommy's excited,
but I wonder if he knows about foreplay.

637
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:37,735
- He'll figure it out.
- And when will you follow...

638
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:43,435
...your brother's example, Johnny Kelly?
- Brothers.

639
01:00:44,435 --> 01:00:47,735
I knew there was something.

640
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:52,235
Leave your face right there.

641
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:56,635
How do you like that? Johnny
Dangerously is Tommy Kelly's brother.

642
01:00:57,535 --> 01:01:03,135
- What?
- Dangerously is the DA's brother.

643
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:13,035
That's it? You little shit!

644
01:01:20,335 --> 01:01:21,935
Hallelujah!

645
01:01:26,835 --> 01:01:31,035
There you are. I was wondering
what happened to my kid brother.

646
01:01:31,435 --> 01:01:36,135
I'm Johnny Kelly's kid brother,
not Johnny Dangerously's.

647
01:01:36,535 --> 01:01:41,535
It was just a matter of time, wasn't it?
All I ask is that you don't tell Ma.

648
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:46,035
She's gonna find out,
because when I put you behind bars...

649
01:01:46,435 --> 01:01:49,235
...your picture's gonna be
on the front page everywhere.

650
01:01:49,635 --> 01:01:54,035
- Why, Johnny? Why?
- I don't know, kid.

651
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:57,635
Maybe it's because that big dealer up in
the sky shuffles the cards...

652
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:00,035
...and we just play what we're dealt.

653
01:02:00,335 --> 01:02:04,435
- It's against the law to gamble!
- Jesus Christ.

654
01:02:04,935 --> 01:02:08,935
I took an oath to fight crime,
but I can't go against my own brother.

655
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:13,535
- We have to settle this with our fists.
- Wait a minute, kid.

656
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:18,335
- You can't fight me. I'm too good.
- I'll take my chances.

657
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,635
Okay. I win, you quit.

658
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:28,435
- You win, I quit.
- All right.

659
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:37,435
Johnny, take a dive.

660
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:49,135
I didn't know you packed such a wallop.

661
01:02:49,535 --> 01:02:52,235
All right, Tom, you win.

662
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:57,335
- I'm going legit.
- Gee, thanks, Johnny!

663
01:02:57,835 --> 01:02:58,935
Hey.

664
01:03:07,635 --> 01:03:09,735
This time, I really was going legit.

665
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:14,235
Now all I had to do
was make the gang understand.

666
01:03:18,935 --> 01:03:23,035
- Who did that?
- Sorry. Did I get you?

667
01:03:23,735 --> 01:03:27,235
You ruined the jacket. See?

668
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:31,435
- When do we tell the boys about Johnny?
- As soon as he gets here.

669
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:35,535
I wanna see the look on his face.

670
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:44,435
You know, you're not doing
yourself any good.

671
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:50,035
And for you kids out there who are
thinking about smoking, don't start.

672
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,035
And if you've started, stop.

673
01:03:52,335 --> 01:03:55,935
Smoking don't make you look tough,
it makes you look stupid.

674
01:03:56,235 --> 01:03:59,135
If you've gotta put something
in your mouth...

675
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:04,535
...make it a stick of chewing gum.
Sure. That's what Johnny does.

676
01:04:04,835 --> 01:04:08,635
Smoking is the worst thing
you can do to your body.

677
01:04:12,035 --> 01:04:14,735
- See?
- Hey, Johnny, let's have it.

678
01:04:15,035 --> 01:04:20,135
I'll be late for target practice.
There's an opera letting out.

679
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:25,335
- All right, here it is. I'm going legit.
- Le-what?

680
01:04:25,635 --> 01:04:26,735
- Legit.
- Le-why?

681
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:30,735
I'll tell you le-why.
Le-cause Johnny Dangerously...

682
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:34,135
...is really Johnny Kelly,
brother of the DA, Tommy Kelly.

683
01:04:38,435 --> 01:04:44,235
Johnny, is this true? Because if it is,
I don't know how to react.

684
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:48,135
Yeah, kid, it is true.

685
01:04:48,435 --> 01:04:52,935
Tommy Kelly is my brother.
And you know what? I'm proud of him.

686
01:04:53,335 --> 01:04:56,235
Sure you're proud of him.
You've been working with him...

687
01:04:56,535 --> 01:05:00,435
...helping his career. And now that he's
on top, you're running out on us.

688
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:04,635
You know something, Johnny,
you don't care about crime.

689
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,035
I don't care about crime?

690
01:05:09,335 --> 01:05:13,135
I've devoted my entire life to crime
since I was 12 years old.

691
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:18,135
I just think we ought to relax,
that's all, and enjoy what we got.

692
01:05:18,535 --> 01:05:22,935
We got plenty. Fellas,
I'm closing this store up for good.

693
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:27,035
Well, I’m reopening it
under new management.

694
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:31,435
Oh, no, you're not,
because you don't have the keys.

695
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:35,235
And I do. And I’m turning them
over to the crime commissioner.

696
01:05:35,535 --> 01:05:40,735
And us with them, huh, Johnny?
I knew it, he's turning squealer.

697
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:47,035
You know, I’m bored
with slapping you around.

698
01:05:47,535 --> 01:05:49,935
It bores me.

699
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:57,135
Don't worry, fellas,
you guys are in the clear.

700
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:58,735
It's me they're after.

701
01:06:03,635 --> 01:06:06,935
Dirty Jew! Shanty nigger!
White-trash bastard!

702
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:11,135
Go ahead, walk all over
the little people!

703
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:29,235
Commissioner, there's all the evidence
against me, just like I promised you.

704
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:33,535
Use it.
I'm ready to pay my debt.

705
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:37,635
Hey, how about a thank-you?

706
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:41,235
Hey, how about me getting out of here?

707
01:06:41,635 --> 01:06:45,235
Hey, how about me getting knocked out?

708
01:06:57,135 --> 01:07:00,735
I'd love to stick around and see how
this whole thing turns out...

709
01:07:01,035 --> 01:07:03,135
...but I got a new store to open.

710
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:24,535
Oh, you lousy, Wop, Slovak, Chink, Jap,
Polack, Mick, Krauts, Hebe fags!

711
01:07:25,035 --> 01:07:29,335
- Hi, doll. What's your name?
- Mary Margaret Catherine Dineen.

712
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:33,335
- How'd you like to make some money?
- One at a time or both together?

713
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:37,635
How much for you to clean room 708
and forget you ever saw us?

714
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:41,835
- $17,000.
- All right, 17 grand it is.

715
01:07:42,235 --> 01:07:46,535
Do us a big favor and forget
we ever gave you this money, huh?

716
01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:50,435
- What money?
- Attagirl.

717
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:57,335
One at a time. One at a time.

718
01:07:57,635 --> 01:08:01,235
- Did you do it?
- You know better than to ask me that.

719
01:08:01,635 --> 01:08:06,535
- Why did they find a gun in your hand?
- I've been framed like the Mona Lisa.

720
01:08:06,935 --> 01:08:08,235
John!
- Yeah, Duffy?

721
01:08:08,435 --> 01:08:09,935
What were you doing there?

722
01:08:10,235 --> 01:08:13,135
- I was there to tell him I was going legit.
- Le-what?

723
01:08:13,535 --> 01:08:16,735
Legit, as in legitimate.

724
01:08:16,935 --> 01:08:19,135
Hey, Johnny, can we get a picture?

725
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:22,935
Sure, why not?
It's the first picture ever taken of me...

726
01:08:23,235 --> 01:08:25,335
...so make it a good one.

727
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:30,535
All right. Thank you.

728
01:08:35,735 --> 01:08:38,835
Empty your pockets, Johnny.

729
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:48,535
Wait a minute, my cigarette case.
I can't find my cigarette case.

730
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:50,735
- Maybe it's in another suit.
- No.

731
01:08:51,035 --> 01:08:53,635
- Did you leave it in your car?
- No.

732
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:56,935
Sometimes when I shave,
I put it on the sink.

733
01:08:57,135 --> 01:09:01,235
No, it's my good luck piece.
I never go anywhere without it.

734
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:04,335
Whoever has my cigarette case
bumped off the commissioner.

735
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:10,335
Excuse me. Johnny, I came as soon
as I heard. I brought your bail money.

736
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:15,135
I hate to disappoint you, little lady.
Johnny's being held without bail.

737
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:16,835
By whose orders?

738
01:09:17,135 --> 01:09:19,335
The man who's gonna prosecute you...

739
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:22,735
...the DA himself.

740
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:26,935
I suppose this is what
you call going legit?

741
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:32,435
I was set up. Find my cigarette case
and you'll find the guy who did it.

742
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,535
Oh, come on. There are a million
cigarette cases out there.

743
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:38,235
But only one has a
bullet dent and smells like gum.

744
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,635
Johnny, don't say anything
until you get a lawyer.

745
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:45,435
- I can handle my own brother.
- Wait a minute. You mean you and he...?

746
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:49,035
- That's right. Me and him is brothers.
- We were brothers.

747
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:50,835
Brothers!

748
01:09:51,135 --> 01:09:54,535
Hey, wait. Hey!

749
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:58,935
Yo!

750
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,135
- Is that the city edition?
- What?

751
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:12,635
I said, is that the city edition?

752
01:10:12,935 --> 01:10:18,935
Oh, no. Son of a bitch.
Now I’m deaf.

753
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,935
He's guilty. He's guilty!

754
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:37,335
Mrs. Kelly.

755
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:40,635
- Get this side. It's my best side.
- Anything to say?

756
01:10:40,935 --> 01:10:45,735
Truthfully, I’ve got mixed feelings.
Thrilled for Tommy, sad for Johnny.

757
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:51,435
Sorry, fellas, no comment. This is
the toughest thing I’ve ever had to do.

758
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:54,935
I'm sure you boys can understand.

759
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:59,935
Nice work in there Mr. DA.
Allow me to introduce myself.

760
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,635
I'm Danny Vermin.
I was associated with your brother.

761
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,035
I just want to thank you personally
for sending him to the hot seat.

762
01:11:11,035 --> 01:11:14,335
Watch this. Johnny taught me this.

763
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:19,435
You shouldn't kick me in the balls.

764
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:23,435
My sister kicked me in the balls once.

765
01:11:23,735 --> 01:11:27,735
Look, Mom.
- It's Johnny's cigarette case...

766
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:31,335
...the one he was talking about.
- That's mine.

767
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:36,435
This is my brother's cigarette case.
Johnny didn't do it.

768
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:40,035
I'm gonna get you, Vermin,
if it's the last thing I do.

769
01:11:40,335 --> 01:11:45,435
It just might be, Mr. DA.

770
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:50,435
Johnny ain't guilty.

771
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:54,335
And you sent him to the big house.

772
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:07,235
- It's an honor to have you on death row.
- The pleasure's all mine.

773
01:12:07,635 --> 01:12:10,435
- Hi, pops. Still here, huh?
You bet.

774
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:13,235
They finally got you, huh, Brooklyn?

775
01:12:13,435 --> 01:12:17,635
- Louie. How are you? You look great.
You're beautiful, Johnny.

776
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:24,135
Listen, why don't you go out
and get the boys some quiche.

777
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:34,135
- Johnny, this is my best guard, Tony.
Hi, Tony. How are you?

778
01:12:34,535 --> 01:12:39,835
I think you took a shot at me one time.
Hey, I never forget a gun.

779
01:12:40,335 --> 01:12:43,735
Come on, guys.
We gonna do this or what?

780
01:12:55,935 --> 01:13:01,435
- There's nothing left. Look.
- Finest metal, good holes...

781
01:13:01,935 --> 01:13:04,735
I keep telling you, Howard,
the boy needs a role model.

782
01:13:05,035 --> 01:13:07,335
- Rocky, I’m so horny.
- Me too.

783
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:11,335
Vermin's turning the place into a dive.
It's attracting the worst elements.

784
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,335
- That son of a...
And Johnny...

785
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:16,235
Don't tell me. He put in a salad bar.

786
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:19,935
No. He's making a play for me.

787
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:24,735
Wait a minute,
that's just what we want.

788
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:29,235
I gotta prove he framed me.
Lil, I want you to play up to him.

789
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:33,035
- But, Johnny...
- No "buts. " Keep your eyes and ears open.

790
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:36,735
First thing you hear, you get it
to me on the grapevine. You got it?

791
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:39,935
- Got it.
- Attagirl.

792
01:13:40,235 --> 01:13:42,335
Come here.

793
01:13:48,535 --> 01:13:52,635
Next time, I’ll bring a can opener.
- Good idea.

794
01:13:56,335 --> 01:13:57,335
Yo!

795
01:14:07,135 --> 01:14:09,535
I can hear again, and I can see.

796
01:14:09,835 --> 01:14:13,635
I can hear again, and I can see!

797
01:14:14,335 --> 01:14:16,435
But who am I?

798
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:25,635
Tommy, please take a break
and eat something.

799
01:14:25,935 --> 01:14:31,535
- I won't eat until I save my brother.
- Keep up the good work, Governor Kelly.

800
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:38,735
- It's governor, is it?
- That's just cheap talk, Mom.

801
01:14:39,035 --> 01:14:43,835
Anybody that would send his own
brother to the hot seat gets my vote.

802
01:14:44,335 --> 01:14:47,935
I've been trying night and day
to prove Johnny's innocence.

803
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:52,335
If I leave it to you,
Johnny'll fry in the chair like his father.

804
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:58,135
Well, your old mom just might
have something for you tonight.

805
01:15:09,635 --> 01:15:13,135
Who is it?
Open up. It's Ma Kelly.

806
01:15:14,235 --> 01:15:16,635
- What do you want? Get out of here.
I gotta talk to you.

807
01:15:16,935 --> 01:15:20,535
- We don't have nothing to say.
We've got plenty to say.

808
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:23,235
- We've got a lot in common.
- Like what?

809
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:28,935
We both scrub floors, we're swell
lookers and neither of us is Chinese.

810
01:15:30,035 --> 01:15:33,535
You've been doing your homework.
What do you want?

811
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:36,535
How much will it take
for you to tell the truth?

812
01:15:36,835 --> 01:15:38,035
19,500.

813
01:15:42,635 --> 01:15:45,635
Boy, am I having a good year.

814
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:52,635
What's the matter, you got no manners?

815
01:15:52,935 --> 01:15:54,435
Send me a bill for the door.

816
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:57,035
You don't even wait for the body
to get cold, do you?

817
01:15:57,435 --> 01:15:58,735
I go where the action is.

818
01:15:58,935 --> 01:16:01,535
Where's your mom?
Did you send her up the river too?

819
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:05,835
What do you want, Mr. DA?
And make it quick.

820
01:16:06,235 --> 01:16:10,035
There's a subpoena out for you.
I wanted to serve it myself.

821
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:13,335
- Subpoena? You ain't got a thing on me.
- Oh, no?

822
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,735
Does the name Mary Margaret Catherine
Dineen strike a familiar chord?

823
01:16:18,835 --> 01:16:20,435
- I'm tone deaf.
- Too bad...

824
01:16:20,735 --> 01:16:24,535
...because she's singing like a canary,
and we got her in her own cage.

825
01:16:24,935 --> 01:16:28,335
It's gonna be my pleasure
to send you to the chair.

826
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:31,235
Come on, boys. Let's go.

827
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:35,135
I don't like the smell in here.

828
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:40,935
The cleaning dame will spill her guts,
and we can't get to her.

829
01:16:41,135 --> 01:16:44,035
- But we can get to him.
- How, boss?

830
01:16:44,435 --> 01:16:47,235
Don't you listen to the radio?

831
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:50,535
The governor and DA
Kelly will attend the premiere of the new...

832
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:52,735
...James Cagney movie tomorrow night.

833
01:16:53,935 --> 01:16:57,035
Should be clear skies tomorrow night as
the governor and DA Tommy Kelly...

834
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:59,335
...attend the new James Cagney movie.

835
01:16:59,935 --> 01:17:01,735
Which theater?

836
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:04,335
The Savoy, on 37th.

837
01:17:04,535 --> 01:17:08,935
It'll be like shooting ducks in a pond.
Once we knock the DA off...

838
01:17:09,335 --> 01:17:13,935
...that cleaning dame
will clam up just fine.

839
01:17:16,535 --> 01:17:18,435
Get this to Johnny on the grapevine:

840
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:22,635
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's brother
at the Savoy theater tomorrow night.

841
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:25,935
- Got it?
Got it.

842
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:37,035
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
brother at the Savoy theater. Pass it on.

843
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:40,835
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
brother at the Savoy. Pass it on.

844
01:17:41,135 --> 01:17:44,135
Vermin's going to kill Johnny's
mother at the Savoy. Pass it on.

845
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:47,435
Vermin's mother is gonna kill Johnny
at the Savoy. Pass it on.

846
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:55,335
- Urgent message through the grapevine.
- Yeah? What is it?

847
01:17:55,635 --> 01:18:00,335
Johnny and the Mothers are playing
"Stomping at the Savoy" in Vermont.

848
01:18:00,735 --> 01:18:03,435
Vermin's gonna kill my brother
at the Savoy theater tonight.

849
01:18:03,735 --> 01:18:07,935
- I didn't say that.
- No, but I know this grapevine.

850
01:18:08,335 --> 01:18:11,135
I gotta get out of here.

851
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:16,235
Guard! Come here!

852
01:18:17,435 --> 01:18:22,235
- Yeah?
- Smell that food. I think it's rotten.

853
01:18:43,335 --> 01:18:48,035
- What's all this about, Johnny?
- I can't take it anymore! I'm cracking up!

854
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:52,235
Fry me tonight!
The waiting's driving me crazy!

855
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:56,435
- You've still got two more weeks.
- I don't want them!

856
01:18:56,735 --> 01:19:00,535
- Fry me tonight!
- Okay, Johnny. Anything for you.

857
01:19:01,435 --> 01:19:06,235
We'll bump Steinberg.
Dangerously will go to the chair tonight.

858
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:16,735
Everyone who is
anyone is here tonight...

859
01:19:17,035 --> 01:19:22,235
...including Mr. Crime Fighter himself,
District Attorney Tommy Kelly.

860
01:19:22,735 --> 01:19:25,235
They're talking about you as
our next governor.

861
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:30,635
That's nice, but right now all I care
about is proving my brother's innocence.

862
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:35,635
Johnny, if you're listening,
I love you.

863
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:50,935
Your turn, Johnny.
The priest you requested has arrived.

864
01:19:52,735 --> 01:19:58,135
Are you ready, my son?
- I'm ready if you are, Father.

865
01:20:09,135 --> 01:20:11,935
So long, Johnny.
Me gust of us. You gust of us.

866
01:20:12,735 --> 01:20:15,235
We missed the bus.
They missed the bus.

867
01:20:15,735 --> 01:20:17,535
Be brave, Johnny.
- When's the next bus?

868
01:20:17,835 --> 01:20:21,935
- Always, Nails.
- Summa cum laude. Magna cum laude.

869
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:24,535
The radio's too laude.

870
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:28,835
Good luck, Johnny.
Semper fidelis. High fidelis.

871
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:33,335
- Why didn't I take shop?
- Post meridian. Ante meridian.

872
01:20:33,735 --> 01:20:36,835
Uncle Meridian.
All the little Meridians.

873
01:20:37,235 --> 01:20:39,535
Goodbye, Johnny.
Goodbye, Rock.

874
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:44,435
- The Magna Carta. Master Charge you.
Spit in his eye, Johnny.

875
01:20:44,835 --> 01:20:49,135
- You bet, Rabbi.
- Doom procelus. Lots of Vitalis.

876
01:20:51,235 --> 01:20:53,235
Do you have any last words, Johnny?

877
01:20:56,535 --> 01:20:57,635
Well said!

878
01:21:04,435 --> 01:21:07,835
Okay, warden. This is where
we say our goodbyes.

879
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:10,435
- Come on.
- Johnny?

880
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:15,135
- You weren't gonna kill me, were you?
What? With this?

881
01:21:28,335 --> 01:21:29,935
Calling all cars...

882
01:21:30,235 --> 01:21:32,935
...Johnny Dangerously has just
escaped from state prison.

883
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:38,535
Hey, ace. Could I have a popcorn,
Milk Duds and a white fish?

884
01:21:56,235 --> 01:22:00,835
- When we gonna give it to him?
- When Cagney gets his in the movie...

885
01:22:01,335 --> 01:22:04,035
...a few minutes from now.

886
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:07,635
Calling all cars, be on the lookout
for Johnny Dangerously...

887
01:22:07,935 --> 01:22:10,535
...and two accomplices in a black sedan.

888
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:13,235
I repeat: in a black sedan.

889
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:16,635
A black sedan, huh?
We'll just see about that.

890
01:22:16,935 --> 01:22:21,435
- I hope this works.
- It always does at home, Johnny.

891
01:22:21,935 --> 01:22:25,035
Come on, shelf paper.

892
01:22:28,635 --> 01:22:30,035
Get back and don't bug me.

893
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:34,435
Get out of the way, boss.

894
01:22:57,835 --> 01:23:01,735
Calling all cars, Johnny Dangerously
now driving a white sedan...

895
01:23:02,035 --> 01:23:04,235
...disguised as a trout fisherman.

896
01:23:04,935 --> 01:23:08,235
Johnny, we've been spotted.

897
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:12,435
Peel the next layer.

898
01:23:15,335 --> 01:23:19,935
- Someday it'll be in Johnny Jr. 's room.
- Sure. Sure.

899
01:23:20,335 --> 01:23:21,835
There he goes. Get him.

900
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:25,935
Don't let him
get away. He knows too much.

901
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:31,835
Calling all cars,
be on the look out for...

902
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:37,635
...Dangerously and accomplices dressed
as nuns, driving a sedan covered with...

903
01:23:38,035 --> 01:23:40,835
...you'll love this, duckies and bunnies.

904
01:23:41,635 --> 01:23:44,035
Calling all cars...

905
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:46,735
...come to Dooley's Bar and Grill.
I'm buying.

906
01:23:54,635 --> 01:23:57,935
There's something
you don't see every day.

907
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:03,235
- Everybody stay where you are.
- Alice, keep down.

908
01:24:14,035 --> 01:24:18,135
You might as well come down,
Pembroke. There's no one left but you.

909
01:24:29,035 --> 01:24:30,535
Ah. Shit.

910
01:24:37,635 --> 01:24:42,235
- Johnny, are you okay?
- Sure, kid, I’m fine. How about you?

911
01:24:42,635 --> 01:24:46,935
- You didn't get hit, did you?
- I don't think so.

912
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,435
Boy, does that thing come in handy.

913
01:24:50,235 --> 01:24:53,035
Johnny, you were gonna take
the bullet for me.

914
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,935
Actually, I was counting
on a lot of missing.

915
01:24:56,235 --> 01:24:57,135
Oh, Johnny.

916
01:24:57,435 --> 01:24:58,535
Johnny!

917
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:02,835
Sorry, Johnny, I have to take you
back to the big house.

918
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:04,135
No!

919
01:25:04,435 --> 01:25:08,535
Mr. Governor, I have a witness to clear
my brother. That's the man you want.

920
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:14,735
Officer, you can release this man.
I'm granting him a full pardon.

921
01:25:17,235 --> 01:25:19,635
Thanks, gov.

922
01:25:20,435 --> 01:25:25,635
You shouldn't shoot me, Johnny.
My grandmother shot me once.

923
01:25:26,035 --> 01:25:29,235
Oh, Johnny, darling,
you must be exhausted.

924
01:25:29,635 --> 01:25:32,735
Breaking out of prison,
racing here in the nick of time...

925
01:25:33,035 --> 01:25:37,235
...and saving your brother's life.
I'd say you had a full day.

926
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:42,835
Funny, Ma, I’m not even very tired.
It must have been that little nap.

927
01:25:43,235 --> 01:25:46,835
I'll have some stories
to tell my grandchildren...

928
01:25:47,235 --> 01:25:49,935
...if I have any.

929
01:25:50,935 --> 01:25:54,535
Lil, what do you say we start
a little gang of our own?

930
01:25:54,835 --> 01:25:57,935
- That be okay with you?
- Johnny, I like it.

931
01:25:58,335 --> 01:26:02,335
Kid, I’m gonna make you love it.

932
01:26:07,235 --> 01:26:11,435
So that's my story.
I hope you learned something from it.

933
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:16,835
I sure did. Wow, the electric chair.
Boy, from now on, I’m going straight.

934
01:26:17,235 --> 01:26:20,235
See to it that you do,
or I’m coming after you.

935
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:22,535
Get out of here.

936
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:27,235
Wait a minute,
aren't you forgetting something?

937
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,535
There you go.

938
01:26:35,835 --> 01:26:38,635
Thanks, Mr. Kelly.

939
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:42,335
Hey, kid, don't forget...

940
01:26:42,735 --> 01:26:45,335
...crime doesn't pay.
Right.

941
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:51,035
Johnny!

942
01:26:59,535 --> 01:27:02,235
Well, it paid a little.
