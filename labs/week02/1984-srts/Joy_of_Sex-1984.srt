I will now come around
to every couple

160
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,555
and give you your very
own bread molds.

161
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,757
[class groaning and laughing]

162
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,992
[girl] Hey, it's lunch time!

163
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,928
[boy] Got any peanut butter mold
to go with this?

164
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,498
[indistinct chatter]

165
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,168
[boy] Uh, salami mold,
some lettuce mold?

166
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,103
-[Carp choking]
-[laughs]

167
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,606
[whispering]
Look who's comin'.

168
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,009
Alan, will you light
my Bunsen burner?

169
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,879
I don't think I can
handle it alone.

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,083
[mocking] "Alan, would you
light my Bunsen burner?"

171
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,754
-[class screaming]
-[metal clattering]

172
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,690
-[teacher whimpers]
-[body thudding]

173
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,229
Three times a dollar fifty
is four-fifty, right?

174
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,598
-Mm-hmm.
-Think they'll stay out later?

175
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,301
Jenny, did you put
that in the washer?

176
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,538
It's my bra!
She snitched my bra!

177
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,006
-It fits.
-You wish.

178
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:00,740
Take it off, Jenny.

179
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,642
You'll get a training bra
when you're thirteen.

180
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,245
I'm the only one in PE
who still wears an undershirt.

181
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,881
I didn't get a bra
till I was fourteen.

182
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,285
Nobody escorted me
on my first babysitting job.

183
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,120
But your father drove
by the house every hour.

184
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,023
Only to make sure no boys
were hiding in the bushes.

185
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:22,562
If Dixie-D cup doesn't move it,
we're gonna be late! Jenny!!

186
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,229
You don't have to shout.

187
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,098
-[sports commentary on TV]
-Whoa, there!

188
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,067
What about dinner?

189
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,101
I'm on a diet.

190
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,003
Sounds like anorexia to me.

191
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,606
Does your pitiful existence
have to revolve

192
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,107
around bugging me, twit-brain?

193
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,610
Mom! She called me a twit-brain.

194
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,646
[sighs] There are better words
in the dictionary, Leslie.

195
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,348
What kind of people
are these Stonemans?

196
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,952
Who cares? We're spending
the evening with their infant.

197
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,989
I'll call you every hour or so,
make sure everything's A-OK!

198
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,625
-[Leslie] Bye!
-[Jenny] Bye!

199
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,727
[TV advertiser]
...because you never know

200
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,662
if you'll take a blow.

201
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,898
It's so quiet
when the girls are gone.

202
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,603
[TV advertiser] You'll get
that 24-hour protection
and comfort...

203
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,974
[snack packaging crunching]

204
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,815
[rock music playing inside bar]

205
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,723
[Alan] So, then she asked me
to light her Bunsen burner.

206
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,158
-Is that a good sign?
-Sounds hot to me.

207
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,828
What, are you waiting
for a formal invitation?

208
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,897
Maybe bio's her bad subject
or something.

209
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,934
My own brother,
a sexual retard.

210
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,070
All I think about
all day is sex.

211
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,271
That's a good sign.

212
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,375
I look at everybody and I think:
"They know what it's like."

213
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:47,380
I've got this huge black hole
in my life, you know?

214
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,215
No.

215
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,985
Why aren't girls as horny
as I am? It's just not fair.

216
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,753
[Dinko] What can I say?

217
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,023
Sex is a stacked deck
and women hold all the cards.

218
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,991
Better get used to it.

219
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,860
Dinko.

220
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,432
'Bout time I put this goddamn
machine out of its misery.

221
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,839
Bad attitude.

222
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,107
Good arm.

223
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,976
[Dinko]
Feelin' better, Sunshine?

224
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,078
I wish I was dead.

225
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,118
[Ranada] Well, Doctor Ranada's
got just your prescription.

226
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,854
Look, I just tossed
my cookies, okay?

227
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,224
I mean, enough is enough.
Really!

228
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:38,397
She's a slow starter,
but there's a tiger in her tank.

229
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,334
That guy wrote the book
on how to strike out.

230
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,036
Bet he's been laid though.

231
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,405
Your time will come,
think positive.

232
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,307
Now, what about
your bio partner?

233
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,110
Leslie Hindenberg's
my bio partner.

234
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,978
Coach Kong's daughter?

235
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,480
Hope she's not built
like her old man.

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,950
-Oh, no, she's a fox!
-Well, so, hit on her.

237
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,788
You're right.
I like your nose where it is.

238
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,458
These are supposed to be
the best years of my life.

239
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,194
[Melanie] Maybe if you went
blonde, or something.

240
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,864
We'd still be stuck
with the same geeky guys.

241
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,966
Wait a minute, Les,
I see a ray of hope.

242
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,938
God, the man of my dreams
is alive and well on KBBZ.

243
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,406
God, what a turn on.

244
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,941
[reporter]
...as he proved late last night

245
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,976
when he rolled his wheelchair
out of the VA hospital

246
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,378
and onto the San Diego
freeway on-ramp.

247
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,180
He's a little too "Ken doll"
for me.

248
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,450
I mean, there's no pain
or passion in his face.

249
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,318
He's too perfect.

250
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,121
Oh, I'm not above perfection.

251
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,890
Ted Vincent is my man.

252
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,359
You won't believe this,
she's got a vibrator.

253
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,060
[vibrator buzzing]

254
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,461
[Melanie]
Good work, Les, she's on a roll.

255
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,197
-What's it for?
-Curling your hair.

256
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,434
[Melanie] I wonder if Ted's
into electronics?

257
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,802
Earth to Les!

258
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,404
Listen, I gotta go.
The Gestapo's gonna be calling,

259
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,108
-checking up on me.
-OK, I'll catch you later.

260
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,321
Cancer?

261
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,041
[indistinct chatter]

262
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
It's no joke, Mel!

263
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,381
It looks exactly like
a classic melanoma.

264
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,083
Have you forgotten
your cold last spring?

265
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,285
You swore it was TB.

266
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,320
It was a severe case
of strep, Mel.

267
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
And, besides,
melanoma's different.

268
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,026
For starters,
it's almost always fatal.

269
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,201
I haven't seen
you in a long time.

270
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,368
How's your mother?

271
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,136
-She's fine.
-Good.

272
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:02,041
Now, let me check the, uh...
the area of the mole.

273
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,613
I'm only checking
for raised areas.

274
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,449
Doesn't look like
an ordinary mole does it?

275
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,085
Don't be an alarmist, Leslie.

276
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,155
I'm only checking
for coloration.

277
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,891
Oh...

278
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,126
Looks pretty dark
and sinister, huh?

279
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,029
Now, now, Leslie,
although you're fair-skinned

280
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,032
and prone
to the ill-fated melanoma...

281
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,602
-this is only lentigo.
-Huh?

282
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,205
Medical terminology
for harmless spots.

283
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,073
Prone to melanoma?

284
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:38,010
Leslie, you're a very healthy
young lady who worries too much.

285
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,445
You can get dressed now.

286
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:44,116
But if it would be reassuring,
you could come back in a month

287
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,387
and I'll check
your entire body. Bye.

288
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,558
[doctor] I told you not to buy
plants at gas stations.

289
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,261
[woman crying]
But she looked so healthy!

290
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,328
Maybe if I talk to her...

291
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,197
[doctor] Talking can't save her
now, Bernice.

292
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,632
[Bernice]
But she's not dead yet!

293
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,000
[doctor]
It's only a matter of time.

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,501
Granted, she's got
a great pair of bulbs,

295
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,437
but she's going to wither
and die before the new year.

296
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,307
[Bernice sobbing]

297
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,912
Are you all right, dear?

298
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,480
I guess not.

299
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,116
So, I says to Porter,
if you ask me,

300
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,252
the foreign kid's not playin'
with a full deck.

301
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:26,225
Never knows what team he's on.
Says we all look alike.

302
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,394
Dad, did I ever tell you
how proud I am of you?

303
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,096
I mean, even though I complain
about how embarrassing it is

304
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:36,435
to be in the same school...
everyone respects you so much.

305
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,639
I give it my best shot.

306
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,378
Leslie, your mother makes sure
you get the four basic
food groups,

307
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,547
and you're trashing
three of them.

308
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:54,053
Mom... [laughs]
it's so beautiful that every day

309
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,121
you go to all this effort.

310
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,991
It's just that I've lost
my appetite.

311
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,626
That's very sweet, Leslie.

312
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,461
Also, very suspicious.

313
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,731
Jennifer, you and I have
certainly had our problems.

314
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,301
Would you feel better
if I gave you my new
silver bangles?

315
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,337
The ones I'm not allowed
to breathe on?

316
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,305
Silver bangles aren't worth
fighting over,

317
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,641
no matter how expensive
they are.

318
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,477
-I'll take them!
-You're welcome.

319
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,713
I'll clear the table now.

320
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,721
Am I the only one
who finds this creepy?

321
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,158
[principal on PA]
Your attention, please!

322
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,060
This administration
is not amused...

323
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,431
-[school bell ringing]
-...by the attack on our very
own Venus in the quad.

324
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,100
[Max] You like this shit, huh?

325
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,569
Mm, I like this shit very much.

326
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,538
In America it's considered
the highest of compliments

327
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,008
to say to your hostess
after a good meal:

328
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,542
"Thank you for the shit."

329
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,277
How you-- how you say that?

330
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,546
[speaking slowly]
Thank you for the shit.

331
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,248
Thank you for the shit.

332
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,750
Hello, Farouk.

333
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,186
Some girls go
for the exotic type.

334
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,189
Yeah, Farouk, let us know
if she's a moaner or a screamer.

335
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,693
Hey, I had a screamer once.
She shattered her own glasses.

336
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,129
Don't you talk
about anything but sex?

337
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,097
What else is there, Ed?

338
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,665
That's a tough one, Pittman.

339
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,168
Don't pull a muscle
working on it.

340
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,038
Just stopped by to warn you
that you're Chairman

341
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,240
of the Christmas Dance Committee
this year.

342
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,542
Tell me when you get
the committee put together.

343
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,679
Oh, feel free to resume
your insightful discussion.

344
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,114
Mutant.

345
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,750
Yeah, another example
of virgin brain rot.

346
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,820
Don't let that happen to you,
okay?

347
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,322
How's it goin', Farouk?

348
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,626
Don't look now,
but here comes the lady

349
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,528
that gives new meaning
to the word hard-on.

350
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,498
Uh, this is your lucky day.
I saved this seat just for you.

351
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,368
Sit on it, pal!
Hello, Alan.

352
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,135
Hi.

353
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,072
Say, uh... aren't you
in my bio class?

354
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,705
I hadn't noticed.

355
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,407
Why don't you sit down,
take a seat?

356
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,308
I'm bad but I don't bite.

357
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,344
I do! I definitely bite!
Come on, Alan.

358
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,718
Hey, Alan, who's the guy
with the bow tie?

359
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:11,623
...we've got funds for holidays,
Hawaiian luaus,
Vancouver cruises.

360
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,792
Oh, everybody calls him
Mushroom Malone.

361
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,629
-Mm-hmm. Bet I can guess why.
-[laughs]

362
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:23,268
[principal on PA] Any student
caught with a substance
commonly known as Wacky Glue,

363
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,838
will be subject
to severe disciplinary action.

364
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,640
Score one
for the Wacky Glue Phantom.

365
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,810
[pop music playing in diner]

366
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,715
[Mushroom] I can make you
a great deal, you'll love it.

367
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm not kidding,
it's great stuff!

368
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,487
You'll love it.

369
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,858
It's all so unreal.
I feel like I ought
to do something.

370
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,759
There's nothing
anybody can do now.

371
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,197
I'll just go on pretending
nothing's happened.

372
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,867
Cram a lifetime
into three months.

373
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,735
There's so much
I wanna experience.

374
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,403
-You mean?
-I always said I'd wait

375
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:02,808
for the love of my life,
but I guess I'll have
to settle for...

376
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,675
[both] ...sex!
[laughing]

377
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,579
I gotta know if it's worth
all the time we spend
talking about it.

378
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,683
Bad news, my research
says the first time's
never the best.

379
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,553
Unless you go for someone
really experienced.

380
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,523
It might be sweet if it was
the first time for both of us.

381
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,926
It might be the pits. I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

382
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,829
Yeah, really? Two dozen
Shriners with rubbers?

383
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,834
Later, babe, I think I just saw
a major league pair of yapo.

[Pittman grunts]

00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,212
Let's go.

387
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,284
She's weird!

388
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,686
I hear they call you Mushroom.
Got any?

389
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,922
Wanna speak up?
They didn't hear you in Nevada.

390
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,191
I figured with a name like that
you must be advertising.

391
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,395
Would you sit down? Only takes
one narc to ruin your whole day.

392
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,596
Really?

393
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,302
Gnarly.

394
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,215
[Alan] Doesn't this ever
strike you as absurd?

395
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:16,748
[Max] What?

396
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:21,420
All these adolescents,
desperate for human contact.

397
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,254
[Max]
You mean horny?

398
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,224
[Alan] Isolating themselves
in their own little prisons
on wheels.

399
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,727
Like a thousand lonely little
worlds doing a mating relay

400
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,963
down the highway of life.

[Max]
Hey, catch that, tits and drugs.

402
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,935
[Alan] Give me a break.

403
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,571

[Max]
Pittman, you lunatic.

406
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,409
You know, you think too much,
that's your problem.

407
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,312
You could use a problem
like that, Max.

Fate is calling you, Les,
and getting a busy signal.

Think Max, Leslie.

412
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,558
Oh, sometimes he gets
this look in his eyes.

413
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,362
I mean, this is a man who knows
where to find your G-spot.

414
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,498
Oh, Mel, I couldn't
find my G-spot.

415
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,035
I kissed him once
in the second grade.

416
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,271
Oh, he was hot even then.

417

[Max laughing]

418
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,340
He's not interested
in me, Mel.

419
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,975
Well you gotta be gutsy, Les.

420
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,711
Just call him up
and ask him out.

421
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,747
All he can say is:
"No way, José."

422
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,349
Right, then I just die
of embarrassment.

-How you doin'?

"Is it too much to ask
for someone dark and mysterious,

I guess I'd better face reality,
boys are so immature.

the floor, Farouk?

And I'll get the main dish.

it's your turn to talk.

preparing your favorite
native dish, Farouk.

for this new wrestling mat.

470
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,722
Hit on Hindenberg,
she's the pleasure
and he's the pain.

471
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:22,194
Leslie? I wouldn't kick her out
of bed for eating crackers.

472
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,766
Holt!

473
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,035
Since you don't need
to listen to this,

474
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,004
why don't you demonstrate
a take-down on Pittman?

475
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,975
[laughing] But Coach,
he outweighs me
by a hundred pounds.

476
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,711
-This is ridiculous!
-[Pittman growling]

477
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,680
Easy, I don't wanna hurt you,
Pittman.

478
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,215
[Pittman grunting]

479
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,518
Come on, you guys,
this ain't no sock hop.

480
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,720
-Come on! Come on! Come on!
-Want blood?

481
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,056
[Coach Hindenberg] Get the lead
out, come on now!

482
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,191
-[Alan roaring]
-[Pittman] Shit!

483
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,729
[Pittman] Oh, wow man,
I'm sorry about your face.

484
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,098
Get him off the mat!
Get some towels!

485
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:00,932
Stop that bleeding!

486
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,034
It's too late, Coach,
I think he's dead.

487
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,770
No, you idiot, my mat!

488
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,973
[Alan groaning]

489
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,088
How about it, Max? Do I have
the stuff to be a blue flamer?

490
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,190
Well, you got the gas, Carp.

491
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,758
Uh, how 'bout a car?

492
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,226
Well, Dad says
I can have it back

493
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,861
as soon as I pay
for the paint job.

494
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,098
So, cough up the bucks,
and then we'll talk.

495
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,666
Okay.

496
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:39,304
Alan, do you think your brother
could get me a job
over at the Lorelei?

497
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,606
-Please?
-I'll see what I can do.

498
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:45,176
I can hardly wait to see
what happens when you meet...

499
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,979
the fascinating flatworm.

500
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,282
Like the sea squirt,
it can reproduce asexually.

501
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:54,653
Sometimes, the tail decides not
to follow the head and presto!

502
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,887
-[chalkboard screeching]
-[all groaning]

503
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,657
The worm's torn in two.
This is self-mutilation.

504
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,992
Each part then regenerates
a whole worm.

505
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,796
Reproduction has
taken place asexually.

506
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,830
[door opens]

507
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,165
[boy] Oh, here he is.

508
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,900
Eric March.

509
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,138
Eric March, this is your fourth
tardy this week.

510
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,340
Please go to your lab station
immediately.

511
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,809
Yeah, we be cutting some worms.

512
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,147
Violent effect, man,
real New Wave.

513
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,949
[boys laughing]

514
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,885
Hey, yo, Hindenberg.
Why don't you sit down

515
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,654
and take a load
off your mind?

516
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,121
[fart sound]

517
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,358
-[Pittman cackling]
-Damn it, Pittman!

518
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,192
Mr. Pittman!

519
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:40,999
Mr. Pittman, please.
Please give me that... balloon.

520
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,935
[fart sounds]

521
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,670
[giggling]

522
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,342
You may now begin
to mutilate your flatworms.

523
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,316
So, you're scoping
out the new girl, eh?

524
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:58,950
Who?

525
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,785
The one with the X-rated bod.

526
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,822
[scoffs] No, I was talkin'
to Sharon.

527
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,761
The guy's unconscious,
she's all yours.

528
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,998
You snooze, you lose. Go.

529
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,770
So, what do you
think of Nixon?

530
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,672
So far, it's mayo on white
all the way,

531
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,073
and I thought Cleveland
was straight.

532
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,676
Try eatin' your lunch
on the football field someday.

533
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,379
If the wind's blowin' just right
half the town gets stoned.

534
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,848
How 'bout you, buddy,
do you puff up?

535
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,884
[Alan] No, that stuff
kinda puts me to sleep.

536
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,721
Uh-huh, no puff-puff, huh?
[sniffs]

537
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,423
You always look so spacey.

538
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:42,260
I guess I'm just
naturally hard-- high.

539
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,996
Well, that's okay too,
I guess.

540
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,066
Excuse me, people get stoned

541
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,367
for doing something
such as this?

542
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,270
It seems cruel
and unusual punishment.

543
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,440
No, Farouk, getting stoned
is like smoking pot.

544
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,342
-Grass?
-Yeah.

545
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,677
Oh.

546
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,880
My dad was talking
about you last night.

547
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,782
He said you're pro material.

548
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,449
Yeah, I have a good arm.

549
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:08,820
He says you really stand out,
a real team leader.

550
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,354
He said that?

551
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,289
[scoffs] He treats me
like pond scum

552
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,991
'cause I won't go out
for football.

553
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,225
Oh, you've got it all wrong.

554
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,028
You remind him of him
when he was younger.

555
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,329
He really likes you.

556
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,431
Could have fooled me.

557
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,233
So, I was thinking that
if you're not doing anything

558
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,769
Friday night,
maybe we could go out.

559
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:29,474
Yeah, that sounds okay, except
that my Trans-Am's in the shop.

560
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,178
That's OK, I'll pick you up
in my vulva-- Volvo.

561
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,980
In that case, you're on.

562
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,021
Her vulva! [chuckles]

563
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,725
So, how'd you make out with Liz?

564
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,227
-I think she's a loadie.
-So?

565
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,229
Just can't get the hang
of these worms.

566
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,899
There's less resistance
when they're semi-conscious.

567
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:01,973
[TV announcer] We now return
to... Sands of Time.

568
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,344
[character on TV] Why, Matt.
This is a surprise.
Can I get you a drink?

569
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,848
Max? Max, I need
to talk to you, honey.

570
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,783
I am very concerned
about Farouk.

571
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,019
-[Max sighs]
-He's been slightly
under the weather lately.

572
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,057
And... and I'm afraid he feels
somehow different
from the rest of you boys.

573
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,494
Face it, Mom,
how many guys at Nixon
pray during fourth period?

574
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:26,464
Well, as his AFS sponsor,
I can't help feeling responsible

575
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,533
for the way he'll remember
the United States.

576
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,137
These are impressions
he will carry with him for life.

577
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,539
Perhaps you should ask him
to join your bridge club.

578
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,208
I want you to take him
with you tonight, Max.

579
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,443
I have a date tonight!

580
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,477
And I don't know
about in Abu Dhabi,

581
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,481
but in the good old USA,
only two people at a time
go on a date.

582
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,885
Farouk hasn't had one single
date since he's been here, Max.

583
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:50,188
Well, I can't imagine why.
He's had more offers
in three weeks

584
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,023
than I've had
in three years.

585
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,959
Please. Reach out, Max.

586
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,896
[Max's mother]
Oh, hello, you must be Leslie.

587
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,197
Hi, Mrs. Holt.

588
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,201
-Hi, Max.
-Hi.

589
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,471
You mind if Farouk joins us?

590
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:15,013
In Abu Dhabi,
women sit in ass of car.

591
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,382
Fascinating, Farouk.

592
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,122
[Farouk]
Peaceful pastures.

593
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:43,875
Is this our destination?

594
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,145
Ah, yes, Peaceful Pastures.
Max tell me all about
this place.

595
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,880
It's where people come,
park the car

596
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,882
and make sneaky sex, no?

597
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,518
[chuckles]
You might not believe this,

598
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:58,022
but I come here a lot
to meditate about life
and death.

599
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,925
Could we talk
about something else?

600
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,568
[Farouk humming]

601
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,607
Um, in Abu Dhabi,
we have a game.

602
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:20,945
It's called, uh, how you
say... "Sit on the Bottle."

603
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,114
Farouk, isn't it prayer time
in Abu Dhabi?

604
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,450
No, no, no, no,
sun is down.

605
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,585
It's up in Abu Dhabi.

606
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:31,522
Oh, oh, okay,
I get you now, Max.

607
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,290
I go pray.

608
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,494
I go pray the coach
not find out. [laughs]

609
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,534
I thought he'd never
take the hint.

610
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,904
Let's not waste
any more time.

611
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,304
[Max grunts]

612
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:51,542
Uh, Leslie, uh, this might not
be the time to mention it but...

613
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,511
[chuckles] Um...

614
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,515
Your father said that he would
castrate anybody
that laid a hand on you.

615
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,983
Oh, you know he didn't mean it.

616
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:02,687
Oh. Well, um,
me and the guys,

617
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,255
we weren't sure.

618
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,157
Max, we're all alone.

619
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,993
We may never pass
this way again.

620
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,562
Let's not talk about Daddy.

621
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,568
[Farouk whistling]

622
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,106
[animal howling]

623
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,648
[body thudding]

00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,209
Mmm, how romantic.

781
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,143
What happened to foreplay?

782
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:25,983
The finale of this oceanic orgy.
Yes, class, unfortunately,

783
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,518
all the squid expire.

784
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,788
Hey, Max, sounds like
you and Hindenberg.

785
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,590
[teacher] Lights.

786
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,958
Mr. Pittman.

787
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,828
Simply breathtaking,
gave me goose pimples.

788
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,264
Almost makes you
wanna be a squid.

789
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,568
All right, class, let's get
to our lab stations.

790
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,140
Hey, Liz, where's your retainer?

791
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,976
[Liz]
Shut up, kid!

792
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,912
Max, Pittman says
the Blue Flamers

793
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,982
are having their meeting
at the drive-in this weekend.

794
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:58,249
So?

795
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:02,753
Well, I paid off the paint job.
I can get my dad's car!

796
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,989
Well, we'll take that
into consideration, Carp,

797
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:05,890
whenever we discuss membership.

798
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,959
All right, class,
today you'll start dissecting

799
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,693
your very own squid.

800
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,863
After removing its mantle,
be sure to determine its sex.

801
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,133
And class, please be very
careful with the gonads.

802
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,868
They're quite delicate.

803
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,303
You actually ate one of those?

804
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:23,240
Ah, squid.
It's very good with ink.

805
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,675
I'll try anything, once.

806
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,311
Anything? I'll take you up
on that this weekend.

807
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,281
You mean, like go out
or somethin'?

808
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,181
Well, I was thinking about it.

809
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,784
There's something I'd like
to talk to you about, alone.

810
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,220
It may be important.
It's very important.

811
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,656
It's more important
than you think.

812
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,659
-Friday night okay?
-Perfect.

813
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,765
[dial tone]

814
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,199
[woman] Hello?

815
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,135
Hello, may I please speak
to Richard?

816
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,236
[woman]
Just a minute, dear.

817
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,672
-[door opening]
-[Jenny] Les?

818
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,676
[Leslie]
Hello, Richard?

819
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,245
Hi, this is Leslie Hindenberg.

820
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,248
Yeah, long time no see.

821
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,584
The reason I'm calling is...

822
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:11,188
I got to thinkin' about how much
fun we used to have together.

823
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,325
And I thought maybe you'd like
to get together,

824
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:19,129
you know, for old times' sake.
Like maybe this weekend?

825
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,969
Oh, I think we have lots
to talk about, you know?

826
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,839
-I've matured a lot, Richard.
-[laughing]

827
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,042
Sure, I'll return
your Van Halen records.

828
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,012
Okay, great. I'll see you then.

829
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,147
-Bye.
-Talk about hard up!

830
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,317
Isn't he the one
with the personality
of a bobby-pin?

831
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,120
I've changed, Jennifer,
I'm sure he has too.

832
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,657
Now, get out of here.
Out, out, out!

833
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,093
[groans] Fine!

834
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:56,800
[man in film] Michael,
the girls in the Flower brothel
won't disappoint you.

835
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,902
The car!

836
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,016
Is there something wrong?

837
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,952
Afraid so, Alan. I have
something I have to tell you.

838
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,887
It's Mushroom Malone, isn't it?

839
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,356
No, it's worse than Mushroom.

840
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,661
[funeral music playing]

841
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:34,238
-Is something wrong?
-Just... hold me, Richard.

842
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,209
Leslie, uh....

843
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,714
You used to love it when I...
kissed your neck, remember?

844
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:48,152
And I remember
when you used to kiss my ears.

845
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,320
It drove me crazy.

846
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,057
[Richard] Ow!

847
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,125
When did you pierce your ears?

848
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,294
[Max] Hey, fasten
your seatbelts, Flamers!

849
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,430
I had Brussels sprouts,
baked beans,

850
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,999
-and date bars for dinner.
-[boys yelling]

851
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,468
[Pittman] I had
Swedish meatballs, lentil loaf,

852
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,372
marinated artichokes,
bon-bons with prune whip!

853
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,339
[boys yelling]

854
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,342
Max, tell me now.
What is this Blue Flamers?

855
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:15,846
I'm not who you think I am.
There's a lot you don't
know about me,

856
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,147
a great deal,
very much.

857
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,416
Why pry?
I know all I need to know.

858
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,217
No, you don't know.

859
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,318
-I do know.
-You may not wanna know.

860
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,921
What could I possible know
that would make me know you

861
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,489
better than I know you now?

862
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,193
Alan, I'm a narc.
Police Officer.

863
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,928
When I finish my assignment
at Nixon,

864
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,996
Mushroom and 36 others
are gonna be busted on Monday,

865
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,798
and I'll be starting over again
somewhere else.

866
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:37,034
Another high school,
another district, another town.

867
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,302
That's what it means
to be a narc.

868
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,004
You're the only one I'm gonna
miss when I'm gone, Alan.

869
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,007
Those pill heads and pot heads
deserve what they get.

870
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,310
A one-way ticket to the slammer.

871
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,748
Is anybody gonna know
that it was me?

872
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,515
Not unless you tell 'em.

873
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:55,252
Oh, no chance in hell.
I can keep a secret.

874
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,454
I knew I could trust you, Alan.

875
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,424
And I had to tell you
because, well,

876
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,392
even though I'm 30
and you're 17,

877
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,295
I'm really attracted
to you, Alan.

878
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:06,864
Of course, having sex
with a minor

879
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,266
could get me off the force
and I have my career
to consider.

880
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,303
But honestly, Alan,
I get all hot and weak
when I'm kissing you.

881
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,772
Let's not talk
about wasted youth, Alan.

882
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:20,410
Kiss me again and I'll throw
this badge out the window
and live for the now.

883
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,448
Um, Liz, that is your name,
isn't it?

884
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,485
It's Kathy. Reagan, no relation.

885
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,555
I think I just wanna go home.

886

-[boy 2] Light, light.

To the eternal blue flame.

890

Wait, wait,
I think I've got one.

897
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,557
[Pittman] Oh, shit!

It's probably a little poop!

Yeah a little poo, yeah!

[man] You're sick!
You guys are sick!

905
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,310
[Leslie] I really wanna
make it up to you.

906
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,278
Leslie, you don't
have to do that.

907
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,280
But I want to, Richard.
I want you.

908
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,086
I want... I wanna let you do
everything I wouldn't
let you do before.

I'm involved with somebody else,
right now.

I don't care if you marry her,
Richard,

913
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,398
I just wanna have you once.

Yes, you can, Richard.

Remember how you used
to always want me to...

917

Don't take it personally, Les.

936
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,310
According to my mom,
a lot of guys these days

937
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,311
can't get it up and get it in.

938
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:11,615
For years, my dad's been
telling me teenage boys
want just one thing.

939
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,250
I always thought
he meant girls.

940
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,954
Hey, Sharon, Miss Bismark
says everyone suits up,

941
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,189
even if you are menstruating.

942
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,324
I hate that word.

943
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:24,094
My mom always says:
"Is Aunt Tilly coming to visit?"

944
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,264
-[both giggle]
-Mine just calls it "the curse."

945
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,999
[Miss Bismark] Girls.

946
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,970
[boys catcalling]

947
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,177
[boys fall silent]

948
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,382
[catcalling resumes]

949
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,629
[Coach Hindenberg]
Wanna catch pneumonia?

950
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,681
Is it my imagination,
or is Sharon Mondo pregnant?

951
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,083
You don't know that for sure.

952
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,420
Oh, yeah.
Maybe it's just a tumor.

953
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,155
Not funny, Mel.

954
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,124
I wonder who the daddy is.

955
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,559
Moby Dick!

956
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,429
[Miss Bismark]
Give it a rest, Pittman!

957
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,664
[whistle blowing]

958
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,800
[fart noises]

959
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,371
That does it, Pittman!
We're gonna see Porter
right now!

960
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,340
[Liz] OK, this is it! D-Day.

961
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,177
[man] All right, but listen now.
I want you to remember
your radio mic.

962
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,280
You got guys sittin' in a van
about two blocks from here,

963
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,449
if you get in any
kind of trouble.

964
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,489
Sharon, what's going on?

965
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,458
Oh, I'm leaving school.

966
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,560
Potatohead acted
like I was contagious.

967
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,831
I said: "Look buddy,
there's no way you're
gonna catch what I've got."

968
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,566
-[Leslie] You're kicked out?
-[Sharon] He said school policy.

969
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,070
Can transfer to night school.
I said: "What about my job
at the med center?"

970
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,305
-He said, take it like a man.
-[police sirens wailing]

971
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,174
That's not fair,
ruin your whole life!

972
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,843
Who's talking fair?
We're in high school.

973
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,845
Correction,
I was in high school.

974
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,848
-So, uh, who's the father?
-Just a guy.

975
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,850
He said:
"I can't deal with this."

976
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,752
I said:
"That's cool with me."

977
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,688
Sharon, you don't have to tell
me this if it's too personal,

978
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,757
but is it any good
the first time?

979
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,794
It wasn't great, but we did
it again and it got better.

980
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,697
Really? Wow.

981
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,200
Do you really want this baby?

982
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,335
Well, part of me says:
"What a drag."

983
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,105
Another part says:
"You're a big girl, Sharon,

984
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,873
you can handle this."
And besides,

985
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,309
then I'll have someone
to talk to.

986
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:52,809
God.

987
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,278
I just wish the father would
call once in a while.

988
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,547
I'll probably never see him
now that I'm out of here.

989
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,118
-[whistle blowing]
-You're not out of here yet!

990
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,320
[Sharon]
What do you mean?

991
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,709
"I've been very selfish.

992
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:29,246
I've been thinking sex was
more important than anything.

993
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,516
I want to leave my mark in this
world and it must be more

994
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,752
than a wet spot
in somebody's backseat."

995
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,327
[Max] Definitely the work
of a genius. But is it art?

996
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,463
Smells like Wacky Glue to me.

997
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,801
[boy] Holy Jesus.

998
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,470
[crowd giggling]

999
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,740
Certainly, Sharon has
a constitutional right
to graduate,

1000
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,276
but she can do that
at night school as I told her.

1001
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,546
But, she's not a threat
to anybody else's education.

1002
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,183
High school is not
a democracy, Leslie!

1003
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,951
Think of it as the Marines.

1004
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,686
Would the Russians
take us seriously

1005
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,822
if we let the non-coms
call the shots? Hell no!

1006
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:16,860
First they'd...
they'd laugh their heads off.

1007
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,429
And then, they'd air-mail
the big one.

1008
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,431
I don't wanna start a war,
Mr. Porter.

1009
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,234
I'd just like to see Sharon
graduate with the rest of us.

1010
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:27,337
[sighs] But you bend over
to accommodate one individual,

1011
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:31,308
and the next thing you know,
you can't sit down for a month!

1012
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,680
You know what's going on
out there?

1013
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,583
No, I don't know.

1014
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,719
[crowd giggling]

1015
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,356
OK.

1016
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,625
[boy groans]

1017
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:49,826
[urine streaming]

1018
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,263
Tears of joy streamed
from little Tammy Larson's
one eye, the other day,

1019
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,399
when Santa Claus paid
an early visit
to her hospital bed.

1020
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,970
Potatohead has no principles,
just regulations.

1021
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,604
Hold it, Les.

1022
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,806
The love of my life
is speaking to me.

1023
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,976
The twinkle in Santa's eye
will be just a memory for Tammy.

1024
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,278
So, there's a man
with principles.

1025
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,346
You can see it in his eyes.

1026
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,447
[reporter]
...may save her sight.

1027
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,482
The Larsons, however,
have already exhausted...

1028
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,484
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

1029
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:14,851
[chuckles]

1030
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,420
[reporter] The lights will get
dimmer and dimmer
for tiny Tammy

1031
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,925
until the final blackout,
unless-- unless you and I...

1032
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,261
[Leslie] I knew you'd
understand, Mr. Vincent.

1033
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,397
It's a tragic story
that needs to be heard.

1034
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,565
Me?

1035
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,900
I'm a highly placed person
at Nixon,

1036
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,970
you can just think
of me as Deep Throat.

1037
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,342
Meet you in person?

1038
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,512
At the Lorelei?
All right.

1039
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,416
Goodbye, Mr. Vincent.

1040
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,018
Ted.

1041
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,820
[laughing] Did you hear that?
He said: "Just call me Ted!"

1042
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,357
Oh, my God! I'm so happy
for you, I could kill you!

1043
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:55,058
[both laughing]

1044
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,494
Oh, God.
What am I going to wear?

1045
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:58,528
Think sophisticated, Les.

1046
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:02,499
If he finds out "highly placed"
means a senior at Nixon,

1047
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,534
he'll never lay a hand on you.

1048
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,703
You think I could pull it off?

1049
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,838
Let him do that.

1050
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,512
[Vincent]
Leslie, I ache for that girl.

1051
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,782
But these days,
it takes a fucking quadriplegic

1052
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,884
to wring those tear ducts
in TV-land.

1053
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,786
But even though
she's not a quad,

1054
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,721
if you'd seen her
cleaning out her locker,

1055
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,558
cleaning out her dreams.
It would break your heart.

1056
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:32,095
Hey, relax, huh? Relax.

1057
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,564
Let's not start a downer here.

1058
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,332
Come on.

1059
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:39,903
Just relax, surrender
to your shoulder blades, Leslie.

1060
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:44,908
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

1061
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,010
Yeah, really.

1062
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,646
Esalen taught me
to feel, Leslie.

1063
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,717
Now, I suck up life
like a new born baby.

1064
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,453
When I make love,
and I make love, Leslie,

1065
00:55:56,453 --> 00:56:02,525
I don't screw anymore,
I go all the way to infinity.

1066
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,962
I think you and I
could find infinity,

1067
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,631
maybe three or four
times tonight.

1068
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:12,902
Excuse me a minute,
I have to use the bathroom.

1069
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,939
Hey, I'll order champagne
for blast-off.

1070
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,807
That would be wonderful.

1071
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:19,809
[growls]

1072
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,612
[pop music playing]

1073
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:27,650
Hey, Mr. Dinko, we ain't runnin'
a day care center here.

1074
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,418
But boss, he's my kid--

1075
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,755
It's okay! Maybe the Sheraton's
a better place
for the Christmas Ball.

1076
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:35,759
[Ranada] Whoa, whoa!
Why didn't you tell me
this was a business call?

1077
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:39,929
-Here, give the kid a drink.
-Hey, 'bout time, Carp.

1078
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,564
302 needs a bottle
of champagne.

1079
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,468
-[Carp] It's halfway there.
-No, it's right here.

1080
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,539
What kind of budget
you workin' with?

1081
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,644
Wow, Ted Vincent!

1082
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,479
There you are, kid.

1083
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,948
-Thanks, sir.
-Hey!

1084
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,619
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

1085
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,635
You know, Leslie...

1086
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,538
people like that pathetic
bellboy think I have everything.

1087
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:27,477
Nobody sees the heartache
that goes with being

And don't worry about the food,

of the town.

to his heart, kid.

-I know where he is.

Carp? Come out, come out,
where ever you are.

1109
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,096
I think he's in the back.

You can't really hear
anything back there.

1112
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,847
Ah, at last.

1113
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,683
I thought maybe you fell in.

I was hoping it would mean
as much to you as it does to me.

so uptight, kid.

You got nothin' to worry about.

1128
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,782
I simply want you to relax,
lay back and enjoy.

take complete charge here.

gonna do is drop the drawers.

That's okay.

You gotta peel the banana
before you can eat it.

You don't mess around,
do you?

but I've seen the heartache
of herpes.

I don't even know why I'm here.

I thought you wanted
to help Sharon.

1142
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,132
I do, but not like this.

1143
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,769
[sighs] Now, look.
You do for me and I do for you.

is all about.

Oh, please, don't.
I really never thought
it would come to this.

anything yet.

I'm 17-years-old,
Mr. Vincent,

1150
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,050
and you can take it to Uranus!

1151

You're 17?

1152
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,152
And even if I never turn 18,

1153
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,020
I'm gonna get Sharon
back in school,

1154
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,121
with or without your help!

1155
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,024
Hey, now, look,
there's no need to panic.

1156
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,293
You know, I'm dying to do
that story on your friend.

1157
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:41,264
Pregnant teenager, no future.
Wow! What a hook!

1158
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,199
Do you think I can get
some air in here?

1159

how to kill a mood, kid.

for the atmosphere.

That's okay, kid!

you know where to find me.

a ticket to paradise.

Uh, just lookin' for the Carp.

when you need him.

Um, my Aunt Tilly's
coming to visit.

She's a cleanliness fanatic.
I was checking the rooms.

Yeah, I guess so. Hey, you want
me to walk you to your car?

jump you in a place like this.

and now we'll never know.

1194
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:40,249
I've obtained a delightful film
on the reproductive system
of the horny toad.

perhaps someone other than I

01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,303
might hoist the projector
into place.

Pay close attention
when the male mounts
the female's back.

Sharon attends classes
at the med center.

1245
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,046
She is intelligent,
she is ambitious,

1246
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:26,248
she is also pregnant.
And there's the rub.

1247
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:30,386
It seems that the school system
would rather see Sharon
on the welfare role,

1248
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,387
than attending classes at Nixon.

1249
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:35,424
Does the school system care
that this destroys her dreams

1250
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,325
of a career in health services?

1251
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,060
But Sharon's classmates do.

to our attention.

Miss Hindenberg,

01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:48,637
why, in this age of apathy,
you cared enough
to get involved?

It just didn't seem important.

1261
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,119
I think what Miss Hindenberg
is trying to say

1262
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,554
is that she had the compassion
to put her own future

1263
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:06,789
on the line for her friend.

Not many of us
