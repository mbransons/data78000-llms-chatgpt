1
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,620
THANK YOU.

2
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,587
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

3
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:24,282
HI,
IT'S SUSAN BERLANGER.

4
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,318
HAVE I GOT ANY MESSAGES?

5
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:29,390
MR. SCHNEIDER CALLED
FROM NEW YORK.

6
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,013
PARIS AND AMSTERDAM
ARE SET,

7
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:35,120
AND ROME IS
A STRONG POSSIBILITY.

8
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,535
ANYTHING ELSE?

9
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,503
FRANK CALLED
FROM DALLAS.

10
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,643
HE'LL BE BACK FRIDAY.

11
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,990
THINK ABOUT
WHAT HE ASKED YOU.

12
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,958
HE'S GOING BACK
TO DALLAS SOON.

13
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:49,169
IF YOU'RE
GOING TO DO IT,

14
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:51,930
YOU SHOULD DO IT
BEFORE THEN.

15
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:57,142
YOUR CALLS ARE ALMOST
AS INTERESTING AS A HOOKER'S.

16
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,179
OH, THANKS.

17
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:03,286
JACK WANTS TO KNOW

18
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,841
IF YOU'LL MEET HIM
FOR COFFEE.

19
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,154
ONE SHOULDN'T DATE
HER ANSWERING SERVICE.

20
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,329
IT'S LIKE DATING
YOUR GYNECOLOGIST.

21
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,089
WHY'S THAT?

22
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,022
YOU KNOW TOO MUCH
ABOUT ME.

23
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:17,645
WE'VE NEVER MET.

24
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:19,889
I LOVE YOUR VOICE.

25
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,718
MY VOICE
LOVES YOU, TOO.

26
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,618
GOOD NIGHT, JACK.

27
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,137
I'M NOT FRESCHETTI'S
KIND OF DANCER.

28
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:33,730
IF I STAY, I'LL BE
IN THE CORPS FOREVER.

29
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,560
WHEN THE SEASON'S OVER,
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK

30
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,251
TO TRY MY LUCK.

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,910
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

32
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,878
YOU NEVER FALL
INTO THE PIT,

33
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:49,436
SO YOU MUST BE
PRETTY GOOD.

34
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,610
I MEAN, I CAN'T DANCE
LIKE YOU PLAY THE FLUTE.

35
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,992
I PLAY ALL RIGHT.

36
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,373
I DON'T KNOW WHY

37
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,720
YOU STAY IN THE PIT
WITH YOUR TALENT.

38
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,412
THIS AGENT
IS BOOKING ME

39
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:05,037
EUROPEAN RECITALS.

40
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:09,904
I'D HAVE TO PAY
MY EXPENSES.

41
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,009
IF I GET
GOOD REVIEWS,

42
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:11,975
HE'LL BOOK ME
SOME HEAVY DATES HERE.

43
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,150
THEN THE BIG BUCKS?

44
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,912
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT IT ANYMORE.

45
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,259
DON'T YOU WISH

46
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:21,157
SOMEONE WOULD
CARRY YOU OFF

47
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,021
AND TAKE CARE
OF YOU?

48
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,023
THE ONLY GUYS
WHO EVER CARRY ME OFF

49
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,612
ARE WEARING TIGHTS
AND EYE SHADOW.

50
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,925
HAD ANY PROPOSALS
LATELY?

51
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:31,926
FRANK.

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,758
HE LEFT A MESSAGE
ON MY SERVICE.

53
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:39,002
HOW ROMANTIC.

54
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,383
HE'S PRESSING ME
TO SET A DATE.

55
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,937
YOU CERTAINLY
SEEM EXCITED.

56
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:47,114
IT'S A BIG DECISION.

57
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,944
ALL THIS CAREER TALK
MAKES ME HAVE TO PEE.

58
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,655
HI.

59
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,173
HELLO.

60
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:16,799
LISTEN, UH, IS YOUR FRIEND
COMING BACK?

61
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:17,627
LISA?

62
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:19,146
MMM-HMM.

63
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,148
I'LL DO THIS FAST.

64
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,667
DO WHAT?

65
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:27,879
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO SAY YES.

66
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:29,225
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

67
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:32,159
CAN YOU PRETEND
TO KNOW ME

68
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,679
SO I CAN MEET LISA?

69
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,681
YEAH, WHY NOT?

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,856
I SAW HER TONIGHT
AT THE BALLET.

71
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:41,686
SHE KNOCKED ME OUT.

72
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:45,862
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HERE SHE WAS.

73
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,244
HOW SHOULD WE DO IT?

74
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,143
YOU GO BACK TO THE BAR.
WHEN LISA COMES BACK,

75
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,317
STROLL BY AND SAY,
"HI, SUSAN."

76
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,319
ARE YOU A DANCER?

77
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,148
YOU BETTER GO.

78
00:05:56,217 --> 00:06:00,014
SHE'LL BE BACK SOON.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,085
I NEED YOUR NAME.
SHE MIGHT CATCH ON

80
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:02,983
IF I DON'T KNOW
YOUR NAME.

81
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:05,261
SAM CARPENTER.

82
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,505
TELL HER WE MET
ICE-SKATING.

83
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,472
I'LL HANDLE IT.

84
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,927
THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

85
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,687
I GOT NERVOUS.
THERE WERE TWO WOMEN IN THERE

86
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:21,519
PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE
SWEET N LOW UP THEIR NOSES.

87
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:25,454
EVEN IF YOU MARRY FRANK,
WHY GIVE UP PLAYING?

88
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:27,007
SUSAN, HI.

89
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:29,285
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

90
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,252
WHO ARE YOU?

91
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,599
HUH?

92
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,637
SHE'S NOT
GOING TO BUY THIS.

93
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,570
LISA, THIS IS SAM.

94
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,676
HE WANTED
TO MEET YOU.

95
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,403
HE ICE-SKATES
AND EVERYTHING.

96
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,680
THIS IS MUCH BETTER

97
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,164
THAN PRETENDING WE KNOW
EACH OTHER.

98
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:51,203
SHE'S CHARMED BY
THE WHOLE THING.

99
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:52,515
SIT DOWN, SAM.

100
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,897
UH... ARE YOU USING
THIS CHAIR?

101
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:08,082
I KNEW YOU WOULD
HIT IT OFF.

102
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,981
I'VE GOT
AN EARLY REHEARSAL.

103
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,672
YOU'RE A MUSICIAN.

104
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:13,191
TALK TO HER,
NOT ME.

105
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,989
I HAVE AN EARLY
REHEARSAL MYSELF.

106
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:20,854
YOU BOTH WANT
A RIDE HOME?

107
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,683
IT'S OK WITH ME.

108
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,409
SURE.

109
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,515
HERE,
I'LL TAKE THAT.

110
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,792
LEAVE A FAT TIP.

111
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:31,312
WE'RE KNOWN
AS BIG SPENDERS.

112
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,213
MY LIMOUSINE'S
RIGHT OUTSIDE...

113
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,630
THE DOOR.

114
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,170
HAS HE BEEN
WITH YOU LONG?

115
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,068
WHO?

116
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,967
YOUR CHAUFFEUR,
MARIO ANDRETTI.

117
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:07,590
MUST BE HARD
TO KEEP A GOOD ONE.

118
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:11,421
HE KEEPS HIS CAR
IMMACULATE.

119
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,700
IT'S THE BUILDING
RIGHT HERE.

120
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,187
WHY DON'T THESE CABS
HAVE SEAT BELTS?

121
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,154
I'M WEARING ONE.

122
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,193
HATE TO SEE YOU DRIVING
AROUND WITHOUT ONE.

123
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:27,576
I'LL SEE HER INSIDE.

124
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:28,715
THERE'S BEEN
UNPLEASANT THINGS

125
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,579
HAPPENING
TO WOMEN LATELY.

126
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,684
TELL THE DOORMAN.

127
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,893
HE'S BEEN DOING THEM.

128
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,308
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

129
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,172
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

130
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:40,347
I'LL CALL YOU.

131
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,184
GOOD, HE'S ASLEEP.

132
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:51,807
YOU CAN GO NOW.

133
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,981
THANK YOU.

134
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,159
AH, LISTEN.

135
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,712
I'M SORRY.

136
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,196
ABOUT WHAT?

137
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,233
THAT THING
WITH LISA.

138
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:07,167
PLEASE
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

139
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:12,344
DAMN ELEVATOR'S
STUCK AGAIN.

140
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,415
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

141
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,314
CAN YOU REPAIR
AN ELEVATOR?

142
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:17,695
NO.

143
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:21,699
THEN THERE'S NOT MUCH
YOU CAN DO.

144
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,701
WELL,
NICE MEETING YOU.

145
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,703
NICE TO MEET YOU.

146
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,187
GOOD NIGHT.

147
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,982
GOOD NIGHT.

148
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:35,816
THANK YOU.

149
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:36,714
YOU'RE WELCOME.

150
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,198
NIGHT.

151
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,374
WONDERFUL.

152
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,347
YES?

153
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,349
LET ME HELP YOU.

154
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:52,902
I CAN DO IT.

155
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,836
I'D LIKE TO, OK?

156
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,113
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE RAILING

157
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,943
TO HOLD ON TO.

158
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:03,223
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST GOING TO HELP.

159
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,915
THIS IS EASIER.
WHAT FLOOR?

160
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:07,192
37.

161
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,988
I'M JUST KIDDING. 3.

162
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,543
THAT'S NICE PERFUME
YOU'RE WEARING.

163
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,236
IT'S POLO,
BY RALPH LAUREN.

164
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,997
I THOUGHT IT SAID POLIO.
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT.

165
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,209
AM I TOO HEAVY?

166
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,590
NO, YOU'RE FINE.

167
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:30,112
IS THAT WHAT
IT WAS, POLIO?

168
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,217
IT WAS VIRAL
ENCEPHALITIS.

169
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:34,703
PEOPLE THINK
I'M TALKING ABOUT

170
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:37,050
A ROMANIAN
TENNIS PLAYER,

171
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,223
SO I JUST SAY POLIO.

172
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:41,468
IT SAVES A LOT
OF CONFUSION.

173
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:44,195
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.

174
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,720
YOUR METER'S
RUNNING,

175
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,480
AND MY PHONE'S
RINGING.

176
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:54,239
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

177
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,207
WELL... WELL,
GOOD NIGHT.

178
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,002
GOOD NIGHT.

179
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,326
HI, MOM.

180
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,707
IT'S JACK.

181
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:15,640
AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

182
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,711
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.
I WAS JUST COMING IN.

183
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,507
IT'S AFTER 1:00.
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE LATE?

184
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:21,715
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

185
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,544
MY MOTHER WOULD RESENT

186
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,236
YOU MOVING IN
ON HER TERRITORY.

187
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:28,308
THAT WAS MY REASON
FOR CALLING.

188
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:30,241
SHE CALLED EARLIER.

189
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,208
SHE SAID DON'T
FORGET DINNER TOMORROW.

190
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,935
HOW COULD I?

191
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,730
SHE SAID
YOU FORGOT LAST SUNDAY.

192
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,803
LAST SUNDAY
WAS A BAD DAY.

193
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,460
TOMORROW'S
MY DAY OFF.

194
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,532
DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH?

195
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,396
I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING
OF GETTING MARRIED.

196
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,846
I'M NOT AGAINST
MARRIAGE.

197
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,123
I MEANT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

198
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,331
I JUST HAVE TO MEET YOU.

199
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,919
I HAVE THIS MENTAL PICTURE
OF YOU.

200
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:54,506
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M RIGHT.

201
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,025
YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

202
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:59,235
BROWN HAIR, RIGHT?
BIG BROWN EYES.

203
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,721
LAUGH LINES
IN THE CORNER.

204
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,655
I'VE GOT ONE EYE
RIGHT ON MY FOREHEAD.

205
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,623
BUT IT'S BROWN, RIGHT?

206
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:08,728
JACK.

207
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,246
YOU KNOW THAT RESTAURANT

208
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:13,733
YOU ALWAYS EAT AT, 555-3131?

209
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,010
CHARLY'S?

210
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:20,118
I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW
BETWEEN 12:00 AND 1:00.

211
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,499
I'LL BE WEARING
A RED TIE.

212
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,673
I CAN'T MAKE IT
TOMORROW.

213
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,056
GREAT. I WON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE THERE.

214
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,402
GOOD NIGHT, JACK.

215
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,583
WHY DID YOU WANT
TO COME HERE?

216
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,619
THE MOVIE'S
ACROSS TOWN.

217
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,311
I HAD A CRAVING FOR
THEIR TUNA SALAD.

218
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,247
NO PLACE MAKES IT
LIKE THEY DO.

219
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:49,665
SO HOW DID IT GO
WITH SAM?

220
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,736
WE WENT BACK
TO MY PLACE

221
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,428
AND PLAYED KISSY FACE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

222
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:55,982
THEN HE SAID GOOD-BYE
AND LEFT.

223
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,742
MUST BE A CHEST MAN.

224
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,019
WHAT?

225
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:01,056
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.

226
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,127
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S TURNED
OFF JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE--

227
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,612
BUILT LIKE A BOY?

228
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,580
I THINK HE'S
INTERESTED IN YOU.

229
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,719
ME?

230
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,722
HE KEPT ASKING ME
ABOUT YOU.

231
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,723
REALLY?

232
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,001
UH-HUH.

233
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:22,732
THERE GOES
A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG MAN.

234
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,527
WHO?

235
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,565
THEY GUY WITH
THE RED TIE.

236
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,498
WAS HE?

237
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,546
YOU CAN GO
RIGHT IN, MISS.

238
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,101
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO STAND IN LINE.

239
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,274
WHY NOT?

240
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,727
I DON'T MIND.

241
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:54,178
ARE YOU CRAZY?

242
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,731
IT'S THEATER POLICY.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN NOW.

243
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,320
BUT I DON'T
WANT TO.

244
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,220
IF MY BOSS SAW YOU,
I'D BE IN TROUBLE.

245
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,498
COME ON.

246
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,121
WAIT!

247
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,434
SHE CAN'T COME UNLESS
YOU NEED HER ASSISTANCE.

248
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,265
WHAT IF SHE
NEEDS MINE?

249
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,645
BEG PARDON?

250
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,268
SHE'S BLIND.

251
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:19,237
OH, I'M SORRY... I,
I DIDN'T, UH...

252
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,757
CAN I HAVE
YOUR TICKET?

253
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,034
OH.

254
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,072
OH, I'M SORRY.

255
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,625
WHO'S THAT?

256
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:30,559
YOU BUMPED INTO
THE NICE THEATER MAN.

257
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,285
OH, SORRY.

258
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,149
LISTEN, THIS PICTURE
HAS SUBTITLES.

259
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,736
HOW WILL SHE--

260
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:36,427
I'LL READ THEM
TO HER.

261
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,050
WHAT?

262
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:42,882
SHE'S HARD OF HEARING.

263
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:44,400
DOES THIS FILM
HAVE DANCING?

264
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:48,025
I LOVE TO LISTEN
TO DANCING.

265
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:01,901
HELLO.

266
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,281
THIS IS YOUR
ANSWERING SERVICE.

267
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,558
WHERE'S JACK?

268
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,768
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST STARTED TODAY.

269
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:11,738
BIG ED WILL BE BY
AT MIDNIGHT.

270
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,084
WHO?

271
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,741
BIG ED.

272
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,398
BIG ED?

273
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,262
AREN'T YOU BAMBI?

274
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,573
SUSAN BERLANGER.

275
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:23,025
OH! HOLD ON.

276
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,234
SAM CALLED.

277
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,408
SAM?

278
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,237
THIS IS SUSAN,
RIGHT?

279
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,790
YEAH.

280
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,103
THEN SAM CALLED--TWICE.
HE DIDN'T LEAVE A NUMBER.

281
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:35,244
ANYTHING ELSE?
SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR.

282
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:36,590
NO.

283
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:37,764
THANKS.

284
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,572
OH, MY GOD!

285
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,747
GORILLA-GRAM
FOR MISS SUSAN BERLANGER.

286
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,749
THAT'S ME.

287
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:01,029
COME ON IN.

288
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,447
GO AHEAD.

289
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,519
THESE ARE...
THESE ARE FROM JACK.

290
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,659
OH.

291
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:13,420

00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,629

295
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:27,469

296
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:28,573
NO.

297
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,610
IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH.
ONE SECOND.

298
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,751
YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY...

299
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,339
WAIT A SECOND.

300
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:39,964
THANK YOU.

301
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,309
BUT WHY GET MARRIED?

302
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:18,071
WHY NOT?

303
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,107
YOU'RE ONLY TWO WEEKS AWAY

304
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:20,625
FROM YOUR FIRST
RECITAL TOUR.

305
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,213
I'LL PUT IT OFF.

306
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,664
RIGHT.

307
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,493
I MEANT
THE TOUR.

308
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,496
YOU CAN'T PUT OFF
THE TOUR.

309
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,913
MR. SCHNEIDER HAS
WORKED ON IT FOR MONTHS.

310
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:34,398
YOU MAY NEVER
GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

311
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,331
SHE'S RIGHT, SUSAN.

312
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,441
WHO IS
THIS LUCKY MAN?

313
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,960
FRANK BEDHAM.

314
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,479
THE STOCKBROKER?

315
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:50,690
HE WAS HERE
FOR THANKSGIVING.

316
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,002
WE'D BE MOVING
TO TEXAS.

317
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,418
ALL THE WAY
DOWN THERE?

318
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,697
WHAT IF...

319
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,595
WHAT IF THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT?

320
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,638
WHY CAN'T YOU
BE HAPPY FOR ME

321
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,536
AND STOP WORRYING?

322
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:13,230
I'M NOT 12.

323
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,818
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO BUY OIL STOCK.

324
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,889
I REMEMBERED
THAT RIGBY OIL

325
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,308
WAS A GREAT BUY
AT 28 BUCKS A SHARE.

326
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,241
I HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED IT.

327
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:30,488
SHE SAID, "ALL RIGHT, HONEY,
I'LL TAKE HALF."

328
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,697
I SAID, "YOU WANT TO BUY
HALF A SHARE?"

329
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:38,876
SHE SAID, "HELL NO, SUGAR,
HALF THE COMPANY!"

330
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,360
ANYBODY WHO SLINGS
THE B.S. LIKE THAT

331
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,398
WILL DO JUST FINE
IN TEXAS.

332
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,196
FRANK.

333
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:48,679
WHAT?

334
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,233
COME HERE.

335
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,718
YOUR BOSS' FLY
IS OPEN.

336
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,172
YEAH, IT IS.

337
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,518
SHOULDN'T YOU
TELL HIM?

338
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:05,213
ME? LOOK, MAYBE
HE ALREADY KNOWS.

339
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:06,800
HE'S JUST GOTTEN
DIVORCED.

340
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,871
MAYBE HE THINKS
HE'S BEING SEXY.

341
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,356
WHAT IF HE MAKES
ANOTHER TOAST LIKE THAT

342
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,497
AND SOMETHING
POPS OUT?

343
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:22,609
HI, EARL.

344
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,232
I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO
LOSE OUR BOY SOON.

345
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:26,165
SUSAN MIGHT COME,
TOO.

346
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,926
THAT'S A MARVELOUS
IDEA.

347
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:30,479
HAS SHE SAID
YES YET?

348
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:32,447
NO.

349
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:36,209
FRANK, HAND ME
AN HORS D'OEUVRE.

350
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,284
OH, YEAH, SURE.

351
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:45,770
HERE YOU GO.

352
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,771
FRANK!

353
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,808
OH, EARL,
I'M SORRY.

354
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,775
LET ME HELP YOU.

355
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:53,951
THERE WE GO.

356
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,269
EARL IS VERY FOND
OF YOU.

357
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:02,062
IF HE ISN'T,

358
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,790
HE SHOULD BE
AFTER TONIGHT.

359
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,311
THERE'S SOMETHING
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED.

360
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,624
EVERY TIME
I BRING IT UP,

361
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,282
YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

362
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,976
WILL YOU MARRY ME
OR NOT?

363
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:23,291
I JUST WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

364
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,452
BRAVO!

365
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,456
BRAVO!

366
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,976
BRAVO!

367
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,987
THOSE WERE FOR YOU.

368
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:11,649
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU WOULD GO OUT WITH ME.

369
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,582
I DON'T DO THAT.

370
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,963
GO OUT?

371
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,792
I'M NOT INTO THAT.

372
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,312
ARE YOU INTO EATING?

373
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:20,831
OCCASIONALLY.

374
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,972
I WAS THINKING
OF GOING TO CHARLY'S.

375
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,319
IF YOU WERE THERE, TOO,

376
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:28,839
EVEN AT THE SAME TABLE,

377
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:34,154
IT WOULD BE COINCIDENCE,
NOT LIKE GOING OUT.

378
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,846
WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

379
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:38,814
THE EARLY-BIRD SPECIAL.
I WONDER WHAT THAT IS.

380
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,333
WORMS, PROBABLY.

381
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:42,335
I'M HAVING THE LOBSTER.

382
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:44,337
LET'S BOTH HAVE THAT.

383
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:48,376
SHELLFISH MAKES MY FACE
SWELL UP LIKE A BALLOON.

384
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:51,758
I HAD THIS COLLEGE ROOMMATE
WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.

385
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:55,659
HE'D EAT SOMETHING
AND GET ALL PUFFY.

386
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,661
HIS FACE WOULD SWELL UP
LIKE A--

387
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,593
LIKE A BALLOON.

388
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:00,146
RIGHT.

389
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:01,320
I'M GOING TO GO
BEFORE I'M TEMPTED

390
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,183
TO ASK YOU WHAT
YOUR MAJOR IS.

391
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:04,978
WESTERN HISTORY.

392
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,221
WESTERN CIV?

393
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,809
NO, I MEAN WESTERN HISTORY.

394
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,673
THE STUDY OF THE OLD WEST.

395
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,261
YOU CAN'T MAJOR
IN THAT.

396
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,505
YOU CAN AT UTAH STATE.

397
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,955
YOU'RE FROM UTAH?

398
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,992
NO, ACTUALLY,
I JUST WENT TO SCHOOL THERE.

399
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,684
I GREW UP IN VEGAS.

400
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,031
NOBODY
GROWS UP IN VEGAS.

401
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,689
MY DAD WAS
A BLACKJACK DEALER.

402
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:29,693
MY MOM PLAYED THE ORGAN

403
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,971
AT ONE OF THOSE
CHEAP WEDDING CHAPELS.

404
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,765
UH-HUH.

405
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:33,973
THERE'S A STORY

406
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:39,358
THAT MY MOTHER PLAYED
AT HER OWN WEDDING.

407
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,014
SHE PLAYED
HERE COMES THE BRIDE

408
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,983
AND THEN
RACED DOWN THE AISLE.

409
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:53,026
HOW DID IT GO
WITH LISA?

410
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:56,892
WELL...
NOT TOO GREAT.

411
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,687
I MEAN, LIKE YOU...

412
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,620
YOU ORDER PRIME RIB,

413
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:04,279
BUT WANT THE DUCK
SOMEONE ELSE GETS.

414
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:06,005
READY TO ORDER?

415
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:08,007
I'LL HAVE THE DUCK.

416
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,974
ME, TOO.

417
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,520
SORRY.

418
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,315
THAT'S OK.

419
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,082
I CAN TAKE THIS OFF.

420
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:50,394
I'LL TAKE
THISOFF.

421
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,947
YOU WANT ME
TO GO OUT?

422
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:56,331
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO OUT.

423
00:23:57,574 --> 00:23:59,334
IT COMES OFF EASY.

424
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,336
SEE? IT'S OFF.

425
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:02,648
OK.

426
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,040
THIS ISN'T
GOING TO WORK.

427
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:18,629
WHY DON'T WE
JUST FORGET IT?

428
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:20,044
WHY?

429
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,287
IT'S LIKE WHAT
YOU SAID BEFORE--

430
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:24,255
PRIME RIB AND DUCK.

431
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:27,845
BESIDES, I'M
GETTING MARRIED SOON.

432
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:28,501
MARRIED?

433
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,609
YEAH.

434
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,334
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THIS ABOUT?

435
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:37,061
IT WAS A TEST.

436
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,891
EITHER I FLUNKED
OR YOU FLUNKED.

437
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,824
SOMEBODY FLUNKED.

438
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,342
I'M SORRY.

439
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:43,827
UH...

440
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,345
OH.

441
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:46,795
I TRIED CALLING,

442
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:51,351
BUT THE PHONE
WAS BUSY FOR HOURS.

443
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,836
I GOT WORRIED.

444
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,838
SILLY OF ME.

445
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,564
FRANK?

446
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:59,359
THIS IS SAM...
UM...

447
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:00,533
CARPENTER.

448
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:03,018
RIGHT.
THIS IS FRANK...

449
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,813
BEDHAM.

450
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,505
RIGHT.

451
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:11,855
DO YOU LOVE THAT GUY?

452
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,857
I HARDLY KNOW HIM.

453
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,342
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

454
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:17,861
IT JUST SEEMED
LIKE THE RIGHT GUY

455
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,313
AT THE WRONG TIME,
I GUESS.

456
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,074
IT'S OK.

457
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:28,423
HEY, I REALIZE
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

458
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:33,117
THAT WILL HAPPEN
FROM TIME TO TIME.

459
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:35,361
LOOK, THERE ARE
LOTS OF MARRIED COUPLES

460
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,363
THAT HAVE THEIR AFFAIRS,

461
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:40,055
AND IT DOESN'T
REALLY MEAN ANYTHING.

462
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,023
LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP--
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

463
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:43,645
NOT SEX. RIGHT?

464
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:46,855
IF SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
SLEEP WITH SOME GUY--

465
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:47,822
OR YOU DO.

466
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,996
OR I DO--
IT'LL BE OK.

467
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:53,690
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT
THE SAME FELLA, RIGHT?

468
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:01,283
IT SOUNDED LIKE
A GOOD SOLUTION FOR US.

469
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,355
YOU REALLY THINK WE
WOULD HAVE FOOLED ANYONE?

470
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:07,427
YOU KNOW...
IT'S JUST POSSIBLE

471
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,877
THEY'LL ACCEPT YOU
THE WAY YOU ARE

472
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,879
DOWN THERE IN TEXAS.

473
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:11,984
WE'LL FIND OUT

474
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:14,952
WHEN I WALK INTO THE OFFICE
WITH SOME COWBOY

475
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:18,335
AND INTRODUCE HIM
AS MY FIANCE.

476
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,546
I LOVE YOU.

477
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,550
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

478
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,530
I'VE DECIDED TO DO
THAT EUROPEAN TOUR.

479
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,224
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

480
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,019
DID YOU GO OUT
WITH SAM?

481
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:48,365
YEAH.

482
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:51,368
HOW DID THAT GO?

483
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,473
HAPPENS TO
THE BEST OF US.

484
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,578
JUST ONCE,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW

485
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,753
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS
A BAD CONVERSATIONALIST

486
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:58,340
OR BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
LIKE BROWN HAIR

487
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,826
OR I HAD DOGGIE BREATH
OR SOMETHING.

488
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:05,071
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
IMPERFECT PERSON IN THE WORLD.

489
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,386
I USED TO STUFF KLEENEX
IN HERE BEFORE DATES.

490
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:17,359
THEN I'D WORRY ABOUT WHETHER
THE GUY WOULD COP A FEEL.

491
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,878
UNLESS THE GUY WAS DESPERATE
TO BLOW HIS NOSE,

492
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:21,018
I WAS IN TROUBLE.

493
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,540
THIS IS MY STOP.

494
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:30,234
CALL ME AND WE'LL TALK.

495
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,034
PARDON.

496
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,846
BUT, MADEMOISELLE,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

497
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,917
LET ME FINISH
TALKING,

498
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,886
OR I'M GOING
TO CAVE RIGHT IN.

499
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:20,646
THERE'S A HOTEL
IN MEGEVE.

500
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:23,407
I'VE GOT
RESERVATIONS THERE.

501
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,615
I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY

502
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:28,309
TO COVER MYSELF
FOR A WEEK.

503
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,069
THAT'S A SKI RESORT.

504
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:32,727
THAT'S WHY
I PICKED IT.

505
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:34,729
IT'S A GREAT PLACE,
RIGHT?

506
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:37,559
OH, YES,
IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL

507
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,561
BUT I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

508
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,908
IF YOU HELP ME
WITH THIS,

509
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:42,771
I CAN BE LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE THERE.

510
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,014
AND THAT'S WHY THIS WAS
SUCH A GOOD IDEA,

511
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,397
BUT IT'S JUST NOT SOUNDING
SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

512
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:50,572
OK. I'M FINISHED.
YOU CAN TALK NOW.

513
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,575
WELL, THIS IS
NOT VERY... ORTHODOX,

514
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:58,891
WHAT YOU ARE
SUGGESTING.

515
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,894
YOU MAY BE TAKING
A BIG EMOTIONAL RISK.

516
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,690
AS A DOCTOR, I DO NOT
REALLY APPROVE OF THIS.

517
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,900
OK,

518
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,557
THANK YOU.

519
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:11,559
BUT AS A FRENCHMAN,

520
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,906
I MUST
CONGRATULATE YOU

521
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:16,391
ON AN INGENIOUS IDEA.

522
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,842
THEN YOU'LL DO IT?

523
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,914
OF COURSE, WITH PLEASURE.

524
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,571
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO CANCEL

525
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,920
THE AMSTERDAM RECITAL.

526
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:31,579
WELL, UH...
I'M HAVING MY APPENDIX OUT.

527
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:35,928
NO, NO, NO.
I'LL BE FINE.

528
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:36,964
IT'S JUST THAT OBVIOUSLY

529
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:41,140
I'LL HAVE TO CANCEL
AMSTERDAM AND ROME.

530
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,797
NO, DON'T CALL DADDY.
I'LL DO THAT.

531
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,593
I DON'T WANT HIM TO WORRY.

532
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,906
OF COURSE
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

533
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:51,564
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET BACK.

534
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,936
JE PEUX VOUS AIDER, MADEMOISELLE?

535
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,076
NO. I'VE GOT IT.

536
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:26,634
I ALMOST DIDN'T COME
DOWN TO MEET YOU.

537
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:29,326
THE TRAIN WAS LATE
LEAVING PARIS.

538
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:34,849
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO MISS MY TURN.

539
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,403
COULD YOU MOVE IT A BIT
FASTER, PLEASE, MISS?

540
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:41,752

00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,084
BERLANGER.

544
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,090
HOW DO YOU
SPELL THAT?

545
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:09,988
SUSAN BERLANGER.

546
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:12,576
B-E-R-L-A-N-G--

547
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:14,406
SLOWER.

548
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:15,200
BERLANGER.

549
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:18,789
B-E-R-L-A-N-G-E-R.

550
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,481

QUATRE CENTS HUIT.

553
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,591
WOULD YOU MIND
FILLING THIS OUT?

554
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,872
EXCUSE ME.

555
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:36,531
THEY TOLD ME IN PARIS THE RATE
WAS 400 FRANCS A DAY.

556
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,019
THIS SAYS 600 FRANCS.
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

557
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,952
NO. THAT IS
THE LOW-SEASON RATE.

558
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,679
THIS IS
THE HIGH SEASON.

559
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:49,717
THE HIGH SEASON?

560
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:51,443
IF YOU DON'T WANT
THE ROOM--

561
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,445
I WANT THE ROOM.

562
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:56,931
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
NEVER MIND.

563
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:13,120
THERE IS A BIT
OF DIFFICULTY.

564
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:18,021
WHAT KIND OF DIFFICULTY?

565
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,852
THE YOUNG LADY WHO
HAD YOUR ROOM BEFORE

566
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,716
DOES NOT WISH
TO MOVE OUT.

567
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:25,856
SHE HAS TO MOVE OUT.
I HAD THE RESERVATION.

568
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:28,445
IT SAYS RIGHT THERE--
BERLANGER.

569
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:29,722
PLAIN AS DAY.

570
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,829

UHH...
A FRIEND.

574
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:42,494
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM,

575
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:46,946
BUT NOW I HAVE NO PLACE
TO GO.

576
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,776
I CAN'T HELP THAT.

577
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:52,262
IT'S YOUR PROBLEM
IF YOUR AMIISN'T HERE,

578
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:53,850
NOT MINE.

579
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:54,816
CE N'EST PAS
SA FAUTE

580
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,164

582
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:06,138
BON! IF THERE IS
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO,

583
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:08,589
JUST LET ME KNOW.

584
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,456
SO WHEN IS
YOUR FRIEND COMING?

585
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,458
YESTERDAY
HE SAID TODAY.

586
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:20,187
I HAVEN'T HEARD,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

587
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,120
MAYBE HE WAS
ON THE TRAIN.

588
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,124
MAYBE
THAT'S HIM NOW.

589
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,195
ALLO?

590
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:29,920
CHERI... MAIS
QU'EST-CE QUE TU--

591
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:32,647
AH, OUI.EH...

592
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,616
THAT'S OK. I DON'T
UNDERSTAND FRENCH.

593
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,721
I'LL BE IN THERE.

594
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,516
ET QUAND?

595
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,898
TU ES A PARIS?

596
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:45,902
TU VIENS QUAND ALORS?

597
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,869
C'EST GRAVE?

598
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,837
AH, OUI, JE--

599
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,115
TU M'APPELLES? D'ACCORD.

600
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,843
CLAUDE CAN'T COME
UNTIL TOMORROW.

601
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,948
I SEE.

602
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:00,123
HIS WIFE IS ILL.

603
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,470
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

604
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,438
SHE'S ALWAYS
GOT SOMETHING--SIMONE.

605
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:07,406
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS,
JUST THE FLU.

606
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:09,822
BUT HE FEELS GUILTY
ABOUT LEAVING HER.

607
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:11,514
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

608
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:19,004
LISTEN,
THERE ARE TWO BEDS.

609
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:21,558
YOU CAN STAY HERE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

610
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:23,146
YOU MEAN IT?

611
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,492
SURE.

612
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,976
THANK YOU!

613
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:30,774
I WILL PAY MY PART.
I INSIST.

614
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:33,501
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

615
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,814
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOURFRIEND COMES?

616
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:37,367
MY FRIEND?

617
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:40,646
I DON'T HAVE
A FRIEND.

618
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:41,716
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

619
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,167
NOT TO SKI, OBVIOUSLY.

620
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,411
THAT'S--THAT'S RIGHT.

621
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,034
I USED TO SKI...
COMPETITIVELY.

622
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,416
I CAME TO WATCH
THE RACES.

623
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:54,798
ARE YOU FAMOUS?

624
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,457
NO, I'M SUSAN.

625
00:36:58,526 --> 00:36:59,631
NICOLE CHALON.

626
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,149
BERLANGER.

627
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,634
YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

628
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:03,876
IT'S MY FIRST TIME.

629
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:06,085
YOU'LL LOVE IT HERE.

630
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:09,365
COME WITH ME TONIGHT
TO A BIG PARTY.

631
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:12,540
CLAUDE ISN'T HERE,
SO I'LL BRING YOU.

632
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:13,541
TERRIFIC!

633
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,129
ROSSIGNOL IS GIVING IT.

634
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:17,200
WHO'S ROSSIGNOL?

635
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,374
YOU DON'T KNOW
ROSSIGNOL?

636
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,479
THE SKI PEOPLE.

637
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:21,722
OH!

638
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,794
OH... UH...

00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:27,383

640
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,523
TERRIFIC SKIS,

641
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:32,008

BUT TO ME, WHEN A GUY
SOUNDS LIKE THAT,

668
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,255
ALL HE HAS TO SAY IS,
"YOUR PLACE OR MINE."

669
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,672
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DIFFICULT ABOUT IT,

670
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:51,052
LET'S FORGET IT.

671
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,400

WELL, YOU KNOW...

683
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,874
OH, JUST A SECOND.

00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,749
LOOKS LIKE YOU
HURT YOURSELF, TOO.

685
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,751
THIS? NO, NO.

686
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,237
THIS HAPPENED IN AN AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENT YEARS AGO.

687
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:40,930
WHAT ARE YOU
HERE TO DO?

688
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,104
I DO SOME SKIING.

689
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,624
MOSTLY I'M PROMOTING
OUR NEW LINE.

690
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,005
LINE OF WHAT?

691
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:50,215

I USE HIS SKIS.

705
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,419
IF I WIN, IT'S "US."

706
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,731
IF I LOSE,
I'M ON MY OWN.

707
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,733
THE COURSE WAS
ICY AS HELL TODAY.

708
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,494
I ALMOST FELL

709
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:30,393
YOU ARE TOO TENSE.
TRY DANCING.

710
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,913

00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,170
NO, I CAN'T.
I MEAN... DANCE.

718
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,173
BECAUSE YOU'RE GIMPY?

719
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,350

876
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:42,772
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

877
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:46,224

878
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:50,953

879
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,092

AFTER THE MEET?

884
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:03,931

886
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:08,902
YEAH.

887
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:11,249
SO... IF YOU
WOULDN'T MIND.

888
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:12,595
MIND?

889
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:14,977
I'D CONSIDER IT

00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:34,376
I DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY.

896
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:36,895
MAIS C'EST DOMMAGE.

897
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:38,690

00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:41,452
MAIS VOUS POUVEZ PAYER,

899
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:43,902
MEME AVEC UNE CARTE DE CREDIT.

900
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:45,180
WHAT?

901
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:47,906
A CREDIT CARD.

902
00:50:47,975 --> 00:50:50,219
CREDIT CARD.

903
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,823
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALLERGIC TO FUR.

904
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:09,894
WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

905
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:12,276
AREN'T YOU TOO WARM?

906
00:51:12,345 --> 00:51:14,554
NOT REALLY.

907
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:27,592
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
TAKE PICTURES OF SKIERS?

908
00:52:27,661 --> 00:52:30,043
I TAKE PICTURES
OF WHATEVER INTERESTS ME.

909
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,390
OH.

910
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:33,667
BEEN TO THE TOP?

911
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:34,875
NO.

912
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,014
LET'S GO.

913
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,810
ARE YOU EXPECTING
SOMETHING INTERESTING?

914
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:40,916
YOU CAN NEVER TELL.

915
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:59,590
ATTEND!

916
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:01,764
ATTEND!

917
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:09,220
CA VA.

918
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:21,232
OH! BONJOUR, SUSAN.

919
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:23,890
BONJOUR.YOU
GOING SKIING?

920
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:25,754
YES.

921
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:27,238
DO YOU
KNOW PETER?

922
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,032
SURE.

923
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:29,067
HOW YOU DOING?

924
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:31,104
FINE.

925
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:32,450
I HAD
A TERRIFIC TIME

926
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:34,107
AT YOUR PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

927
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:35,936
JUST TERRIFIC.

928
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,767
SO DID I.

929
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:54,679
HOW DID YOU
LOSE IT?

930
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,854
LOSE WHAT?

931
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:03,930
OH, MY GOD!

932
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:06,243
WHERE IS IT?

933
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:10,971
I WAS IN IRAN
ON BUSINESS.

934
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,733
MY CAR RAN OVER
A LAND MINE.

935
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:16,287
I WAS THERE
DURING THE IRAQI WAR.

936
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,013
COMBAT PHOTOGRAPHER?

937
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:19,048
YEP.

938
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:21,913
YOU LIKE THE IDEA
OF DANGER?

939
00:54:21,982 --> 00:54:24,433
NO. I WAS
AVOIDING THE DRAFT.

940
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,452
HOW COULD YOU ASK HIM
ABOUT HIS LEG LIKE THAT?

941
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:44,591
WHY NOT?

942
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,595
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MIND
TALKING ABOUT IT.

943
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:51,667
YOU COULDN'T
KNOW THAT.

944
00:54:51,736 --> 00:54:54,256
DOES YOUR CAST
MAKE YOU AN EXPERT?

945
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,119
MAYBE.

946
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:57,673
OH, YEAH?
WHY IS THAT?

947
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,756
THAT'S WHY.

948
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:24,459
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

949
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:33,502
OH, COME ON, PETER.

950
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:35,953
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
PLEASE DON'T.

951
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:37,679
NO. THIS ISN'T FAIR.

952
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:38,956
REALLY.

953
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:40,337
HELP!

954
00:55:40,406 --> 00:55:42,960
WHAT'S THE FRENCH
WORD FOR HELP?

955
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:46,412
LA H--ELP!
ELPEZ-VOUS!

956
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:48,828
COME ON.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

957
00:55:48,897 --> 00:55:50,899
YOU HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE.

958
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:52,625
YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE!

959
00:55:52,694 --> 00:55:54,765
I'M GOING TO RUN!

960
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:06,224
SLOWLY COMING AT ME,

961
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:08,365
AS IF YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO GET ME!

962
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:09,711
I'M NOT
GOING TO DO IT.

963
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,436
YOU'RE NOT?

964
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:15,751
NO.

965
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,065
YOU'RE LETTING ME
GET AWAY WITH IT?

966
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:20,169
I WANT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

967
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:21,723
WHAT?

968
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,414
OH!

969
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:35,702
AAH!

970
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:43,469
I'LL SEE IF I CAN
FIND US A TABLE.

971
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,927
CAN I BORROW THIS?

972
00:56:55,342 --> 00:56:56,620
THESE, TOO.

973
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:57,690
CERTAINLY--

974
00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:00,278
I WANT TO
AVOID SOMEONE.

975
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:01,866
SUSAN.

976
00:57:03,178 --> 00:57:04,628
SPEAK FRENCH.

977
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:07,182
YOU DON'T
KNOW FRENCH.

978
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:09,184
SUSAN,

979
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:11,255
IS THAT YOU?

980
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:12,532
EARL COOPER.

981
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:13,637
PARDON?

982
00:57:13,706 --> 00:57:15,604
EARL COOPER.
FRANK'S BOSS.

983
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:18,952
YOU WERE
AT THE HOUSE.

984
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:23,267
MAIS NON...
CHAMPS ELYSEES.

985
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:25,269
AH, MY
FRIEND SAYS

986
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:28,065
SHE NEVER
SEES YOU BEFORE.

987
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:30,481
NON PARLER ANGLAIS,
MONSIEUR.

988
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:33,519
VOULEZ-VOUS
FRANCAIS?

989
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,074
SHE SAYS

990
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:39,628
SHE DON'T SPEAK
ENGLISH, MISTER.

991
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:44,219
I, TOO, AM ONLY
SPEAKING LITTLE BITS.

992
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:47,774
SHE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
I KNOW IN AMERICA.

993
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:49,983
IL DIT QUE
VOUS RESEMBLEZ

994
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:52,917
UNE DE SES AMIES.

995
00:57:52,986 --> 00:57:55,920
I SEE THAT
YOU'RE NOT HER.

996
00:57:57,681 --> 00:58:00,304
YOU CERTAINLY
LOOK LIKE HER.

997
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:03,618
SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

998
00:58:03,687 --> 00:58:06,759
PARDON,
MADEMOISELLE.

999
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:10,452
COMMENT ALLEZ-VOUS LE CROISSANT?

1000
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,281
LE CROISSANT?

1001
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,456
WHY ARE YOU
AVOIDING HIM?

1002
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,458
HE COULD RUIN
EVERYTHING.

1003
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:17,528
FRANCOIS!

1004
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,116
OVER HERE!

1005
00:58:19,185 --> 00:58:20,635
RUIN EVERYTHING?

1006
00:58:20,704 --> 00:58:22,637
IT'S A LONG STORY.

1007
00:58:22,706 --> 00:58:24,604
IS HE WATCHING US?

1008
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,157
NO. YOU'RE OK.

1009
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:27,227
MAYBE.

1010
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,298
EXCUSE ME.

1011
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,890
FINALLY!

1012
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:38,273
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

1013
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:39,619
HI, BOBBIE.

1014
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:42,277
I THINK YOU
KNOW EVERYBODY.

1015
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:43,623
FRANCOIS ROSSIGNOL.

1016
00:58:43,692 --> 00:58:45,349
YES, HELLO.

1017
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,178
HELLO.

1018
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:49,042
AND, OF COURSE,
SUSAN.

1019
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:50,388
HOW YOU DOIN'?

1020
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:52,149
YOU ALL SIT DOWN.

1021
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:55,635
I'LL FIND SOMETHING
ELSE TO SIT ON.

1022
00:58:55,704 --> 00:58:57,637
HOW ABOUT THIS?

1023
00:58:57,706 --> 00:59:00,122
DID I DO
SOMETHING?

1024
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,334
DID YOU SEE THE SLALOM?

1025
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:07,267
NO, I DIDN'T.

1026
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:10,650
I WENT UP
TO THE SUMMIT.

1027
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:15,379
I HEARD YOU WERE
LOOKING REALLY GOOD.

1028
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:19,279
I WIPED OUT
ON THE THIRD GATE.

1029
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,867
UNTIL THEN.

1030
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:23,594
THANKS FOR
BEING THERE, PETER.

1031
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:28,185
SHE SEEMS
A LITTLE UPSET.

1032
00:59:28,254 --> 00:59:30,428
YOU SHOULD
GO AFTER HER.

1033
00:59:30,497 --> 00:59:33,190
I GUESS
MAYBE I SHOULD.

1034
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:35,537
EXCUSE ME.

1035
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:48,619
WHY DID YOU
SEND HIM AWAY?

1036
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,621
I DON'T
WANT PROBLEMS.

1037
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,210
YOU WERE
HAVING FUN TOGETHER.

1038
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:54,487
I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN FUN.

1039
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:56,144
I'M INTERESTED IN
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1040
00:59:56,213 --> 00:59:59,388
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO GET INVOLVED.

1041
00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:02,633
WHY ARE YOU AFRAID
OF GETTING INVOLVED?

1042
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:05,325
I'M NOT AFRAID.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.

1043
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:08,639
I DON'T WANT TO
SPOIL MY VACATION.

1044
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,537
BY HAVING FUN.

1045
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,022
RIGHT.

1046
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:16,302
ARE YOU IN THE GRAND PRIX
DES ECLOPES TOMORROW?

1047
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,338
THE WHAT?

1048
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:21,652
WHAT DO
THE AMERICANS CALL IT?

1049
01:00:21,721 --> 01:00:23,550
THE... THE GIMP RACE.

1050
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,104
ALL THE BROKEN LEGS
AND ARMS

1051
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:28,245
GET TOGETHER AND HAVE
THEIR OWN SKI RACE.

1052
01:00:28,314 --> 01:00:29,626
IT'S GREAT FUN.

1053
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:32,145
I DON'T THINK SO.

1054
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:34,631
WHY NOT?
YOU HAVE TO TRY.

1055
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,046
COME ON, SUSAN.

1056
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:38,496
I'LL EVEN LEND YOU
THE RIGHT SKIS AND POLES.

1057
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:42,949
BESIDES, THE WINNER
GETS 3,000 FRANCS.

1058
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:50,957
HI.

1059
01:00:56,722 --> 01:00:59,172
THEY SAY THAT
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

1060
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:02,451
I NEED SOMEONE GOOD

THIS GRANDE
INVALIDS THING,

1062
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:09,251
AND I DON'T WANT TO
LOOK LIKE A JERK.

1063
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,633
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW?

1064
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:14,636
I KNOW THAT
THIS IS SNOW,

1065
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:17,328

1066
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,642

01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:24,542
BUT YOU HAVE
SKIED BEFORE?

1068
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:26,613
WHEN I WAS 7.

1069
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:30,238
I DON'T
HAVE TO WIN.

1070
01:01:30,307 --> 01:01:33,655
I JUST WANT
TO GET BY.

1071
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:35,622
WHEN IS THIS RACE?

1072
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,315
2:00

1073
01:01:38,384 --> 01:01:40,317
SO WE HAVE TIME,
RIGHT?

1074
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:41,663
OK.

1075
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:44,631
YOU FOLLOW ME.

1076
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,640
NO PROBLEM.

1077
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:55,953
WHOA!

1078
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,959
THIS IS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

1079
01:02:09,415 --> 01:02:12,314
TELL ME WHY
I'M DOING THIS.

1080
01:02:12,383 --> 01:02:14,351
I FELL
ALL MORNING.

1081
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:19,114
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO IT, DON'T.

1082
01:02:19,183 --> 01:02:21,323
NO, I'LL DO IT.

1083
01:02:21,392 --> 01:02:23,360
AT LEAST
I'LL TRY.

1084
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:25,638
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE PARTY

1085
01:02:25,707 --> 01:02:27,640
THE OTHER NIGHT?

1086
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:29,435
THE HOST,
ROSSIGNOL?

1087
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,333
YES.

1088
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:33,888
DIDN'T YOU THINK
HE WAS ATTRACTIVE?

1089
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:35,648
I DID.

1090
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:38,651
HE'LL BE
AT THE RACE.

1091
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,204
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1092
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:42,344
I ASKED HIM.

1093
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:44,657
YOU COULD
HAVE FUN TOGETHER.

1094
01:02:44,726 --> 01:02:47,142
HE'S ALONE.

1095
01:02:47,211 --> 01:02:48,834
AND I'M ALONE.

1096
01:02:48,903 --> 01:02:50,352
EXACTLY.

1097
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:01,329
THIS IS
GREAT STUFF.

1098
01:03:01,398 --> 01:03:02,675
THANK YOU.

1099
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:06,575
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
FIND IT INTERESTING.

1100
01:03:06,644 --> 01:03:09,302
SUSAN, GOOD.
YOU ARE DOING IT.

1101
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:11,408
I'M GOING
TO TRY.

1102
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:13,306
HELLO.

1103
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:14,963
HELLO.

1104
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:20,313
NICOLE,
THIS IS PETER.

1105
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:21,383
HI.

1106
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:23,316
YOU REMEMBER
FRANCOIS?

1107
01:03:23,385 --> 01:03:24,662
HELLO AGAIN.

1108
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:26,181
BONJOUR.

1109
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,666
NICOLE OWNS AN ART
GALLERY IN PARIS.

1110
01:03:28,735 --> 01:03:30,979
WHERE DO
YOU LIVE?

1111
01:03:31,048 --> 01:03:32,291
PARIS.

1112
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,362
NO KIDDING.

1113
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:36,502
WELL,
THAT'S GREAT.

1114
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:37,917
I'M GOING TO TRY
THIS THING.

1115
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:40,368
I'LL BE THE PINK
SNOWBALL

1116
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:42,335
ROLLING DOWN
THE MOUNTAIN.

1117
01:03:42,404 --> 01:03:44,821
DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR SKI?

1118
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:45,649
YEAH.

1119
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:47,306
I'LL TAKE IT.

1120
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,308
I'M GOING THAT WAY.

1121
01:03:51,724 --> 01:03:53,657
YOU SEEM NERVOUS.

1122
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:55,659
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

1123
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:58,835
GOING DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN
ON ONE SKI?

1124
01:03:58,904 --> 01:04:00,353
NERVOUS.

1125
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:40,877
OK.

1126
01:04:41,739 --> 01:04:44,363
NOBODY ELSE
HAS MADE IT.

1127
01:04:44,432 --> 01:04:49,678
THANKS
FOR TELLING ME.

1128
01:04:49,747 --> 01:04:50,817
YOU ONLY
HAVE TO FINISH.

1129
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,784
FORGET SPEED.

1130
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:52,681
JUST GET THROUGH IT
AND YOU'VE WON.

1131
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,683
WHO CARES
ABOUT WINNING?

1132
01:04:54,752 --> 01:04:56,685
I WANT TO GET THROUGH IT.

1133
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:57,686
THAT'S WHAT
I JUST SAID.

1134
01:04:57,755 --> 01:04:58,549
I WON'T MAKE IT.

1135
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:01,863
YES, YOU WILL.
GO SLOW.

1136
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:02,691
SLOW?

1137
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,211
AS SLOW
AS YOU WANT.

1138
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,973
IF YOU FALL DOWN,
YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED.

1139
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:14,841
REMEMBER, SLOW.

1140
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:21,848
VOUS-ETES PRETE DE DEPART?

1141
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,265
ATTENTION.

1142
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:25,266
TROIS.

1143
01:05:25,335 --> 01:05:26,267
DEUX.

1144
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:27,268
UN.

1145
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,201
PARTEZ.

1146
01:05:30,616 --> 01:05:32,618
MAIS, MADEMOISELLE,

1147
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:35,000
ALLEZ-Y.

1148
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,385
GO!

1149
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,322
WHOA!

1150
01:05:47,391 --> 01:05:49,048
STOP!

1151
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:55,330
SLOW.

1152
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:56,366
YEAH.

1153
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:18,388
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

1154
01:06:18,457 --> 01:06:20,355
JUST KEEP IT UP.

1155
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:22,012
THAT'S IT.

1156
01:06:24,428 --> 01:06:26,672
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE
SPEED, HUH?

1157
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:29,364
NO, THIS IS
FAST ENOUGH.

1158
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:35,992
OH.

1159
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:42,343
OHH!

1160
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:44,241
HA HA HA!

1161
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,932
SHUT UP!

1162
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:50,282
THANK YOU.

1163
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,873
OH!

1164
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:57,289
OH!

1165
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,051
OH!

1166
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,363
AHH!

1167
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:05,366
I GOT IT!

1168
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:08,921
OH!

1169
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:14,340
AAH!

1170
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:17,067
HEY!

1171
01:07:18,586 --> 01:07:19,863
AAH!

1172
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:25,696
I CAN'T BELIEVE

1173
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:28,699
I SKIED
ALL THE WAY DOWN!

1174
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:30,460
YOU SURE DID.

1175
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:32,703
YOU WERE EXTRAORDINARY.

1176
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:34,705
I WAS SLOW, HUH?

1177
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,914
MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT.

1178
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:38,951
I SHOULD WORK
ON MY TIME.

1179
01:07:40,953 --> 01:07:41,712
BRAVO.

1180
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:43,680
THANK YOU.

1181
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:45,854
HOW ABOUT
SOME PICTURES?

1182
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:47,028
GREAT.

1183
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:50,376
MY FRIEND BACK HOME
WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1184
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:52,965
PETER!

1185
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:56,382
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING PICTURES OF THIS

1186
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:59,385
WHEN THERE'S
A REAL RACE GOING ON?

1187
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:01,629
WHO SAID THIS WASN'T
A REAL RACE?

1188
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:03,527
YEAH, WHO SAID?

1189
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:05,391
AND BESIDES, I WON IT.

1190
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,083
SO GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF HERE

1191
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:09,292
SO I CAN GET
MY PICTURE TAKEN.

1192
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:19,267
SORRY.

1193
01:08:19,336 --> 01:08:21,131
IT'S OK.

1194
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,134
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO AFTER HER.

1195
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,964
I DON'T THINK SO.

1196
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:31,866
WHY DON'T WE
ALL GO UP

1197
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:34,696
AND WATCH THE REST
OF THE RACES?

1198
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:36,560
IT'S THE FINALS.

1199
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:39,287
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT THE CROWDS.

1200
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:41,703
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT CROWDS?

1201
01:08:41,772 --> 01:08:43,774
WHEN I SAID "GO UP,"

1202
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:46,363
I MEANT... GO UP.

1203
01:09:59,436 --> 01:10:02,301
HOW HIGH WILL
THIS THING GO?

1204
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:06,305
WELL, UH... THE ALTITUDE RECORD
IN A BALLOON

1205
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:08,583
IS JUST OVER
53,000 FEET.

1206
01:10:08,652 --> 01:10:10,447
LET'S GO FOR IT!

1207
01:10:10,516 --> 01:10:11,690
YOU'RE JOKING.

1208
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:13,830
THAT'S WITH
OXYGEN TANKS.

1209
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,763
WE DON'T HAVE OXYGEN TANKS.

1210
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:17,834
I WANT TO GO FOR
SOMETHING!

1211
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:21,734
I WANT TO DO THINGS
I'VE NEVER DONE.

1212
01:10:21,803 --> 01:10:23,391
LIKE WHAT?

1213
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,737
I DON'T KNOW.

1214
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:26,774
I HAVEN'T DONE
A LOT.

1215
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:29,708
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO SWITZERLAND?

1216
01:10:29,777 --> 01:10:31,399
NO.
LET'S GO!

1217
01:10:31,468 --> 01:10:33,401
HOW FAR IS IT?

1218
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,231
ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS,

1219
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,991
OVER THAT MOUNTAIN.

1220
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:40,891
WE'VE GOT
TO TRY FOR IT.

1221
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,410
OK.

1222
01:11:15,788 --> 01:11:17,756
I WAS SO SCARED.

1223
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:20,517
I THOUGHT I'D
GET SICK.

1224
01:11:20,586 --> 01:11:22,001
I'VE NEVER DONE

1225
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,727
ANYTHING DANGEROUS
LIKE THIS.

1226
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:25,419
YOU KNOW?

1227
01:11:25,488 --> 01:11:27,421
I FEEL SO...

1228
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:28,905
ALIVE?

1229
01:11:28,974 --> 01:11:30,424
ALIVE.

1230
01:11:30,493 --> 01:11:31,425
HMM.

1231
01:11:31,494 --> 01:11:32,771
YEAH.

1232
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,738
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING.

1233
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:36,809
NO, YOU DON'T.

1234
01:11:48,476 --> 01:11:50,409
THANKS FOR TODAY.

1235
01:11:50,478 --> 01:11:51,686
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1236
01:11:51,755 --> 01:11:54,413
AND TONIGHT. I HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

1237
01:11:54,482 --> 01:11:57,416
I'D INVITE YOU IN,
BUT NICOLE...

1238
01:11:57,485 --> 01:11:58,728
THAT'S OK.

1239
01:11:58,797 --> 01:12:00,350
THAT'S OK.

1240
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:01,938
LOOK, SUSAN...

1241
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:06,252
WHAT I DO TAKES ME
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1242
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,083
I'LL BE HERE A FEW DAYS,

1243
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:11,775
AND THEN NEXT WEEK
IT'S AFRICA,

1244
01:12:11,844 --> 01:12:13,881
AND THEN
MAYBE AUSTRALIA.

1245
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,780
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

1246
01:12:16,849 --> 01:12:19,265
I MOVE AROUND A LOT.

1247
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,993
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
FOR INVOLVEMENTS.

1248
01:12:23,822 --> 01:12:25,755
OH.
NEITHER DO I.

1249
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:28,413
I TRAVEL
A LOT, TOO.

1250
01:12:28,482 --> 01:12:31,485
I NEVER KNOW
WHERE I'LL BE NEXT.

1251
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:34,419
THEN YOU KNOW
HOW IT IS.

1252
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:35,730
YEAH.

1253
01:12:35,799 --> 01:12:38,077
WELL, GREAT.

1254
01:12:39,803 --> 01:12:41,840
GOOD NIGHT.

1255
01:12:42,806 --> 01:12:45,084
GOOD NIGHT.

1256
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:09,661
LA MEME CHOSE.

1257
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:26,781
HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
TO STAND IN THE DARK?

1258
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,783
I WAS JUST THINKING.

1259
01:13:28,852 --> 01:13:30,785
ARE YOU ALONE?

1260
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:33,443
OF COURSE
I AM ALONE.

1261
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:35,790
BECAUSE...

1262
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,793
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

1263
01:13:38,862 --> 01:13:41,140
YOU THOUGHT
MAYBE WHAT?

1264
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:43,902
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU AND FRANCOIS...

1265
01:13:43,971 --> 01:13:46,905
ISN'T HE
A NICE GUY?

1266
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:48,182
YES.

1267
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:51,254
HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE,
INTELLIGENT, AND WITTY.

1268
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:53,083
HE'S GOT EVERYTHING.

1269
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:55,016
EXCEPT TWO LEGS.

1270
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:56,984
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME?

1271
01:13:57,053 --> 01:13:59,435
I DIDN'T THINK
IT MATTERED.

1272
01:13:59,504 --> 01:14:01,022
YOU DIDN'T?

1273
01:14:01,091 --> 01:14:04,578
YOU COULD HAVE SAID
SOMETHING TO ME

1274
01:14:04,647 --> 01:14:06,442
SO I'D BE PREPARED.

1275
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:08,444
PREPARED FOR WHAT?

1276
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:13,794
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS BOTHERS YOU.

1277
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:15,796
IT DOESN'T
BOTHER HIM.

1278
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:19,696
OK. SO IT'S
MY PROBLEM, NOT HIS.

1279
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:22,423
I'M SORRY.

1280
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,461
I GUESS I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU.

1281
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:27,842
UNUSUAL GIRL.

1282
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:30,396
DEFINITELY UNUSUAL.

1283
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,434
THEN WHY ARE
YOU DOWN HERE?

1284
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:35,332
I DON'T
NEED PROBLEMS.

1285
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:36,955
HA!

1286
01:14:37,024 --> 01:14:40,096
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH DEJA VU?

1287
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:41,960
SURE. WHY?

1288
01:14:42,029 --> 01:14:45,619
SUSAN SAID THOSE WORDS
TO ME THE OTHER NIGHT...

1289
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:47,379
ABOUT YOU.

1290
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:49,968
WELL, MAYBE
WE'RE BOTH RIGHT.

1291
01:14:50,037 --> 01:14:52,108
WHO NEEDS PROBLEMS?

1292
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:56,077
OH, CATCH ME!

1293
01:14:56,146 --> 01:14:59,460
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THE NEXT OLYMPICS!

1294
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,461
HEY!

1295
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,704
AAH!

1296
01:15:01,773 --> 01:15:02,946
HA HA!

1297
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:06,018
YOU TWO-LEGGED GUYS
SURE ARE KLUTZY.

1298
01:15:06,087 --> 01:15:11,472
SKIING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
A CONTACT SPORT.

1299
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:14,475
AT LEAST NOT
ON THE SLOPES.

1300
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,201
YOU OK?

1301
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,375
WAIT A MINUTE.

1302
01:15:20,274 --> 01:15:22,621
I HURT MY WRIST.

1303
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,071
OH.

1304
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:29,317
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

1305
01:15:29,386 --> 01:15:32,493
MY LIP HURTS, TOO.

1306
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,394
MMM.

1307
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:38,879
THERE.

1308
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:42,917
IN FACT,
I'M HURTING ALL OVER.

1309
01:15:44,401 --> 01:15:46,369
OH. THAT FEELS
SO GOOD.

1310
01:15:46,438 --> 01:15:48,095
WHAT I LIKE BEST
ABOUT SKIING

1311
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:51,236
IS TAKING OFF
MY BOOTS AFTERWARDS.

1312
01:15:51,305 --> 01:15:55,205
SKI BOOTS CAN BE
BETTER THAN SEX.

1313
01:15:55,274 --> 01:15:57,380
BAD SEX.

1314
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,556
THERE IS A SAYING.

1315
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:02,558
"GOOD SEX IS GREAT.

1316
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:04,560
"BAD SEX IS, UH...

1317
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:06,838
STILL PRETTY GOOD."

1318
01:16:09,288 --> 01:16:10,704
OH!

1319
01:16:10,773 --> 01:16:14,500
WHY DON'T I ASK THE COOK
TO MAKE US SOME FONDUE.

1320
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:18,574
NO. ANOTHER TIME,
THANK YOU.

1321
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:21,784
SUSAN AND I
HAVE TO GO.

1322
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:27,962
THERE'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

1323
01:16:29,274 --> 01:16:31,207
YEAH.

1324
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:33,071
SO, UM...

1325
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,902
WE HAVE ANOTHER
ENGAGEMENT.

1326
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:48,086
THAT WAS MUCH BETTER
THAN FONDUE.

1327
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:52,262
EVEN BETTER THAN
TAKING OFF MY SKI BOOTS.

1328
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,680
WHOO!
YOUR CAST IS COLD.

1329
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:57,613
YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

1330
01:16:57,682 --> 01:17:00,408
"COLD CAST, WARM HEART."

1331
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,551
NOT BAD.

1332
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,070
THANK YOU.

1333
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,418
I WANT TO SEE
UNDER YOUR CAST.

1334
01:17:10,487 --> 01:17:12,248
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!

1335
01:17:12,317 --> 01:17:17,287
IT'S THE ONLY PART OF YOU
I CAN'T SEE.

1336
01:17:17,356 --> 01:17:18,392
SORRY.

1337
01:17:18,461 --> 01:17:20,083
I GOTTA SEE IT. PLEASE?

1338
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:22,707
I'M SAVING IT
FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL.

1339
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:36,341
YOU WHAT?

1340
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,584
I NEVER PLANNED
ON THIS.

1341
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,071
HE WAS THE LAST GUY
IN THE WORLD...

1342
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,073
LISA, WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

1343
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:45,557
TELL HIM!

1344
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,007
I CAN'T DO THAT.

1345
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:51,390
WHAT IF SOMEONE
SPRANG THIS ON YOU?

1346
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,566
THERE ISN'T ANYONE
WHO ISN'T HIDING SOMETHING.

1347
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,568
LISA!
THIS IS MAJOR!

1348
01:17:56,637 --> 01:17:59,847
THIS ISN'T STUFFING
MY BRA WITH KLEENEX.

1349
01:18:03,299 --> 01:18:05,094
WHAT AM I DOING?

1350
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:08,097
I'M LEAVING IN
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

1351
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:11,203
SO WHY TELL HIM
AND RUIN IT?

1352
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:14,103
WHY RUIN
A COUPLE DAYS' HAPPINESS

1353
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:17,244
WHEN IT'S YOUR LIFE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

1354
01:18:17,313 --> 01:18:18,970
YOU LOVE THIS GUY?

1355
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:21,938
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M BOTHERING YOU.

1356
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:26,218
IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

1357
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:28,082
EITHER YOU TELL HIM,

1358
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:31,223
OR YOU MAKE SURE
YOU NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

1359
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:32,569
EVER.

1360
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:34,433
THAT'S WHAT
I FIGURED.

1361
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:36,435
I'M SORRY
I WOKE YOU.

1362
01:18:36,504 --> 01:18:38,886
I GOTTA GO.
BYE.

1363
01:18:54,315 --> 01:18:56,110
CLAUDE CALLED.

1364
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:57,560
OH, HE DID?

1365
01:18:57,629 --> 01:19:00,597
HE WANTS ME
TO COME BACK.

1366
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:03,497
CAN YOU
GIVE ME THAT, PLEASE?

1367
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:15,578
THANK YOU.

1368
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:17,097
WHAT ABOUT FRANCOIS?

1369
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,756
HE DESERVES SOMEBODY
BETTER THAN ME.

1370
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:25,588
LOOK. HE'S
A TERRIFIC MAN.

1371
01:19:25,657 --> 01:19:27,107
I TOLD YOU,

1372
01:19:27,176 --> 01:19:29,626
IT'S MY PROBLEM,
NOT HIS.

1373
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:31,870
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING
YOURSELF, NICOLE.

1374
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:36,841
YOU GIVE ME
TOO MUCH CREDIT.

1375
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:40,430
OUI. CES DEUX LA.

1376
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,399
MERCI.

1377
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:02,314
KISS PETER
GOOD-BYE FOR ME.

1378
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:04,420
I WILL.

1379
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:37,591
HAPPY DAYS.

1380
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,420
RIGHT.

1381
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,600
I'M SORRY,
FRANCOIS.

1382
01:20:46,669 --> 01:20:48,119
ABOUT WHAT?

1383
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:50,259
I JUST FEEL
RESPONSIBLE.

1384
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:51,432
DON'T.

1385
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:53,572
I'VE ADJUSTED.
I'M FINE.

1386
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,264
YOU SURE?

1387
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,610
I'M SURE.

1388
01:20:56,679 --> 01:20:59,613
I HAVE TO LEAVE
IN THE MORNING.

1389
01:20:59,682 --> 01:21:02,581
I'M FLYING TO ZURICH
ON BUSINESS.

1390
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:05,239
IT'S ALL OVER,
ISN'T IT?

1391
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:07,241
YOU'RE GOING.

1392
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:09,209
NICOLE'S GONE.

1393
01:21:09,278 --> 01:21:11,280
PETER IS HERE.

1394
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:13,109
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

1395
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:15,974
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY.

1396
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:18,252
I MEANT HE'S HERE.

1397
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:19,529
RIGHT NOW.

1398
01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:22,912
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE GOLDEN COACH

1399
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:25,673
IS ABOUT TO TURN
INTO A PUMPKIN.

1400
01:21:25,742 --> 01:21:27,020
WHAT?

1401
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:30,851
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE.

1402
01:21:33,336 --> 01:21:36,339
IT SURE LOOKS GRIM
AROUND HERE.

1403
01:21:36,408 --> 01:21:38,134
WHAT'S UP?

1404
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:40,619
I HAVE TO LEAVE
TOMORROW.

1405
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:43,243
LET'S LIVE IT UP
TONIGHT.

1406
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:45,107
THE FOREIGN PRESS
HAVE TAKEN OVER

1407
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:47,109
THIS RESTAURANT
IN ST. GERVAIS.

1408
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:50,112
WE'LL GO DOWN THERE.
WE'LL SHAKE IT UP.

1409
01:21:50,181 --> 01:21:53,253
NICOLE WENT BACK
TO PARIS THIS MORNING.

1410
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:57,464
WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
SO YOU CAN HAVE FUN.

1411
01:21:57,533 --> 01:22:00,294
DON'T LEAVE
ON A DOWN NOTE.

1412
01:22:00,363 --> 01:22:01,606
WHY NOT?

1413
01:22:01,675 --> 01:22:04,643
MAYBE HE WANTS
TO BE DOWN.

1414
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,612
WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE HAPPY?

1415
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:09,614
MAYBE HE
ISN'T HAPPY.

1416
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:11,857
MAYBE I'M NOT,
EITHER!

1417
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:19,072
WHY IS SHE MAD AT ME?

1418
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:23,524
SHE LOST ME WHEN SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT PUMPKINS.

1419
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:28,288
I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU,

1420
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:30,117
BUT I CAN'T.

1421
01:22:30,186 --> 01:22:33,534
WELL, I GUESS
THIS IS, UH...

1422
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:35,364
AU REVOIR.

1423
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:38,470
I EXPECT WE'LL
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

1424
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:40,162
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

1425
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,959
AS FOR YOU...

1426
01:22:51,345 --> 01:22:53,140
FRANCOIS.

1427
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:56,661
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS.

1428
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:01,424
GIVE HER SOME TIME,
AND THEN CALL HER.

1429
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:05,601
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

1430
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,603
IT WOULDN'T
BE FAIR.

1431
01:23:07,672 --> 01:23:09,122
FAIR?

1432
01:23:10,537 --> 01:23:14,610
YOU CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE
BE MORE THAN THEY ARE.

1433
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:17,544
I GUESS
I KNOW THAT.

1434
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:40,670
WHAT'S
THIS THING?

1435
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:43,604
IT'S FOR GETTING
TO ST. GERVAIS.

1436
01:23:43,673 --> 01:23:45,020
LET'S TAKE
A TAXI.

1437
01:23:45,089 --> 01:23:46,642
THEY'RE NOT RUNNING.

1438
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:48,126
GET ON!

1439
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:51,440
IT'LL BE FUN.

1440
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:10,321
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

1441
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,150
IT'S OK.

1442
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:15,981
CAN WE PULL OVER
FOR A MINUTE?

1443
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:24,128
WHAT'S UP?

1444
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:27,303
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

1445
01:24:27,372 --> 01:24:28,615
OH, MY GOD.

1446
01:24:28,684 --> 01:24:30,617
YOU'RE PREGNANT ALREADY.

1447
01:24:30,686 --> 01:24:32,136
NO.

1448
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:35,139
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU BEFORE.

1449
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:38,625
LET'S PLAY NOW.
WE'LL TALK LATER, OK?

1450
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:40,144
PETER!

1451
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,629
I'M NOT
THE PERFECT PERSON

1452
01:24:42,698 --> 01:24:44,631
YOU THINK I AM.

1453
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,150
PERFECT?

1454
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:48,635
YOU'RE SKINNY,
YOU GOT A BUSTED ANKLE--

1455
01:24:48,704 --> 01:24:49,705
IT'S MORE THAN THAT!

1456
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:53,640
I'M TRYING TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING!

1457
01:24:53,709 --> 01:24:55,331
WHAT?

1458
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,471
I'VE GOT THIS...

1459
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,789
THERE'S
A GUY AT HOME.

1460
01:25:05,686 --> 01:25:07,136
AND...

1461
01:25:07,205 --> 01:25:10,312
HE'S ASKED ME
TO MARRY HIM.

1462
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:11,658
I TOLD HIM

1463
01:25:11,727 --> 01:25:14,143
I NEEDED TIME
TO THINK.

1464
01:25:14,212 --> 01:25:16,318
AND WHAT
I'VE DECIDED IS,

1465
01:25:16,387 --> 01:25:18,630
I'M GOING
TO DO IT.

1466
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:20,667
YOU'RE GOING TO...

1467
01:25:20,736 --> 01:25:23,635
YOU MEAN,
ALL THE WHILE WE WERE...

1468
01:25:23,704 --> 01:25:25,327
YOU WERE--

1469
01:25:25,396 --> 01:25:26,983
YEAH.

1470
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,333
WELL, THAT'S...

1471
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:33,162
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

1472
01:25:33,231 --> 01:25:35,682
YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TIME

1473
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:36,821
FOR PERMANENT
RELATIONSHIPS,

1474
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,339
REMEMBER?

1475
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,480
YEAH. RIGHT.

1476
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,451
PETER!

1477
01:25:51,698 --> 01:25:53,320
PETER!

1478
01:25:53,389 --> 01:25:55,978
I WANT
TO GET OFF!

1479
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:01,466
PLEASE STOP, PETER!

1480
01:26:01,535 --> 01:26:03,675
I WANT
TO GET OFF!

1481
01:26:03,744 --> 01:26:05,677
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID!

1482
01:26:05,746 --> 01:26:09,405
IF YOU DON'T STOP,
I'LL JUMP.

1483
01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:10,648
SURE.

1484
01:26:10,717 --> 01:26:12,650
NO, I'M GONNA!

1485
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,479
AAH!

1486
01:26:14,548 --> 01:26:17,689
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

1487
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:20,658
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELF,

1488
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:23,626
DON'T INCLUDE ME
IN YOUR PLANS!

1489
01:26:23,695 --> 01:26:25,456
YOU'RE OUT!

1490
01:26:25,525 --> 01:26:26,974
FINE!

1491
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:29,529
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1492
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:31,358
BACK!

1493
01:26:31,427 --> 01:26:33,740
DON'T BE STUPID.
I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

1494
01:26:33,809 --> 01:26:36,812
I'D LIKE TO
GET THERE ALIVE.

1495
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:38,503
WELL, ALL RIGHT!

1496
01:26:38,572 --> 01:26:40,471
ALL RIGHT!

1497
01:26:56,349 --> 01:26:58,489
OU VOUS ALLEZ?

1498
01:26:59,455 --> 01:27:01,250
GOOD QUESTION.

1499
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:02,976
PARDON?

1500
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:10,328
HELLO, MR. SCHNEIDER?

1501
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:12,157
IT'S SUSAN BERLANGER.

1502
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,333
I'M CALLING BECAUSE
I'M FEELING BETTER.

1503
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:16,990
YOU WHAT?

1504
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,476
THE REVIEWS
FROM PARIS?

1505
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:23,168
I'M SORRY.

1506
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,343
I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

1507
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:27,483
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID--

1508
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,349
THEY DID?
YOU'RE KIDDING!

1509
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:33,178
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

1510
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,699
I REALIZE THAT
AMSTERDAM IS OFF,

1511
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:39,012
BUT WHAT ABOUT ROME?

1512
01:27:40,393 --> 01:27:41,635
CINCINNATI?

1513
01:27:41,704 --> 01:27:43,327
OH, OK.

1514
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:44,673
WELL, WHEN?

1515
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:47,331
IN A COUPLE
OF WEEKS?

1516
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,160
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

1517
01:27:49,229 --> 01:27:51,162
I'LL DEFINITELY
BE THERE.

1518
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:53,509
THANK YOU,
MR. SCHNEIDER.

1519
01:27:53,578 --> 01:27:55,477
BYE-BYE.

1520
01:27:57,755 --> 01:28:00,689
CINCINNATI
INSTEAD OF ROME.

1521
01:28:00,758 --> 01:28:04,382
GOD IS GETTING ME
FOR THIS.

1522
01:30:04,295 --> 01:30:09,196
YOU THINK YOU COULD MOVE IT
A LITTLE FASTER, MISS?

1523
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:13,028
I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN, OK?

1524
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,702
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU.

1525
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:34,221
I'M WONDERING
IF YOU'D BELIEVE

1526
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:38,536
THAT THESE THINGS
ARE THE RAGE IN PARIS.

1527
01:30:42,575 --> 01:30:44,715
OUR TRAIN IS LEAVING.

1528
01:30:44,784 --> 01:30:46,199
I KNOW.

1529
01:30:46,268 --> 01:30:48,270
ALL MY BAGS
ARE ON IT.

1530
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:51,031
MINE, TOO.

1531
01:30:56,312 --> 01:30:59,350
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER ONE
TILL TOMORROW.

1532
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:00,903
I KNOW.

1533
01:31:00,972 --> 01:31:05,701
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND
SOMETHING TO DO UNTIL THEN.

1534
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:08,704
I'M SURE WE CAN
THINK OF SOMETHING.

1535
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:09,878
OH, YEAH?

1536
01:31:09,947 --> 01:31:12,018
YEAH.

1537
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:17,713
THEN WE'LL
GO TO PARIS

1538
01:31:17,782 --> 01:31:21,199
AND SEE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING TO DO THERE.

1539
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:22,649
GREAT. OH, SHIT!

1540
01:31:22,718 --> 01:31:23,995
WHAT?

1541
01:31:24,064 --> 01:31:28,552
I HAVE TO BE IN CINCINNATI
ON TUESDAY FOR A CONCERT.

1542
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:30,726
I'LL GET
MY CAMERAS BACK.

1543
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:31,831
I'LL FIND SOMETHING

1544
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,349
TO PHOTOGRAPH
IN CINCINNATI.

1545
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:34,350
GREAT.

1546
01:31:34,419 --> 01:31:35,800
AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE,

1547
01:31:35,869 --> 01:31:39,632
BE THINKING OF WHAT YOU CAN
TAKE PICTURES OF...
