1
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,416
Number 21.

2
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,688
Number seven.

3
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,756
Number 32.

4
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,496
Number eight.

5
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,400
Number 15.

6
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,704
Number 41.

7
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,273
And number 12.

8
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,875
That's our 15 lucky numbers.

9
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,879
Winners, please bring up
your cards. Losers, there'll
be another game in a minute.

10
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,556
Congratulations, Louise.

11
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,658
Next.

12
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,815
I got the money
from the second grade.

13
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,552
Good work, Charlie.

14
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,221
A nickel bet...
four cents.

15
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,558
The measly allowance
these kids get is hardly
worth the trouble.

16
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,860
Where's the 20 cents
Tommy Perkins owes us?

17
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,930
Doesn't have it yet. He said
his parents will pay him
next time he loses a tooth.

18
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,802
Want me to help him lose it?

19
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,405
Nah. Save the rough stuff
for 50 cents and up.

20
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,743
Eight winners, on a dollar.

21
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,212
Hang on, Harvey.
Let me check my copy.

22
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,386
You've only marked
seven, Harvey.

23
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,421
What are you trying to pull?

24
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:44,057
See? Forty-one's marked
on my card.

25
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,995
I just didn't press hard enough
through the carbon.
That's all. So pay up.

26
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,063
I run a clean game, Harvey.

27
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,766
Take your dollar back and leave.

28
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,570
Look, Cessna,
you can't throw me out of...

29
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,307
Beat it.

30
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,147
Hey, we didn't need
his cooties anyway.

31
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,817
Nene, pass out the cards
for the next game.

32
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,985
Charlie?
Yeah.

33
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,522
Think you can get bets
from the fourth grade too?

34
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:19,627
Sure. I'll tell Mrs. Cooper
I gotta "check" the radiator.

35
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,266
All right, it's keno time again.
Pick your numbers, everybody.

36
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:29,703
Sixty balls in the air, and I grab
the first 15 to pop out the bottle.

37
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,473
Eight out of 15 pays
2-to-1 on a quarter.

38
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,876
Nine out of 15, 3-to-1.
Ten out of 15...

39
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,081
Mr. Ruggles.

40
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,785
So this is where the sixth
grade spends its recess.

41
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,221
You can skin your knees
on the blacktop.

42
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,691
Shut up, Dickie.

43
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:55,195
This is a school, not a...
uh, Turkish bath.

44
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,398
Everyone out.

45
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,918
You snitched!

46
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,688
I'll tell my father.

47
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,957
Forget it, Skip. The house
was losing today anyway.

48
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,435
I just don't understand you,
Dickie.

49
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,405
Why don't you apply
your leadership potential...

50
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:41,274
and all of the energies
which you devote
to running these scams...

51
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,243
to legitimate school activities?

52
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,212
They don't pay as well.

53
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,648
So what's it gonna be?

54
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,451
A note from our parents?
No trips to the zoo?

55
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,654
Oh, no.

56
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,457
I think we are past that stage.

57
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,129
Suspended.

58
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,164
Hey, Ruggles did us a favor.

59
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,601
All they ever teach us is
a bunch of junk we could never
use in business.

60
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,370
I mean, who cares what
the capital of South Dakota is?

61
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:14,074
We always get caught.

62
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,712
Don't start that, Nene.
We always
get caught.

63
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,281
Look, this time
it was just as well.

64
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,052
Charlie was charging us
eight bucks an hour for
protection and collection.

65
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,556
And those second and third
graders were bad credit risks.

66
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,124
We got bigger things
in store for us.

67
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,996
I bet they're right around here.

68
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,065
Hey, wait up.

69
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,341
Come on, Dickie.
You always stop here.

70
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,945
Will you look at this, Nene?
It looks the same way
it did yesterday,

71
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,748
except they put more traps
in the gopher holes.

72
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,385
You know what this means?
A resort right here in Ramona.

73
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,788
It'll mean people'll
be coming here from
all over California...

74
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,890
from all over the country.

75
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:07,294
It's a gold mine, Nene,
right in our own backyard.

76
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,664
You and me have been hustlin'
for nickels and dimes
long enough.

77
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,133
This is our chance to start
making the big bucks.

78
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,436
No way, JosÃ©.
I'm retiring.

79
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,040
I said I'm retiring.

80
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,177
From now on
I'm only selling cookies
for the Camp Fire Girls.

81
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,853
Nene, is that what
you want out of life?

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,090
Cookies? A Kool-Aid stand?
A lousy paper route?

83
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,827
Is that what
it's about for you?
It is for now.

84
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,895
I'm only in the fourth grade!

85
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,931
So you'll waste your time
goofing around
on the playground.

86
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,966
Before you know it,
you'll be in high school.

87
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,401
Then you gotta get good grades
so you can go to college.

88
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,539
Then you gotta get
good grades in college
so you can get a job.

89
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,642
And you know what? You'll be
working for somebody else
making them money.

90
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,977
"Only in the fourth grade."

91
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,446
You better start wising up
before it's too late.

92
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,784
Too late? Dickie,
I'm three years and two weeks
away from my first period.

93
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,887
That's no excuse.
This is the land
of great opportunity.

94
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,157
For kids too!
You think the Declaration
of Independence...

95
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,427
says "life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness"
for grown-ups only?

96
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:20,500
I don't know. We don't study
the Declaration of Independence
till next semester.

97
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,436
If they let me back in.

98
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,906
Okay, be a housewife.

99
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,876
Just don't say
I didn't warn you.

100
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:39,119
We're a little lost.
Do you think you could
help us out?

101
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,288
We'll try, sir.

102
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,258
Do you know where
Oak Tree Lane is?

103
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,194
Sure do...
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,230
You go back the way you came,
turn left at the end
of this road,

105
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,866
then, uh, just keep going
till you see the sign.

106
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:56,804
How far?
Pretty far.
Just keep going south.

107
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,739
I thought it was
in Country Estates.

108
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:02,676
Well, it is, sir, but they
own a second piece of land
just outside Ramona.

109
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,112
I directed a man there
just yesterday.

110
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,147
Okay, thanks.

111
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,883
He was nice enough
to give me a quarter.

112
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,020
Pretty smart for your age,
aren't you?
Thank you very much, sir.

113
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,896
A lousy dime.
Dickie,
you sent them to...

114
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,498
Of course I did.
Those guys are feds.

115
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,802
Come on.
We gotta implement
Condition Red.

116
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,074
That little shit.

117
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,011
Condition Red! Condition Red!
Condition Red!
Condition Red!

118
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,047
Come on!
We gotta go right now!
Come on!

119
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,949
They're coming!

120
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,031
1523.
Oh.

121
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,102
Looks more like a barn
than a castle.

122
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,076
Cessna's too smart to have
anything plush on the outside.

123
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,715
We've come a long way
to nail this clown.

124
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,684
Let's go.

125
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,889
Looks like a converted stable.

126
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,793
Sounds like
it's not converted yet.

127
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,850
Yes?
Mrs. Cessna?

128
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,186
No, I'm her daughter June.

129
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:30,323
My parents are out now.
Can I help you?

130
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,461
I'm Phillip Porzinski.
This is Mel Sloman.

131
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,798
We're with
the Board of Taxation
in San Diego.

132
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,801
San Diego?

133
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,737
Do you know a sailor named Bill?

134
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,339
He said he'd be back from
Thailand in the spring.

135
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,982
I'm Bette Cessna.

136
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,684
You wanna come in and wait
till my folks get home?

137
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:01,588
Uh, no, honey.
I think we've seen enough.

138
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,793
Um... Yes, we will come in
and wait.

139
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,264
Okay.

140
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,200
Come on.

141
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,522
Oh, my God.

142
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,258
Would you like something to eat?

143
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:42,262
We've got oatmeal,
puffed oats
and oat pudding.

144
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,498
Uh, no, thanks, honey.
We've already eaten.

145
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,434
Can we leave?

146
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,840
Um, if you don't mind,
we would like a tour
of your home.

147
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,059
These are all our stalls.

148
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,394
This is Big Red.

149
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,165
Buttercup.

150
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,869
Blackjack.

151
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,211
My little sister, Nene,
and my brother, Dickie.

152
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,549
- Slowpoke.
- Wait a minute.

153
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,920
You kids sleep in here?

154
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,989
Dickie and Nene do.

155
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,824
Me and June have
this one over here.

156
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,461
But I'm gonna get my own stall,

157
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:53,901
when I have my... my...

158
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,403
There, there, June.
It's okay.

159
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,440
That's about it for the tour.

160
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,044
Unless you wanna see
the manure pile.

161
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,748
We've seen enough, sweetheart.

162
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,118
We'll be heading back now.

163
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,453
Y-You kids take care
of yourself.

164
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,324
Mel, don't be in such
a hurry to leave.

165
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,060
- Mr. Porzinski?
- "Por-zhin-ski."

166
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:25,832
"Por-zhin-ski."
Please, look for Bill.

167
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,436
I can't remember
the full name of his ship,

168
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:34,341
but I know the first
three letter are "U-S-S."

169
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,989
I'll do the best I can.

170
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,494
Thank you.

171
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,109
Porzinski, Sloman.

172
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,113
Hello, Mr. Cessna.

173
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,549
What, uh...
What's going on here?

174
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,887
We just wanted to look at your
new surroundings, Mr. Cessna.

175
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,424
Uh, and they were
just leaving, Daddy.

176
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,894
We'll report your circumstances
back to the board.

177
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:33,466
And, uh, just make
payments as you're able
and don't worry.

178
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,584
Yahoo! We did it!
We did it!

179
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,323
Hello, junior!

180
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,558
We did it!

181
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,394
All right.

182
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,397
Just how did this little
masquerade come about?

183
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,679
Whoa.

184
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,620
All right, Dickie.
Come on.

185
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,057
You've suffered enough.

186
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,292
Let's go. One of
the colts got loose.

187
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,653
Dickie.

188
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,093
Now, I don't enjoy
giving you pen duty,
Dickie.

189
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,897
But when you behave
the way you did yesterday,
you don't give me much choice.

190
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:49,536
Getting in trouble at school
and talking your sisters into
tricking government agents.

191
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,972
But, Dad, last week
you said those guys
were a couple of sons...

192
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,110
All right, all right, all right.
Maybe I called 'em a few names
I shouldn't have.

193
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,212
At least in front of you.

194
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,283
But I still intend
to play by the rules.

195
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,518
Now, if I am to lose that case,
heaven forbid,

196
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,854
I'll pay those tax guys
everything they think
I owe them.

197
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,789
That's my responsibility.

198
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,193
Now, you've got
responsibilities too...
to Nene.

199
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,362
She gets 20%.

200
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,131
She also gets suspended
from school, thanks to you.

201
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,933
Sorry about that, Dad.

202
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,836
But I think school's overrated.

203
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,606
You know, we go in there
and study guys like
Ford and Rockefeller...

204
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,176
who dropped out of school
to make millions.

205
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,017
And you always say
"find a way." Well,
I needed some extra money,

206
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,187
and that keno game was perfect.

207
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,055
Not if it breaks
the school rules.

208
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,328
Now, Dickie, you've gotta stop fleecing your
classmates in keno games and numbers rackets.

209
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,697
Start showing 'em
a little respect.

210
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,368
Even Harvey Peterjohn?

211
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,405
Even Harvey Peterjohn.

212
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,679
Now, can I have your promise?
You won't cook up any more schemes at school.

213
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,317
Okay, Dad, I promise.

214
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,853
No more schemes...
at school.

215
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,162
Slicing!

216
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,625
Yow! Dad!

217
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,664
Harvey, I thought I told you
to keep your eye on the ball.
They don't grow on trees.

218
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,032
Brutus thinks it's in here too.

219
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,704
Brutus is probably commenting on your backswing.
 You've lost enough balls today.

220
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:09,576
From now on,
you just caddie.
Come on.

221
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,719
Brutus!

222
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,763
Nene!

223
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,586
- How many balls today?
- Twenty-three.

224
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,456
And one case of pneumonia.

225
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:59,826
I should've stayed retired.

226
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,297
Come on. This is the best deal
I ever offered you...
equal partners.

227
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,699
Equal punishment!

228
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,769
It's in the bag.

229
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,581
Mr. Clark, Richard Cessna
is here to see you.

230
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:25,251
Don't tell me
the riding stable's
screwing up too.

231
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,788
Uh, Richard Cessna Jr.
and his sister Jeannine.

232
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,595
Florence, I've got
a 3,000-acre development
to take care of.

233
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,999
Uh... Just buy a couple
of raffle tickets...

234
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,535
or whatever it is
they're pushing
and get rid of 'em.

235
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:46,406
It's not a raffle.
It's a service.

236
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,041
Hold it!

237
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,346
Just where did you get
all these golf balls?

238
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,215
They were all over, sir.

239
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,751
Golfers are too lazy
to crawl around
after lost balls.

240
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,655
So, uh, me
and my sister here...

241
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:07,093
me and my partner...
are kids,
and we enjoy doing it.

242
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,363
So, uh, well, we know
you need used golf balls
for your driving range,

243
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,232
so we thought
we'd show you how many
we could collect in a week,

244
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,602
and you'd be real impressed
and put us on your payroll.

245
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,238
- Is it a deal?
- Okay, uh, listen.

246
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,874
I already pay
a couple of fellas
to take care of that.

247
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,346
Come on, Harvey.
Get that dog!

248
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:33,185
Well, if it isn't
the suspended Cessnas.

249
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,855
- You wanted to see me, Jim.
- That's right, Orville.

250
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:39,592
There's a mistake on
the new rates you sent me.

251
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,694
Just let me get rid
of these kids.

252
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,730
No, mistake, Jim.
Get him out of here.

253
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,899
There is no mistake.

254
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,902
Orville.

255
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,942
This would be a 50% increase.

256
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,178
My operating expenses
have really mushroomed.

257
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,414
I am sorry, Jim.

258
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,320
These children
better wait outside.

259
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,390
I don't know about
those children,

260
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:16,496
but I encourage Harvey here
to listen to anything that
has to do with my business.

261
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:21,133
Put your fingers in your ears.

262
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,306
Okay, bullshitter!

263
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,109
Why don't you
just put a mask on
and break into my safe?

264
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:34,013
- Look here, Jim.
- You're just trying
to rob me blind!

265
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,717
Just because you're
the only fertilizer company
in this whole goddamn town,

266
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,919
you're not gonna screw me royal!

267
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,088
Understand?

268
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,425
Harvey, what we have here
is a dissatisfied customer.

269
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:51,998
And rather than take his abuse,
we tell him to buy
from a competitor,

270
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,633
if he can find one.

271
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,768
Come along, Son.

272
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:59,205
Dad, look.
It's one of our balls.

273
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,641
I said come along.

274
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:14,887
That mutt pissed on
my putting green!

275
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:20,326
I oughta take that
disgusting dog of yours
and shove him up your ass!

276
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,065
God!

277
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,143
All right.
What was I saying?

278
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,112
I oughta take
that disgusting dog
and shove him up...

279
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,114
I remember.

280
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,018
Take your fingers
out of your ears.

281
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:56,128
I was saying...

282
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,498
I already pay a couple of fellas
to take care of my golf course.

283
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:02,168
That includes
looking for lost balls.

284
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:07,339
So you see, if there aren't
any balls for them to find...

285
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:10,677
they're being paid
for a job they can't do.

286
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,250
In other words,

287
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,987
each ball you have there...

288
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:26,092
is costing me around
20 cents in unearned salary
to my employees.

289
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,929
From now on, you stick
to the school yard.

290
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:33,700
"It's in the bag."
Leave the golf course
alone.

291
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,771
Let's face it, Dickie.
It's a grown-up world.

292
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:42,308
They own everything.
They run everything.

293
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,077
We're just here
to mow the lawns.

294
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,382
Let's go home, Dickie.
We have chores to do.

295
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,219
Nah, you go ahead.

296
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,988
I'll stay and watch 'em
seed the banks for a while.

297
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,039
Nene, look out!

298
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,747
Sorry, kid.

299
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:29,388
Don't worry, Nene.
It's chemical fertilizer.

300
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,638
Dad?
Hello, Son.

301
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:49,141
Yeah, Dad, what does your,
uh, contract with the Country
Estates say about manure?

302
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,312
It says
it's my responsibility
to get rid of it.

303
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,315
Dickie, some joker's been
springing my gopher traps.

304
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:59,786
Well, what if you... what if I...
wanted to keep it?

305
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,488
- Keep what?
- Well, all the manure.

306
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,792
Son, if you're looking for
a hobby, I think you'd be
better off collecting stamps.

307
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:08,360
How many horses
do we take care of?

308
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:14,433
Well, with the riding horses
and the show horses,
thoroughbreds,

309
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,269
I think it comes to 172.

310
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,371
Why?

311
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,575
Too big for just me and Nene.

312
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,713
Dickie, another one
of your schemes?

313
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,515
Oh, no, Dad.
This is legit.

314
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,786
Nene! We're back
in business!

315
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:47,199
All right. I think
we're ready to start out.

316
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,002
Remember, keep your feet
in the stirrups.

317
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,640
Bette, I gotta talk to you.

318
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,309
Dickie, can't you see
I'm busy here?

319
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,579
Oh. Did you tell 'em
about the moose trail?

320
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,582
- Dickie.
- Excuse me. What trail?

321
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,152
We could start you
around that way,
and there's a good chance...

322
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,554
you might see a wild moose
feeding in the woods.

323
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,823
It's only a dollar apiece extra.

324
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:20,432
We will take the moose trail,
thank you.

325
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,036
Look, to be honest,

326
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,839
I really don't think
it's worth the extra dollar.

327
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,809
The moose trail, thank you.

328
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:37,316
- Let Nene do it.
We gotta talk.
- Darn right we do, you creep.

329
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,820
You know what Dad'll do
when he finds out...

330
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,822
you're pulling that
moose trail stunt again?

331
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,191
In times of emergencies,
you gotta take risks.

332
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:49,495
Me and Nene need every buck
we can get for our new business.
We need you to come in with us.

333
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,399
Ha! I haven't recovered
from last summer's losses.

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,469
Hey!

335
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,977
Bette, this isn't some
two-bit keno game.

336
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,679
This is legit,
and we can make a fortune.

337
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,816
They're coming.

338
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,484
You gonna go in with us, Bette?

339
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,888
N-O. No.

340
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,957
Why not?
Because...

341
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,759
I've already got chores
to do each day,

342
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,963
and I wanna devote
the rest of my time
to getting good grades.

343
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,232
Well, now what
kind of talk is that?

344
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:30,502
I wanna be a doctor,
and medical schools
only take the best students.

345
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:34,373
Nitwit, it'll be 20 years
before you can become a doctor.

346
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,343
So what?
So what?

347
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:42,081
You watch the news.
Neutron bombs, nuclear plants,
pollution.

348
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,550
What do you think
the world's gonna be
like in 20 years?

349
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,187
There won't be any air
you can breathe, and you won't
have any gas for your car,

350
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,389
and all your food will be
full of chemicals.

351
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,458
Look, don't wait.

352
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,929
Get the money now while
there's still some stuff
you can spend it on.

353
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:00,032
Nice try, but I think
I'll take my chances.

354
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:03,602
They're coming. Shh!

355
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,010
Look, Bette, now, we can't
do this without you.

356
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,317
Now, I know you've got
this crush on Neil Brody.

357
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,120
- That's a crock of shit.
- Shh!

358
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,425
Hey, it's all
for a good cause.

359
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,761
But if you come in with us,
I promise I can set you up
with Neil.

360
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,065
How? He doesn't
even know I'm alive.

361
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,868
Look, Neil's the editor
of The Daily Bugle, hmm?

362
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:41,440
And what we're gonna do
is gonna be a real story.

363
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,076
When he asks us
for an interview, well...

364
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,614
Dickie.

365
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,284
Understand...
I still don't like...

366
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,155
the childish, two-bit stunts
you've pulled in the past.

367
00:30:56,222 --> 00:31:01,093
This is different.
Count me in.

368
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:07,599
But don't breathe a word
about my diary to anyone,

369
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,635
especially Neil.

370
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,870
Would Macy's tell Gimbels?

371
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,709
Dickie! The head!

372
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,678
Nene, how could
you let me do that?

373
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,214
Me?

374
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,442
Frank.

375
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,513
I thought we were
gonna go to the movies.

376
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,185
I know, Juney,
but I had to buy
some parts for my car.

377
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,389
I'm flat.
Then just pretend
I'm flat too.

378
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,557
Come on, Juney.

379
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:09,795
There's nothing
we'd do at the drive-in
that we can't do right here.

380
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,999
Right?
I don't know.

381
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,268
I wanna go
to the drive-in.
No.

382
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,039
Mmm.
What? Mmm? What?

383
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,141
Let me see. Let me see.

384
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,410
Frank, stop it.
No.

385
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,079
Yes.

386
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,881
- Juney, come on.
- Dickie.

387
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,019
You're never going
to get June to join us.

388
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:36,688
That's what Nene said
about you.

389
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:43,095
Dickie!
Uh, hi, June.
Hi, Frank.

390
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,764
Daddy said you're not
allowed out of your room.

391
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,834
You almost scared
those tourists
back to Tokyo.

392
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,138
Well, I know, June.
But I gotta talk to you
about something important.

393
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,207
It can wait.
No, it can't.

394
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,809
Yes, it can, Dickie.

395
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:01,380
No, it can't, Juney.

396
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:05,417
If you don't out of here,
you little worm...

397
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,653
Listen, wait.
Dickie, come here.

398
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:18,097
Uh, listen, if you decided
it's not so important after all,

399
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,566
it could be worth
a quarter to you.

400
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,471
Really, now.

401
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:29,675
Look, Frank, I've been hearing
June beefing about you
being short of cash.

402
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,911
You know,
and since I've been doing,
you know, okay,

403
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,013
here's 10 bucks.

404
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:38,050
Have a good time at
the drive-in tomorrow night.
Have a little snack.

405
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,619
But tonight you gotta leave
me alone with my big sister.
Geez.

406
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,922
All right?
Is it a deal?
Uh, Dickie, I can't take this.

407
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,858
Frank, do you have
any other way for paying
for tomorrow night?

408
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:50,262
No, but...
Go ahead.

409
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,766
I want to see what
this little rodent is up to.

410
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,369
Whew.

411
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,806
Okay.
See you tomorrow night?

412
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,715
Bye.
Bye, Frank.

413
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,750
Okay, Dickie, what's up?

414
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,819
You've never given away money in your life.

415
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,089
And I ain't startin' now.
Wait till that bum sees
my interest rates.

416
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,024
He's not a bum.

417
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,593
June, he's a teenager.

418
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,997
He's smoking dope.
He ain't got no job.
He ain't got no motivation.

419
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,602
And the only dough he gets
is what his old man gives him,
and he blows that on camshafts.

420
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,240
You wanna wear his ring,
you'll have to buy him
some Cracker Jacks.

421
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,442
Why are you telling me all this?

422
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:46,084
June, you got a lot
of vital needs.

423
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:50,956
New clothes, skin creams,

424
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:56,195
gum, record albums.

425
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,665
Your allowance can't cover it,
and Frank's no help.

426
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:03,169
But if you come in
with us...
Us?

427
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,310
Oh.

428
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,812
We could all become as rich
as Orville Peterjohn.

429
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:17,283
What are you talking about?
Orville Peterjohn's
the richest man in Ramona.

430
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,385
Mm-hmm. And how'd
he get that way?

431
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,853
He's selling fertilizer.

432
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,991
Uh-huh.
And what do we throw away
piles of every day?

433
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,627
Oh.

434
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,134
Dickie, it can't be that simple.

435
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:40,606
That's what they said
about the guy who invented
the Frisbee.

436
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,145
Since we're gonna be
competing with a corporation,

437
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,715
first we gotta be a corporation.

438
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:53,585
Well, that means president
and vice president,
secretary.

439
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,789
I wonder what little big shot
wants to be president, Dickie.

440
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,359
Well, that's one nomination.
Any others?

441
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,095
What are we going to call
our corporation?

442
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:09,368
Well, that's
the next order of business.

443
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:13,104
It should be something
with a real ring to it.
You know, something big.

444
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:18,577
How about...
the Cessna Girls and Dickie?

445
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,680
Wait a minute.
We're running a business here,
not a circus act.

446
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:25,784
I've got it.
I've got it.

447
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,786
The Shovel-uppers!

448
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,159
Don't you get it?

449
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:37,263
We're gonna be shoveling up
the manure.

450
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:40,399
Now, look, we need
something with class.

451
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:43,635
You know, like AT&T, I.B.M.,

452
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,071
ARCO.

453
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,139
Hmm.
Dickie,

454
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,509
I don't know if
we should go that far.

455
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,679
After all, we are just kids.

456
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,090
"Contract.

457
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:09,328
"Official contract between
Kidco, Dickie Cessna,
president,

458
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,963
"and San Diego Country Estates.

459
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,965
"Number One:

460
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:18,370
"San Diego Country Estates
hereby officially
hires Kidco...

461
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,973
to supply it with
homemade fertilizer... T.F."

462
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,242
True or false.

463
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,645
Oh. I see.

464
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,782
All right. "Number two:

465
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,753
"San Diego Country Estates
hereby agrees to pay Kidco...

466
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,459
the cheap sum of four dollars
a cubic yard for
said fertilizer... T.F."

467
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:44,463
Well, that will depend on
the answer to number one.

468
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,499
"Number three:

469
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:51,570
"Said sum will be paid:
A. in advance.

470
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,574
"B. Most in advance,

471
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,943
"some at the end of the month.

472
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,179
"C. Some in advance,
most at the end of the month.

473
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,582
D. None of these."

474
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:08,186
I've been reading contracts
for 35 years.

475
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:10,422
I've never read one
quite like this.

476
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,860
"Number four:

477
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:19,931
"San Diego Country Estates
agrees to: A. Give,
B. Loan, C. Rent...

478
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:24,002
"Kidco a motorized golf cart
for the purpose of...

479
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,807
helping them finish
all deliveries
before their bedtime."

480
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,276
You've got a lot
of them out there.

481
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,880
And I get $10 every time
I rent one.

482
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:40,586
So, I think
I'll circle "C. Rent."
for number four.

483
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,855
"Number five: This contract...

484
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,092
cannot be canceled
unless Kidco screws up."

485
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,895
That's your safety clause.

486
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,863
Well.

487
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,739
I must admit, you sure as hell
show a lot of initiative.

488
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,678
Let's face it.

489
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:09,581
You're just a bunch of kids.

490
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,819
I can't risk it.

491
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,590
Mr. Clark, when you wanted
to build the Country Estates,

492
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:24,162
what if everyone told you,
"You've got a lot of initiative,
but you're just a grown-up"?

493
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:28,033
- That's different.
- Why? We can't help
how old we are.

494
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,302
You need a job done,
and we say we can do it.

495
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,872
And you can't hate us any worse
than you do Mr. Peterjohn.

496
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,342
And we're doing it for you
for a lot less money.

497
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,344
We're just asking you
to give us a chance.

498
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,613
Please.

499
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:51,823
Do you know what a raspberry is?

500
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,880
Hello. Orville?
Jim Clark here.

501
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:19,184
How are you? Listen, Orville,
I've been thinking
about your new prices,

502
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,419
and I've come to a decision.

503
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:25,023
Yeah. Here it is.
Uh, listen carefully.

504
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,848
- Louise.
- Yes, sir.

505
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,951
Something stinks around here,
and I don't like the smell.

506
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:57,122
I want it investigated.
Right away, sir.

507
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:19,010
That's it. Eat...

508
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,629
Whoo!

509
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:08,359
That about cover everything
I owe you, Homer?
Yep.

510
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,896
Looks like thanks to Dickie
I'm becoming your best customer.

511
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,864
Yep.

512
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,971
Nice talking to you.
Yep.

513
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,084
Come in.

514
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,956
It's after 10:00, Son.
Time to put away your homework.

515
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:41,192
I did that a long time ago.
This is Kidco business.

516
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:01,179
I think you know I'm proud
of you and your sisters for
starting your own business,

517
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,049
but, well...

518
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,919
Do you know what
an obsession is?

519
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:10,689
Well, sure.
It's like when a guy
looks up girls' dresses.

520
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,458
Well, yeah, that's
one kind of obsession.

521
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:17,328
But an obsession means
that you get so wrapped up
in one thing...

522
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,131
that you forget
all the other important things
in your life.

523
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:23,201
And I wouldn't want to see
that happen with you and Kidco.

524
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,972
Would you?
No, Pop.

525
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,910
Okay. Kidco can wait
till tomorrow.

526
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,112
Come on. Let me
hear your prayers.

527
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,083
There's never enough
hours in the day.

528
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:44,255
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

529
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:47,558
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

530
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,229
And Nene, Bette and June
can split up my share
of the business.

531
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,834
Good night, Dad.

532
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,241
Sleep tight, Son.

533
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:13,651
Does being in Kidco take up all
of your time on the weekends?
No, not all of it.

534
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:16,788
Dickie and Nene have
the first shift on Saturday.

535
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,624
That means I'm free
every Saturday afternoon.

536
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,827
Neil?

537
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,330
For example,

538
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,467
if someone wanted to take me
to the Saturday matinee at
the Ramona, I'd be able to go.

539
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:32,871
Okay, I guess that'll do it.

540
00:44:32,938 --> 00:44:34,672
We could talk more after school.

541
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,908
No, I think I've got
enough for a story.

542
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,878
You have a nice summer, Bette.

543
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:50,288
Ah, 196 cubic yards of manure...

544
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,258
at four dollars a yard,

545
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:57,195
that's $784.

546
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,968
Pretty good first month.

547
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,236
Wait till Neil sees me
in a permanent!

548
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,372
He'll take me
roller-skating! Whoa!

549
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,141
We're running
a business here. We're
reinvesting this in Kidco.

550
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,111
All of it?
We need more wagons
and shovels.

551
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,814
We gotta establish credit,
and we gotta take out
advertising.

552
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,983
What do we need
advertising for?
Yeah!

553
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:22,387
There happens to be a ton of
flower and vegetable growers
between here and San Diego.

554
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,289
Now come on.
Let's go.

555
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,885
- Who are they?
- Customers.

556
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:57,222
The power of advertising.

557
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:03,361
A balance of $30.
Give her that money.

558
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,635
And thank you, Tiny.
No, thank you,
little lady.

559
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,271
It was worth driving
a few extra miles
to save 30 bucks.

560
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:16,074
- Hey, I'll see you next week?
- Can we make it two weeks?

561
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,880
We have to give
the horses time to do
their best work.

562
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,485
Okay, we'll see you
in two weeks.

563
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,754
- Come on, Mama. Let's go.
- See you later, Tiny.

564
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,857
So long, Tiny.

565
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:43,134
Uh... God, Juney.

566
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:49,941
Frank,
I've been shoveling shit
all afternoon.

567
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,943
I have an English paper
to write for Monday.

568
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,312
I'm too tired.

569
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:58,349
Juney, you haven't been the same
ever since you started working.

570
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:04,923
Frank, if you weren't
always so broke,

571
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,459
I wouldn't have to work.

572
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:15,166
All right, Frank.
A $10 loan, plus
two dollars' interest,

573
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,503
plus 50-cents-a-day
late penalty, uh...

574
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,906
Screw off, Dickie.

575
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:34,319
I think it's time
for a young man...

576
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:38,323
about to enter his teens
to have his own bank account.

577
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:42,894
Harvey, we are going
to start you off...

578
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:47,298
with a brand-new
$10 bill.

579
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,435
Well, this must be
your big day, Harvey.

580
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,905
Yes, sir. A penny saved
is a penny earned.

581
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:56,874
Oh. Here you are.

582
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:59,210
Oh, Mr. Sones,
excuse me.

583
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,980
Jenkins, can't you see that
I'm busy with Mr. Peterjohn...

584
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,449
and, uh,
little Mr. Peterjohn?

585
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:09,120
Yes, I see, sir.
But I thought you'd want
to know about the new account.

586
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,490
You see, sir, they want
to deposit $30,000...

587
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,459
in cash.

588
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,640
Jenkins, get security over here.

589
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,477
Security's taken care of.

590
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:39,050
Dad, that's my account!

591
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,252
Earn your own money.

592
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,222
Uh...

593
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:57,902
So it was a real prosperous
summer for Kidco.
Mm-hmm.

594
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:02,273
As a matter of fact,
we're thinking of getting
into communications.

595
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,276
So if someone wanted
to ask me on a date,

596
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,479
and they just so happened
to be a newspaper man,

597
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:14,185
I could write it off
as a business expense.

598
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:18,089
- Mm-hmm.
- He wouldn't even
have to pay a penny.

599
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,093
Okay, thanks.
Nice talking to you, Bette.

600
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,373
I am losing farmers who've been
buying from me for 20 years.

601
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,475
I don't know
what we can do.

602
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:41,246
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll tell you
one thing I can do.

603
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,382
I can bounce
a bumbling detective
who can't take care of...

604
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,418
four little brats peddling
homemade horseshit.

605
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,654
You are fired!

606
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,560
Harvey!

607
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,595
Yeah?

608
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,564
I want to see you.

609
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,268
But I'm in the bathroom, Dad!

610
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,736
Now.

611
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,980
Harvey!

612
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:20,485
I want you to arrange
something for me.

613
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:33,398
Dickie.

614
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,433
What do you want,
Harvey?
I...

615
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,303
Harvey,
I'm a busy kid.
Oh.

616
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:43,474
Dickie, it's such a hot day.

617
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:48,513
I thought maybe
you'd like to come
to my mansion for a swim.

618
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:56,020
Uh, and bring
your lovely sisters
with you.

619
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:59,124
Well, we've got
a pretty full schedule,

620
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,058
but I think we could
stop in for a minute.

621
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,228
Good.

622
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:10,835
Hamburgers and hot dogs
are being served!

623
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,770
Let's go, kids.

624
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,377
Brutus!

625
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,749
I don't know what's
got into him today.

626
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,617
Normally, he loves children.

627
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,361
You young ladies,
uh, sit over there.

628
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,596
Robert.
Uh, Dickie, sir.

629
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:44,169
Milk shakes. Don't forget
the milk shakes.

630
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,239
This is really swell of you,
Mr. Peterjohn.
My pleasure.

631
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:52,810
As another businessman,
I wanted to help celebrate,
uh, Kidco's success.

632
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,214
We're businesspersons.

633
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,188
As another businessperson,

634
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:07,192
I also have to do something
about that success.

635
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:10,828
You see, you are taking away
my customers.

636
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:20,305
Relax!

637
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:27,178
I have a proposition
that I think is going
to make us all happy.

638
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,084
I want to buy all the fertilizer
you produce every month...

639
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,121
at the price
you charge for it now.

640
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:41,692
You don't lose a penny.
I get back my accounts.
Fair enough, isn't it?

641
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:49,834
Mr. Peterjohn, does that mean
that we'd be working for you?

642
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,769
No.

643
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,240
It doesn't mean
you have to work for me.

644
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,679
I could put Harvey in charge.

645
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:09,954
Sorry, Mr. Peterjohn,
but we work alone.

646
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,790
We don't need any grown-ups
coming in and taking over.

647
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,630
I want you to understand
something, all of you.

648
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,734
To me, you're not just
enterprising kids...

649
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:28,506
To me, you are competition.

650
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:34,211
Well, may
the best corporation win.

651
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,281
We'd better get going now.

652
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:39,484
Come on, girls.
We got a lot of work to do.

653
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,487
Um, bye,
Mr. Peterjohn.

654
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,423
See you in school, Harvey.

655
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:56,401
I bet they don't even write
thank you notes.

656
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:02,573
Those weren't
meant for you.

657
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,176
We got the spelling bee champ,

658
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,379
we got the kid from Annie,

659
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:14,452
and we got the 13-year-old
going to UCLA.

660
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:21,492
But we still need one more.

661
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,763
What about this?

662
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,567
It's from the Sahuarita
Elementary School Bugle.

663
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:33,738
Three sisters and a brother
run a corporation
called Kidco.

664
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,441
They collect horse manure
and sell it as fertilizer.

665
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,523
It's... It's...

666
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:55,426
It's great, but it's not
exactly appetizing, is it?

667
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,668
Executive Secretary Bette Cessna
confided to The Bugle...

668
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:09,039
that this summer Kidco cleared
more than $6,000 a month.

669
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,949
Hmm.

670
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,889
All right, listen. We're gonna
be on television. In a few
minutes, I want you to really...

671
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,191
We got 10 seconds.
I want a big applause, okay?

672
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,827
Let's rub our hands together,
get 'em ready. Get 'em warm.
That's super.

673
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,896
That's great!
You're doing a good job.

674
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:34,365
We haven't got much time.
I want to hear it big and loud.

675
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,702
When I ask for you to respond,
I wanna really hear you.
Five seconds. Get ready.

676
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,405
All right, let's hear you!

677
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:47,478
All right. Okay,
everybody, welcome.

678
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,880
Welcome to Kids "R" Amazing.

679
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,249
We're delighted to have you
here with us. And, listen.

680
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,885
We have four of
the most amazing guests
with us here today.

681
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,287
Would you like
to meet 'em right now?

682
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,392
Yeah!

683
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:04,995
Dad, can't we watch
something else?

684
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:08,766
Shut up, Harvey, or I will
lock you in the basement.

685
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:13,037
All right.
Let's bring 'em on with
a big round of applause, okay?

686
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,375
Kidco, come on, gang.

687
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,579
Hi there.
And who are you?

688
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:24,449
We are Kidco!
All right!

689
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,431
I understand that,
but what is your name?

690
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:43,468
Dickie Cessna,
president and founder.

691
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:46,571
When my research
into Kidco...

692
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,673
uncovered your involvement
with the Cessnas,

693
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,142
I realized you would probably
want to see this program.

694
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,179
I appreciate your
getting in touch with me,
Mr. Peterjohn.

695
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,147
Please. Orville.

696
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,684
Oh, you take care of all
the money. What about you?

697
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,520
Nene, vice president.
Oh, all right.

698
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,890
Kids, come on in and take
your seats. We'll explain
things to our audience.

699
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,858
You see, in order to understand
how Kidco works,

700
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:12,497
we sent our Kids "R" Amazing
camera crew to their hometown
to bring back some film.

701
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,765
Would you like to see
what they brought back?

702
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:17,334
Yeah!

703
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:19,336
All right!
Look right up here.

704
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:23,774
Dickie, Nene, Bette and
June live in this house in Ramona, California,

705
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,777
a small town 40 miles
northeast of San Diego.

706
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:28,946
Their dad,
Richard Cessna Sr.,

707
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:34,451
works at the San Diego
Country Estates where he
takes care of 170 horses...

708
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:38,756
used for trail rides,
horse shows
and thoroughbred racing.

709
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,694
170 horses make
a huge amount of...

710
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,796
you know what.

711
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:48,799
And Kidco mixes it with straw,
let's it compost...

712
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:52,236
and sells it to farmers
and landscapers as fertilizer.

713
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:58,042
All right!

714
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:01,211
That's great! That's marvelous.
Okay, let's get some questions.

715
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,948
Hi there. What's your question?
What are you gonna do
with your money?

716
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,450
All right.
What are you gonna do
with your money?

717
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,653
Well, we were thinking
of a college.

718
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,321
Isn't that great, everybody?

719
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:15,960
They're gonna use their money
to buy the greatest gift in the
world... a college education!

720
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:21,165
No! No, no!

721
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,067
We wanna buy a college!

722
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,736
We don't think they're
teaching the right stuff,

723
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,972
so we wanna take 'em over!

724
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:41,518
I think we've seen enough.
Harvey, turn it off.

725
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,859
And take Brutus out of here
and give him a bath.

726
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,828
But... I...

727
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,165
Mr. Peterjohn...

728
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,036
Orville.

729
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,442
Let me assure you...

730
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:09,714
that I am going to examine
that son of a bitch Cessna...

731
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,983
with a fine-toothed comb.

732
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,252
And when I'm through with him,

733
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:19,289
he's gonna be nailed
on more violations
than have been invented yet.

734
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,698
Actually, Phil, if I were you,

735
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:32,102
Cessna Sr. wouldn't be
the one I'd investigate.

736
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:40,110
"The enclosed letters
and cards...

737
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:43,313
"represent the greatest
viewer response...

739
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,654
Wow!
Whoopee!

740
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,889
Careful with
the return addresses now.

741
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:56,593
These kids took the time
to write to you, you can all
take the time to write back.

742
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:58,729
Listen to this one.

743
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:00,898
"I'm 10 years old and
the newly elected president...

"Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,906
Dickie, could you please
send us an autographed picture
and a lock of your hair?"

747
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,944
I got a marriage proposal!

748
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:17,682
Oh! Nene!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

749
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,618
"Dickie Cessna."

750
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:24,855
"Dickie." Looks like
I'm the people's choice.

751
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:27,224
Well, no wonder,
you little bigmouth.

752
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,695
You hogged
the whole interview.
Yeah, Dickie.

753
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,863
"President
and founder."

754
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,965
I thought we all
found Kidco.

755
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,702
Come on! You two didn't
even want to be in it.

756
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,037
Well, we're in it now,
you creep,

757
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,206
and we work
just as hard as you do.

758
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:45,209
Well, the public's
never wrong, June.

759
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,947
Maybe it's my fiancÃ©!

760
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:52,416
I'll get it.
And you kids take it easy.

761
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,786
Don't worry about me, Dad.
I got two days of reading here.

762
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,926
I'm back.

763
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,462
Hi.

764
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,531
Nice place
you have here, Cessna.

765
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,434
I saw it on TV just last Sunday.

766
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,242
All right,
Porsinski.
Porzinski.

767
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:22,179
All right. My kids
played a prank on you.

768
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:25,449
We really don't live
in a stable.

769
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:29,053
That still doesn't mean
I owe you tax on a sale
made outside California.

770
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,689
When you sold those horses,
they were drinking
out of the river.

771
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:35,059
That means their heads
were in California.

772
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,728
And their legs were
still in Arizona.

773
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:40,297
And four legs are bigger
than one head.

774
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:47,237
Cessna, let's forget
about it... for now.

775
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:48,939
What?

776
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:52,276
We have bigger fish to fry.

777
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:56,213
But the children were
intending to pay income tax.

778
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,149
It's too early for it.

779
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,186
This is sales tax,
Mrs. Cessna.

780
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:05,555
It's supposed to be
collected on every sale
and paid quarterly.

781
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:08,926
And they've
been selling manure
for the past three quarters.

782
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:11,962
They owe the state
six percent sales tax,

783
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:15,800
plus penalties
for late payment,
plus interest.

784
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:18,502
- Penalties?
- Hey, we're just kids!

785
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:24,541
Do you have a sellers' permit?

786
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:29,113
A what?
'Cause if you don't,
that's a misdemeanor.

787
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:32,016
And that means more penalties...

788
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:37,254
and an injunction against
future sales till you get one.

789
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:40,891
For God's sake, Porzinski.
These are children.

790
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:44,028
They're also a corporation,

791
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,864
and they're acting
in violation of state law.

792
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,301
What the hell's this?

793
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,437
A court order...

794
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,372
for all of Kidco's records.

795
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,876
You ain't taking
my Led Zeppelin albums.

796
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,079
This is a different kind
of record, Nene.

797
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,983
Sloman.

798
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,590
Not at all.

799
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:17,094
It was my duty
to alert you tax boys.

800
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:20,430
Those kids were beginning
to give fertilizer a bad name.

801
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:24,534
Okay, Phil.
Talk to you later.

802
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:26,536
Bye now.

803
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,842
Harvey, we live
in a great country,

804
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:35,345
just as long as we know...

805
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:38,548
that the government
is there to serve us.

806
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,820
- You got that?
- Yes, Dad.

807
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,059
Talk of the school yard, huh?

808
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:52,829
Yeah.
Dickie finally got his.

809
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,735
Harvey,

810
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:03,941
you are about to learn
a very important
business principle.

811
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,876
What's that, Dad?

812
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:11,681
When you have your opponent
on the ropes,

813
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:14,451
you don't back off.

814
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,887
You put him out.

815
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:19,723
Yes. In San Diego, please.

816
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,825
Field office,

817
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,194
the California State
Board of Agriculture.

818
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,764
If we break
the cease-and-desist order
in our manure operation,

819
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,367
the Department
of Agriculture says
they'll take us to court.

820
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:33,103
And if we don't pay
penalties by November 1,

821
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,406
the Board of Taxation
says they will too.

822
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:39,243
If we pay 'em
everything we owe 'em,

823
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,946
we're gonna have to
declare bankruptcy.

824
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,482
Do you think we qualify
for food stamps?

825
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:51,555
What do you think
we should do, Dickie?

826
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:58,195
- Dickie?
- I don't know.

827
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,397
Everything's falling apart.

828
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:03,900
The government's after us.
We can't make any money anymore.

829
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:10,941
You were right
a long time ago, Bette.

830
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:14,111
Childish, stupid stunts...
That's all Kidco is!

831
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,381
Dickie.

832
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:21,618
I said that about
the other things you did.

833
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,089
Not Kidco.

834
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:31,695
As a matter of fact,
Kidco's the best thing
I've ever been a part of.

835
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,131
Me too, Dickie.

836
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,867
I liked the keno game better,

837
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,604
but they always caught us.

838
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:44,241
But Kidco's kaput, finished!

839
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:54,251
This contract says:

840
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,487
"Unless Kidco screws up."

841
01:05:57,554 --> 01:06:00,157
It doesn't say anything
about giving up.

842
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,261
I don't think we should.

843
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:10,567
Me neither.

844
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,802
Me neither too.

845
01:06:20,744 --> 01:06:22,646
You're right.

846
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,149
Who do those dumb butts think
they're pushing around?

847
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,927
I don't know what I'd do
without you three.

848
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,064
Is that so?

849
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:46,403
I, uh, guess I got a little
carried away lately.

850
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,307
Yeah.
The TV show
and the letters and all.

851
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:52,376
Do you know what
an obsession is?

852
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:56,080
It's like when you get
so wrapped up in one thing...

853
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:58,982
That you become
a royal pain in the ass.

854
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,618
Yeah.
You could say that.
Yeah.

855
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,089
Well, I'm sorry.

856
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,491
So are we gonna
stick together and fight?

857
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,501
With our last ounce of manure.

858
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:25,109
San Diego District Court,
State of California,
is now in session.

859
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:28,212
The Honorable
Oliver T. Willoughby
presiding.

860
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,314
You may be seated.

861
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,253
The clerk will read
the information.

862
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:43,227
"The People versus
the Corporate Officers
of Kidco, Incorporated."

863
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:46,363
Defendants will please stand
when called.

864
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,865
Richard Cessna Jr.,
President.

865
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:04,814
I'm pleased to see young people
show such an interest...

866
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:07,016
in the judicial process,

867
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,787
but let's remember:
This is a trial,
not a kickball game.

868
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:16,426
The clerk will proceed.

869
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:20,096
Jeannine Cessna, Vice President.

870
01:08:20,164 --> 01:08:22,966
Bette Cessna, Secretary.
Executive Secretary.

871
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,868
June Cessna, Treasurer.

872
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,673
"The defendants
are charged with...

873
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:34,278
"violation of the revenue
and taxation code of
the state of California,

874
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:37,414
"Article 2, Section 6071:

875
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,849
"operating a business
without a sales permit.

876
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:46,756
"Section 7151: failure
to furnish a quarterly
sales tax return...

877
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:50,994
"and violation of the
food and agricultural code
of the state of California.

878
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,565
"Article 2, Section 11702:

879
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,235
"fertilizer production
without pest control.

880
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:00,804
"And Section 12821:

881
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,641
failure to list ingredients
contained in fertilizer."

882
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:09,213
How could we have
done all that and still got
our homework in on time?

883
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,382
The defendants may be seated.

884
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:14,551
And who's representing
the People?

885
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:18,588
George Tuskie, Your Honor,
from the attorney general's
office.

886
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:22,759
Mr. Tuskie. And who's
representing the defendants?

887
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,331
Me and Bette,
Your Honor.
And we object.

888
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,666
He's only representing
some of the people.

889
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,837
A lot of these people
are rootin' for us.

890
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:40,577
We will have order
in this court!

891
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,813
Your Honor,
the prosecution urges
the court...

892
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,417
to overrule the defendants'
intention to serve as counsel.

893
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:50,287
We feel it will render
these proceedings farcical.

894
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,857
I object! What does
"farcical" mean?

895
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:59,396
Will the proposed counsel
for the defense...

896
01:09:59,463 --> 01:10:02,399
approach the bench?

897
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:15,879
It's my duty to warn you
of the possibility...

898
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,983
of negative consequences
of you representing
yourselves.

899
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:24,721
You, uh... You know what
"negative consequences"
means?

900
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:30,827
Could be a bad idea?
That's right.

901
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,796
There's an old saying:

902
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:37,000
"A man who represents
himself in court
has a fool for a client."

903
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,437
No offense, Your Honor,
but if we'd have believed
in old sayings like that,

904
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:42,372
we never would have
made a penny.

905
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:47,010
"Youth is wasted on the young."
"Children should be seen,
but not heard."

906
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,214
They all sound like
they were made up by
some old fart who hated kids.

907
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,450
Now.

908
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:56,353
Be that as it may,

909
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,922
a licensed lawyer
still has the advantage...

910
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:03,493
of seven years of training...
four in college,
three in law school.

911
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,795
Us kids could never
trust anyone...

912
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:09,633
who'd go to school
an extra seven years
on purpose!

913
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,902
Uh...

914
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:20,844
The Supreme Court
has been quite liberal...

915
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,480
on people's rights
to defend themselves...

916
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:27,717
and only requires
that they be literate.

917
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,953
I assume you're both literate.

918
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:36,660
You can read and write?

919
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,330
Your Honor, I know we're kids,

920
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:42,298
but give us a break.

921
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:44,601
All right then.

922
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,836
All the requirements
having been met...

923
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:48,672
Objection, Your Honor.

924
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:51,140
On what grounds, counselor?

925
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,776
It'll be plain silly.

926
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:55,412
I'll risk silliness,
Mr. Tuskie,

927
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,014
to guarantee these defendants
their rights.

928
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:03,219
The court accepts
Richard Cessna Jr.
and Bette Cessna...

929
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:05,822
as cocounsel for the defense.

930
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,824
Hooray!

931
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,470
But it does not accept
this outcries from the gallery.

932
01:12:20,537 --> 01:12:23,807
Bailiff, let's get
these noisemakers
out of here.

933
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:42,826
So, Mr. Grundy, despite
their flagrant violation
of the code,

934
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:47,230
initially you sought
no criminal action against
the officers of Kidco.

935
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,833
That's correct.

936
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:52,168
They are children.

937
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:54,804
But then you changed
your mind.

938
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,908
Last month they resumed
their fertilizer production,

939
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:01,177
uh, still having failed
to obtain a license...

940
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:04,380
or to list the contents
of their fertilizer.

941
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:07,451
They left us no choice.

942
01:13:10,454 --> 01:13:12,889
Thank you, Mr. Grundy.

943
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,858
Your witness.

944
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,965
Uh, we don't want him,
Your Honor.

945
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:29,939
Kidco's records list 345...

946
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:33,176
separate entries
of sale of manure...

947
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,912
since March of this year.

948
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,548
And they paid tax on...

949
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:40,450
None of them.

950
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:47,156
- Thank you, Mr. Pozinski.
- Porzinski.

951
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,761
Your witness.

952
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,734
We don't want him either,
Your Honor.

953
01:14:00,504 --> 01:14:02,872
Mr. Sloman,

954
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,375
were the officers of Kidco
advised that they were
required by law...

955
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:11,447
to obtain a seller's permit
if engaged in the selling
of taxable items?

956
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:18,855
Yes, they were.
They were?

957
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:22,125
And did they obtain
this permit?

958
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,430
No, they didn't.

959
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,966
Thank you, Mr. Sloman.

960
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:34,604
Your witness.

961
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:42,411
Mr. Sloman, some of
my baseball cards are missin',

962
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,516
and Bette thinks you might
have taken 'em by mistake when
you cleaned out Kidco's records.

963
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,052
If you find any,
could you send 'em back, please?

964
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,222
Uh, sure.

965
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:56,960
Uh, could I trade you
the Maris for the Hornsby?

966
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,529
Thank you.

967
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:02,031
No more questions, Your Honor.

968
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:07,737
Your Honor, the State's
witnesses have confirmed...

969
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:10,840
not only the defendants'
violation of the law,

970
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:15,411
but a lack of repentance
bordering on outright defiance.

971
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:18,147
And if these
youthful miscreants...

972
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:21,050
I object!

973
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,520
Transgressors?

974
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:28,224
I still object.

975
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,660
Troublemakers?

976
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:33,229
Okay. We know that one.

977
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:36,866
If these youthful
troublemakers...

978
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:39,468
are not punished
for their actions,

979
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,606
then we will all be guilty...

980
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:45,208
of contributing to flagrant
violation of the law...

981
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,977
by the wide-eyed children
of this nation.

982
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:52,215
Kidco would like to welcome
two distinguished guests...

983
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,117
to this board meeting...

984
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:57,220
who made it pretty clear
that we'd better invite them.

985
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,956
Mom, Dad.

986
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:06,930
Okay.
First order of business: what
are we gonna ask our witnesses?

987
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,200
Dickie, you don't know that yet?

988
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:15,371
Mom, when I had to
give an oral report on
The Last of the Mohicans,

989
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:18,574
I read it the night before,
and I still got a B-plus.

990
01:16:18,642 --> 01:16:22,045
Now, kids, I know we've
been through all this before,

991
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:25,314
but your mother and I
have friends who are
experienced attorneys.

992
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:28,484
They'd be more than happy
to lend you a hand.

993
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:32,121
But, Dad, they ain't kids.

994
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:35,258
Look, we got ourselves
into this, and we're gonna
get ourselves out of it.

995
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,195
We ain't gonna go running
to any grown-ups
to do it for us.

996
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:43,800
That's what Kidco is all about.

997
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:51,474
Don't worry!

998
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,077
We'll think of somethin'.

999
01:19:45,849 --> 01:19:47,884
Dickie!
Hi, Neil.

1000
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:50,753
Have you seen
the San Diego paper?
We're in it?

1001
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,521
In it?
You're on the front page!

1002
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:58,962
They're all out there
to interview you. One of 'em's
from the network news!

1003
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,679
Well, Ollie, it looks like
you're on TV tonight.

1004
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:19,515
I'm already all over
the morning papers.

1005
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:22,451
"All over the morning paper"?

1006
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:27,556
Ollie, you're all over.
That story was picked up
by the wire services.

1007
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:32,929
"Kidco Sells the Manure,
but State Wants Its Own Pile."

1008
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:35,431
Chicago Tribune.

1009
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,537
"Government Sniffs
as Kids Pile Up the Loot."
The New York Times.

1010
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:48,011
"Kids Gelt Smelt."
Jewish Daily Forward.

1011
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,980
You can guess
who the public's
gonna side with.

1012
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,350
I can't help that, Sid.

1013
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:57,386
Tuskie built up a very
strong case yesterday.

1014
01:20:57,453 --> 01:21:01,690
Ollie. I'm not
getting through to you.

1015
01:21:01,757 --> 01:21:04,027
You have to run for reelection,

1016
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:06,462
and nobody's gonna vote
for a mean old man...

1017
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,265
who sends four little kids
up the river.

1018
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:17,573
Sid, aren't you
exaggerating a little?

1019
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,479
Am I?

1020
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:28,551
What happened to the witch...

1021
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:32,055
who tried to stick
Hansel and Gretel
in the oven?

1022
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:45,601
June, stay away
from the cameras.
Why?

1023
01:21:45,668 --> 01:21:49,605
We're supposed to be kids.
Kids ain't got bazongas
like that.

1024
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,046
Mr. Ruggles, how many times...

1025
01:21:57,113 --> 01:22:00,516
did you see me
and defendant Nene
in your office last year?

1026
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:04,453
Well, there was
the football pool,

1027
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,424
the roulette table,
wholesale cafeteria food,

1028
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,494
fire-drill bingo,

1029
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,929
keno,

1030
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:17,000
We Forge Pink Slips,

1031
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:19,135
Rent a Third Grader.

1032
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:25,608
Seven that I recall.

1033
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,978
And how many times
since we started Kidco?

1034
01:22:29,045 --> 01:22:32,115
Well, none, I'm amazed to say.

1035
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,383
No more questions, Your Honor.

1036
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:40,789
Mr. Clark,

1037
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:43,692
you've employed Kidco
for nine months.

1038
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,962
Would you say
we've done a good job?

1039
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,798
Yes. I would.

1040
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:54,237
Your Honor, the prosecution
objects to this whole line
of testimony.

1041
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,273
Whether or not
the officers of Kidco
did a good job,

1042
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,642
whether or not they get in
any less trouble at school,

1043
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,112
these are not the issues
that are being tried here.

1044
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,181
Counsel?

1045
01:23:05,248 --> 01:23:08,217
My cocounsel brother
will handle that objection.

1046
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:17,026
Your Honor?

1047
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:20,196
We see kids
getting in trouble
all the time,

1048
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:22,431
and we see stories
in the papers and on TV...

1049
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,600
about all
the juvenile delinquency.

1050
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,769
Who knows?

1051
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,773
If me and Nene wouldn't have
got into Kidco, we might have
kept up our evil ways...

1052
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,109
and wound up in reform school.

1053
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:35,211
But we went straight,
Your Honor.

1054
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,913
Now we work hard,
stay off the streets,

1055
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,883
and we don't break any windows!

1056
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,918
This big jerk...

1057
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:45,688
Your Honor, I object.

1058
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:49,558
This jerk says if we don't
get punished for what we did,

1059
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,595
it'll encourage other kids
to break the law.

1060
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:55,631
But what did we do?
Well, maybe we're
just kids, Your Honor.

1061
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,766
But instead of
giving us trouble
about taxes,

1062
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,536
the government oughta be glad
we're out working on our own,

1063
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,871
setting a good example
and not stealing any hubcaps.

1064
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:06,909
Your Honor,
what is the point
of this oration?

1065
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:11,347
Your Honor, what is the point
of making kids take a test
they could never pass...

1066
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:14,317
to get a pest control license
they could never get anyway?

1067
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,052
- '- Cause they don't give 'em to kids.
- Your Honor.

1068
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,755
Your Honor, if Kidco's
put out of business...

1069
01:24:19,822 --> 01:24:22,958
on account of licenses
and taxes and crummy laws,

1070
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:25,361
what about all the other kids?

1071
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,963
They'll figure doing a good job
and staying out of trouble...

1072
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,932
will only get you
in worse trouble.

1073
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:33,035
And then they'll
take a lot of drugs
and become a bunch of bums.

1074
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:36,705
And when they grow up,
we're gonna have a nation
full of good-for-nothings.

1075
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:40,676
And I bet some foreign country
will come in and take us over.

1076
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:44,580
Hundreds of years from now,
people will look back and say,

1077
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,550
"The United States
was the greatest place
in the world,

1078
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:50,186
and then they had to
go and bust Kidco."

1079
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:24,953
Order, or the court
will be cleared.

1080
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,591
Your Honor,
you still haven't ruled
on my objection.

1081
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,261
The counsel for defense
will apologize...

1082
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:34,297
to the counsel
for the prosecution...

1083
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,332
for calling him a jerk.

1084
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,667
Your Honor, my prior objection.

1085
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:41,270
The testimony
of the defense's witness...

1086
01:25:41,337 --> 01:25:43,739
and this little diatribe
that we've just heard...

1087
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:46,909
They have no bearing whatsoever
on any of the charges
brought before this court.

1088
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:52,548
I see your point,
Mr. Tuskie. Uh...

1089
01:25:56,252 --> 01:25:59,955
We will, uh, take
an extended noon recess.

1090
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:02,958
And I encourage
the counsel for defense...

1091
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:06,229
to take this time
to develop a line
of questioning...

1092
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:09,097
that will more directly
address the issue...

1093
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,600
of their innocence or guilt.

1094
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,437
- Ooh!
- Mr. Tuskie.

1095
01:26:16,605 --> 01:26:20,309
Right. The kid
shot his mouth off,

1096
01:26:20,376 --> 01:26:22,478
but no harm done.

1097
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,413
In fact...

1098
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:32,221
I'd say if you wanted
to be here for the kill,

1099
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:34,523
it could be this afternoon.

1100
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:40,296
Okay, Orville.
See you soon.

1101
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:48,637
Phil. I assume, uh,

1102
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,940
we're recommending
leniency in this case.

1103
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:54,009
Oh, I don't think so, Mel.

1104
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:57,913
Was that little shit lenient
when he sent us
all the way to Tijuana?

1105
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,915
Aw, come on.

1106
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,388
Mr. Cessna!

1107
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:08,957
Excuse me, please.

1108
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,830
Neil, there must be
a hundred kids out there.

1109
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,200
I'd do it myself,
but I'm kinda busy today.
Dickie!

1110
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:21,136
I'm a journalist
covering a trial.

1111
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:23,439
Who's gonna believe
I'm objective...

1112
01:27:23,506 --> 01:27:25,941
if I start selling
these Kidco T-shirts?

1113
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:29,645
Look, it's
five dollars a shirt,
including the sales tax.

1114
01:27:29,712 --> 01:27:32,581
And we'll give you
20% commission.

1115
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:36,285
I could always say
I was working undercover.

1116
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,727
- Can I get an interview?
- Juney!

1117
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:50,733
Frank.

1118
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:56,305
I had to be with you, Juney.

1119
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:58,273
Forget what I said about Kidco.

1120
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,409
I love you.

1121
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:02,645
What about
all the money
you owe me, pal?

1122
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:05,581
You know we're in
triple figures by now?

1123
01:28:08,351 --> 01:28:10,386
I think I'll go help Neil.

1124
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:12,488
Bette!
Aw, let her go, Dad.

1125
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:14,623
We're all done here.

1126
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,225
All done?
What about your defense?

1127
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,996
Nothing more we can do.
Mr. Woodward said he'd get
here as soon as he could.

1128
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:26,034
Woodward?

1129
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:48,023
All right. Counsel for the defense.

1130
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:51,494
The court trusts you heeded
its advice during the recess.

1131
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,631
We've got no worries,
okay?
Counsel.

1132
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:58,200
- Woodward will be here.
- Counsel?

1133
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:02,938
Yeah, Your Honor,
but, uh, we might need
a little more time.

1134
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:09,011
He's here.

1135
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:19,321
The defense calls
Mr. Homer Woodward
to the stand.

1136
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:21,323
Is Homer Woodward
in the courtroom?

1137
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:24,460
Yep.
Take the stand, please.

1138
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:40,108
Do you swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1139
01:29:40,175 --> 01:29:42,010
Yep.
Be seated.

1140
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,489
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Woodward.

1141
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:56,925
Could you please tell everyone
if you own Woodward's Feed Store
in Ramona?

1142
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,827
Yep.

1143
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:03,432
And does my dad buy hay, oats
and straw from your store?
Yep.

1144
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:08,036
And does my dad pay sales tax on
everything he buys from you?
Yep.

1145
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:11,840
Your Honor,
the prosecution has not accused
the defendants' father...

1146
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:14,977
of not paying sales tax
on horse feed.

1147
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:16,945
Good,

1148
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:21,850
because all Kidco sells is
straw composted with manure,

1149
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,087
which used to be hay and oats.

1150
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:27,490
Your Honor,

1151
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:30,225
well, even us kids know
that if your dad pays tax...

1152
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,895
on the stuff going
into the horse,

1153
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:36,999
we shouldn't have to pay
more tax on the same stuff
comin' back out.

1154
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,968
I mean,
we're getting taxed
at both ends.

1155
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:47,476
George! George.

1156
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,590
Order, order! Order!

1157
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:11,399
Mr. Tuskie, the defense
does make a strong argument...

1158
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:14,269
that tax has already
been collected...

1159
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:16,371
on the item they're selling.

1160
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:18,774
Surely our state agencies...

1161
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:22,177
don't seek to tax
the same item twice.

1162
01:31:22,244 --> 01:31:26,181
Your Honor, the prosecution
wishes a moment to confer.

1163
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,519
Uh...

1164
01:31:31,787 --> 01:31:34,356
George, I'm gonna nail
that little slimy...

1165
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,692
Forget it, forget it.
Quiet, Mel.

1166
01:31:36,759 --> 01:31:38,661
You don't have a case.

1167
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,236
Your Honor?

1168
01:31:48,303 --> 01:31:51,339
Your Honor!

1169
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:54,076
On behalf of
the Board of Taxation,

1170
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:56,178
we made a mistake.

1171
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,087
What good is spending...

1172
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:07,990
What did you do?
Forget it.
It's over. Let's go.

1173
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:11,526
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.

1174
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,832
The Board of Taxation
acknowledges its error.

1175
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:20,168
The charges against Kidco
are dismissed!

1176
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:27,042
The charges are dismissed
against Kidco.

1177
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:29,712
Dismissed!
Yes, yes, yes!
Dismissed.

1178
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,694
Your Honor. Your Honor!

1179
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:47,696
Your Honor. Your Honor!

1180
01:32:47,763 --> 01:32:50,799
Your Honor.
Mr. Tuskie.

1181
01:32:50,866 --> 01:32:54,502
Your Honor, the charges
that the officers of Kidco...

1182
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,205
failed to obtain a license...

1183
01:32:57,272 --> 01:32:59,675
and to reveal the contents
of their fertilizer...

1184
01:32:59,742 --> 01:33:02,244
still remain before this court.

1185
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:04,980
Bummer.

1186
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:12,020
George, there must be some
compromise we could work out.

1187
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,457
Mr. Grundy has said
that he doesn't want
his department...

1188
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,525
to appear too heartless.

1189
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,496
So then he might be willing
to grant a special permit
to Kidco...

1190
01:33:21,563 --> 01:33:24,266
till the officers come of age.

1191
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:30,072
Of course, the prosecution
would expect a little something
in return for these concessions.

1192
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:32,808
Well, what do you have
in mind, George?

1193
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:39,581
A guilty plea
on both remaining counts,

1194
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:42,785
with the court's assurance
that they'll be fined
for each offense.

1195
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:48,290
Judge, Grundy doesn't want
to be embarrassed by this case
any more than you do.

1196
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:52,861
But the State's not
coming away empty-handed.

1197
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:57,399
Would, uh, Kidco be willing
to accept this compromise?

1198
01:33:59,534 --> 01:34:02,137
Well, I don't know, Judge.

1199
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:05,307
We'd better talk it over
with Nene and June first.

1200
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:09,912
I understand.

1201
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:13,081
You have until tomorrow morning
to give me your answer.

1202
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:23,926
So, when we're done
paying the fine,

1203
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:27,062
we have a balance of $38.

1204
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:33,401
But from now on,
you'll be protected.

1205
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:37,773
You'll have the State
off your back.

1206
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,177
Mom, we didn't work that hard
and make all that money
just to lose it.

1207
01:34:42,244 --> 01:34:45,313
We know that, Son.

1208
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,150
It's after 7:00!

1209
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:50,352
Nene.

1210
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:52,955
Do you have to watch
The People's Court
tonight?

1211
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,991
Bette, the network news is on.
Our interview!

1212
01:34:58,226 --> 01:35:00,729
The outcome
has not yet been determined.
This is it!

1213
01:35:00,796 --> 01:35:04,532
We now switch you
to Maggie Alexander at
the Ramona County Courthouse.

1214
01:35:04,599 --> 01:35:08,070
People are always telling kids
to get off their butts
and do some work.

1215
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:11,907
Well, us kids did.
Then we got busted for it.

1216
01:35:11,974 --> 01:35:15,043
And if we let 'em do it to us,
the paperboys will be next.

1217
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,613
So you feel
that you're fighting for other
children as well as yourselves?

1218
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:23,185
That's right!
We got a lot of letters
when we went on TV before.

1219
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:27,055
And we'd only wish
that all those kids
could come here to San Diego...

1220
01:35:27,122 --> 01:35:30,125
to show those bureaucrats
that they can't push
us kids around.

1221
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,297
Hey.

1222
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:42,304
It has been brought to
the court's attention...

1223
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:45,908
that the defendants
want to change their pleas...

1224
01:35:45,974 --> 01:35:48,143
to the remaining charges.

1225
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:51,847
Before those pleas are entered,
I wish to commend...

1226
01:35:51,914 --> 01:35:55,117
the California State
Board of Agriculture...

1227
01:35:55,183 --> 01:35:58,854
for its intention
to make special allowances...

1228
01:35:58,921 --> 01:36:02,791
that will enable Kidco
to resume...

1229
01:36:02,858 --> 01:36:05,160
its fertilizer production.

1230
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:16,839
However, this court
must still rule...

1231
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:21,810
on the conduct
of Kidco's officers
in the past.

1232
01:36:21,877 --> 01:36:25,413
And so, albeit
with great sympathy,

1233
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,083
I will hear their new plea
to charges...

1234
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,285
of violating the code...

1235
01:36:30,352 --> 01:36:34,322
of the California State
Board of Agriculture.

1236
01:36:34,389 --> 01:36:37,359
The defendants will rise.

1237
01:36:42,164 --> 01:36:45,567
June Cessna, how do you plead?

1238
01:36:47,169 --> 01:36:50,005
Guilty.

1239
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:53,108
Bette Cessna, how do you plead?

1240
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:56,311
Guilty.

1241
01:36:56,378 --> 01:37:00,115
Richard Cessna Jr.,
how do you plead?

1242
01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:03,185
Guilty.

1243
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:06,821
Jeannine Cessna,
how do you plead?

1244
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:11,193
Guilty, but it stinks!

1245
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:14,362
The court accepts these pleas...

1246
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:18,833
and, in accordance with the laws
of the state of California,

1247
01:37:18,901 --> 01:37:21,669
fines the defendants
the sum of no more than...

1248
01:37:21,736 --> 01:37:25,373
but no less than the total
of their illegal earnings...

1249
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,376
from fertilizer sales to date.

1250
01:37:30,212 --> 01:37:34,416
Rough morning.
I think they should have
some time alone now.

1251
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:37,819
Excuse me, Mr. Cessna.
We'd appreciate you
not going outside.

1252
01:37:37,886 --> 01:37:40,255
It could start a riot.

1253
01:37:40,322 --> 01:37:42,925
What?
Kidco! Kidco!

1254
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:50,132
What are they shouting?
What are they shouting?

1255
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,234
- Hey!
- Wait!

1256
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,140
Get out of the way, kids.
I'm trying to get
to my car, please.

1257
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:01,176
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1258
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:05,247
Kidco! Kidco!
Harvey, I thought I told you
not to come here today.

1259
01:38:05,313 --> 01:38:08,483
I didn't want to be
the only kid in school.

1260
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:11,619
Bye, Dad!

1261
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:58,100
Kidco! Kidco! Kidco!

1262
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:03,071
Neil!
What are those?

1263
01:39:03,138 --> 01:39:06,074
Orders for Kidco
T-shirts.

1264
01:39:06,141 --> 01:39:10,245
- How many did you get?
- How many kids are out there?

1265
01:39:10,312 --> 01:39:13,581
They're not gonna disperse
unless you say something
to them.

1266
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:16,851
Go ahead.

1267
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:20,388
Come on.
Okay.

1268
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:22,324
Neil!

1269
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,335
Kidco! Kidco! Kidco!

1270
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:58,293
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello!

1271
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,663
My sisters and me
want to thank you all
for showing up today.

1272
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:05,633
And we just wanna tell you
that you just made us enough
money to pay our fine.

1273
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:10,238
Maybe now those bureaucrats
will pick on someone
their own size!

1274
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:32,994
I also want to take
this opportunity...

1275
01:40:33,061 --> 01:40:36,598
to announce plans
for a new Kidco poster.

1276
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:48,676
Not only our name on it,
but a picture of our president,
so come and get your orders in!

1277
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,882
Kidco! Kidco!

1278
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:57,152
Kidco! Kidco!

1279
01:40:57,219 --> 01:40:59,221
Kidco! Kidco!

1280
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:02,890
Kidco! Kidco!
Kidco! Kidco!

1281
01:41:02,957 --> 01:41:05,793
Kidco! Kidco!

1282
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:09,331
Kidco! Kidco!
Kidco! Kidco!

1283
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:13,268
Kidco! Kidco!
Kidco! Kidco!

1284
01:41:13,335 --> 01:41:17,672
Kidco! Kidco!
Kidco! Kidco!
