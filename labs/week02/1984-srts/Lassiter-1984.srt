00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:33,733
Lassiter

3
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,999
London June 1939

4
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,781
I think you've had enough.

5
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,876
I'm not interested 
in what you think.


6
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,779
No there is no interessado 
that ningum Acha


7
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,226
including our friends.

8
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:26,556
I gave you a lot

9
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,312
expected better behavior.

10
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,187
The wedding didn't buy me.

11
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:34,099
He didn't even rent me, 
I'm going to sleep.


12
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,883
Give me your jewelry. 
I'll put them in the safe.


13
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,463
If you insist on flirting 
young people at parties ...


14
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:43,839
so do it in private.

15
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,273
I asked, but he didn't want 
to leave.


16
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:49,974
Remember that we are from 
high society.


17
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,640
I can't forget

18
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:54,634
Believe.

19
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:57,879
Freddie dear.

20
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,879
What?

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,077
Help me take off the dress ...

22
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,723
I'll be right there, first I want to keep 
your jewelry.


23
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:08,400
I always come first, 
remember.


24
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:12,660
Ready. I face.

25
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,538
Oh! Freddie...

26
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,214
Forget my cigarettes down there.

27
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,202
By God, Helen!

28
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:29,477
I'm ready to let me keep 
your jewelry.


29
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,622
Please dear.

30
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,283
Road!

31
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,144
Cigarettes.

32
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,153
I should have heard my sister.

33
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,762
Who the hell are you?

34
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,227
I took your cigarettes. 
Can we sleep?


35
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,462
Thank you dear..

36
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,714
Why don't you go down there 
a little?


37
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,582
Read? I'm exhausted. 
I'm going to sleep.


38
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,042
Well ... I'll take a shower.

39
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,094
You could also take one.

40
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,926
Burty installed 
modern heating.


41
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,490
Now he sweats like 
a pig.


42
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,599
I don't know where he got 
his nobility from.


43
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,657
He inherited the money, lives 
with the Cambridge class.


44
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,026
You like Malenkov, 
Belinsky.


45
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:48,652
What is the name? In favor 
of Stalin ... of Falsirink.


46
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,822
two communists from Shicklgruber.

47
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,999
In favor of everything but 
England


48
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,540
I don't know what Neville's about.

49
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:01,372
Sweet Fanny Adams.

50
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,118
Peace in our time!

51
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:13,470
Deu-Ihes to Austria, 
Czechoslovakia ...


52
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,814
I'll take a hot shower.

53
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:18,406
Goodnight Sweetheart.

54
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,686
Good evening, Mr. Lassiter. 
Thank you Harry.


55
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:46,676
Alï¿½ Nick.

56
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:47,990
Win for sure.

57
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,120
Not the way Galenta 
trains.


58
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,208
Train with Marlowe.

59
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,204
Do you know about the Louis-Walker fight?

60
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,694
Louis finished him off 
in the first round.


61
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,691
Allow-me Commander?

62
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:41,419
Excuse me. Whoever interrupts a 
dance is an American.


63
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,388
We don't do that here.

64
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,290
We try again.

65
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,471
I don't think so.

66
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,630
Just say what you want 
and go.


67
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:54,110
Let's go home.

68
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:55,542
What?

69
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,594
Didn't I tell you? That 
woman is my wife.


70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,862
For God.

71
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:02,471
If it doesn't go away I will have it 
removed.


72
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:03,701
It's okay,

73
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:06,216
I understand, you have a weakness for uniforms.

74
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,010
Her father was an admiral.

75
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,726
His mood is 
as bland as his manners.


76
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:11,691
Come with me.

77
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,181
Please be civilized.

78
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:17,502
It won't be long ... 
please.


79
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,276
As you wish.

80
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:39,495
- I apologize. 
- I really should.


81
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,910
He's an hour late. 
I was worried.


82
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,817
Having fun, Sara?

83
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,610
He was kind.

84
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,408
He invited me to go to 
Devon for the weekend.


85
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,321
I was tempted.

86
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,851
It seems that I arrived 
just in time.


87
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:54,031
Yes. I'm starving.

88
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,394
Didn't England feed it?

89
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,175
Jealous?

90
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,999
With envy.

91
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,688
Good.

92
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:03,051
No, I think I prefer you.

93
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,438
He is the only one who knows how to dance 
with a dancer.


94
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,487
That stood all night.

95
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,558
There's a table in the corner.

96
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,370
I'll order a small roast.

97
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,754
We will not wait. 
Let's go home.


98
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,210
I thought I was hungry.

99
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,053
We can eat in bed.

100
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,142
It's just one thing.

101
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:56,003
What?

102
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:58,625
Leave me a cup 
of coffee.


103
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,403
Kidneys.

104
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:06,723
One of these days ... you 
will get fat.


105
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,248
Voluptuous maybe, 
fat, never!


106
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:11,206
He's worse than a 
football player .


107
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,096
My profession is tough.

108
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,698
Turn around and I'll make you 
a new woman.


109
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:17,271
Can not wait.

110
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,187
Strong nothing.

111
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,527
Get in the car. 
Lassiter.


112
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,819
Form a queue.

113
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,478
Get away a little.

114
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,480
And you ... come on.

115
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,934
I think it's number four.

116
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:21,287
Absolutely, I'm sure.

117
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:22,980
You can talk.

118
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,305
Yes, him.

119
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:26,235
This is the man.

120
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:28,188
Good.

121
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:32,553
Right. Rodolfo Valentino stays.

122
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:35,998
The rest can go outside.

123
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:40,736
Get out, get out, come on. Move.

124
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:52,536
Do you know what that is?

125
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:53,445
Tramoia.

126
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:57,020
Right. It is a tramoia.

127
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:00,402
Fingerprints, witnesses ...

128
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:03,677
The guard's testimony. 
Even a gun.


129
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:06,215
You know what we think of weapons.

130
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:08,773
Get 20 years or 
life imprisonment.


131
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:11,122
I wanted you to see it to 
be sure.


132
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,401
What did I do?

133
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,700
Not yet decided.

134
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:21,025
This is Mr. Breeze. 
He will explain.


135
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,108
About Peter Breeze. 
To the FBI.


136
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:45,054
Collaborate and be a 
free man.


137
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:48,792
If I am wrong, it will be 
twenty hard years.


138
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,826
Nazis, outside 
Czechoslovakia.


139
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,968
Damn Nazis, 
fascist pigs.


140
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:14,182
Helmut Sanger, Ambassador 
of England.


141
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,515
When the Germans ...

142
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,240
invaded Techecoslov quia ...

143
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,156
received 50 million 
dollars.


144
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:21,871
in 
State Treasury diamonds .


145
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,319
Use to finance 
Europe's espionage ...


146
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,332
and South America.

147
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:31,046
of ten million dollars 
in London.


148
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,946

Raw diamonds precious stones.


149
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,940
Arrive on the Wednesday 
of the other week,


150
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:40,945
will stay at the Embassy 
until Friday.


151
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,119
If we can get them 
in England ...


152
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:47,854
we will delay its operation 
in South America.


153
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,596
Tell me what 
matters. Please.


154
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,813
We want you to steal.

155
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:07,620
Lassiter... Nï¿½o serï¿½ difï¿½cil,
nï¿½o para vocï¿½.


156
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,915
We will go to war 
soon, contribute.


157
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:14,071
I fell in a tragedy. 
Are you going to wrap me in the flag?


158
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:15,542
The safe is on the fourth floor.

159
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,843
The diamonds arrive on the 
fourth. You should do it.


160
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,826
I shouldn't. There are 
armed men there.


161
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,687
Em Sing-Sing, tambï¿½m.

162
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:36,239
We can find a way.

163
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,462
Churchill says to 
speak to Russia.


164
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,580
O New Star Standard.

165
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,763
Nazis.

166
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:06,581
Fascists.

167
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,386
This   Max Hofer, of the 
Gestapo ...


168
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,829
In charge of security.

169
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,250
Est  com Kari Von Fursten.

170
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,241
Her father, a great 
industrialist ...


171
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:18,917
was one of the first 
to join the party.


172
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:22,570
It is considered as a helper. 
But he is an informer.


173
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,155
They will take the diamonds 
to Buenos Aires.


174
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,628
There he will meet London.

175
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,369
Obviously. It's very wild.

176
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,883
Focus on Hofer, 
he is good and tough.


177
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,344
Play the role of bodyguard ...

178
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:42,363
maybe lover.

179
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:48,535
You must find a way 
to get past him.


180
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:52,138
If they catch me, will they 
call the cavalry?


181
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,726
Well. If they catch you at the 
Embassy, â€‹â€‹we can do nothing.


182
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,901
  the German Embassy , is the same 
as being in Berlin.


183
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,701
What a comfort.

184
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,245
I'm sorry, Lassiter.

185
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,516
Bullshit!

186
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,162
How much are you charging for a 
Bentley?


187
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,199
E aï¿½ Nick.

188
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,428
What's it.

189
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,012
Nothing.

190
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,153
You know, I like London.

191
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,882
I researched before coming 
here.


192
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,278
I came because it's my 
type of city.


193
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,367
The cops are not 
armed.


194
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,510
Chase the villains ...

195
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,644
but they don't kill them 
when they get them.


196
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,311
I call that civilized.

197
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,443
It's one of the reasons 
why you're leaving New York.


198
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,208
You can exercise your profession without 
fear of death.


199
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:14,094
Do not disappoint a 
car thief ...


200
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,257
saying that everything will change.

201
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:18,313
Let's go for a ride, 
Smoke.


202
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,849
Where are we going.

203
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,291
Na casa do Eddie Lee.

204
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,238
First stop at the 
next sign.


205
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,387
Clear.

206
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:28,050
You're not following me, 
not Breeze ?.


207
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,384
Now, it's my duty.

208
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:32,254
You can't go with 
Breeze.


209
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:34,079
What...

210
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,238
Lassiter.

211
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,596
Hey voc  ...

212
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,894
Look at that.

213
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,985
Good night.

214
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:04,998
Good night.

215
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,690
Are you trying to earn my money?

216
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:51,261
Olï¿½ Eddie.

217
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:52,998
Dou-This is a chance.

218
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,479
To get your money back at roulette.

219
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,459
Roulette is a set 
of cafeterias.


220
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,537
It depends on what you want to 
win.


221
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,116
Watch out.

222
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:09,657
She has many desires. 
Abnormal desires.


223
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,448
I speak from experience.

224
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,325
It has always been modest ...

225
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,186
Just introduce me.

226
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:33,851
Good night Kari. Good night Eddie.

227
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,754
Nick Lassiter.

228
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,643
Kari of princes.

229
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,073
MS. von Fursten 
  of the German Embassy .


230
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,165
Mr. Lassiter is an American.

231
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,740
How are you.

232
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,894
I've always admired diplomats.

233
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:49,540
Why, really?

234
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,101
They seduce friends 
and enemies.


235
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,460
And what you are.

236
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:58,049
What a difference it makes, as 
long as you like what you do.


237
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,383
I like men 
with scars.


238
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,392
Can I buy you a drink?

239
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:15,555
Always follow it?

240
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,583
Does he always follow you?

241
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,732
Sim.

242
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,584
Entï¿½o...

243
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:27,270
Eddie Lee, 
is one of your companions?


244
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,722
Sometimes.

245
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:30,994
Your friend?

246
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,510
We have the same interest, 
money.


247
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:36,330
They say he already killed, but 
he would never tell me.


248
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:38,788
Champagne. Pure Wisky.

249
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,472
No what I know.

250
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,480
Jï¿½ matou alguï¿½m,
Sr. Lassiter?


251
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,491
Tell me about Berlin.

252
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,561
I just like Berlin.

253
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:53,352
Shanghai can be 
interesting.


254
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,659
Who killed?

255
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,085
What is your interest?

256
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,370
For the fun.

257
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,999
There are amusements of 
all kinds.


258
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:08,930
Women with animals, 
drugs, little boys,


259
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,491
pleasure and pain.

260
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,454
Shocked?

261
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,776
I don't know, did my hair turn 
white?


262
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:21,914
I like you more and more.

263
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:44,914
What's it.

264
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,319
Over here.

265
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,135
My contact ...

266
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:50,677
Muller.

267
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:58,605
Excuse me.

268
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:00,392
We will meet here.

269
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,205
Who 
arranged the meeting, you?


270
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:03,388
He called me.

271
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:07,146
I'm afraid they know 
about you.


272
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:11,484
Perhaps.

273
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,927
Perhaps?

274
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,569
Maybe a roe!

275
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:24,349
Mr. Breeze. Inspector Becker will take 
care of the case for now.


276
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:25,965
What?

277
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:32,075
It gets very confusing 
for the aristocracy.


278
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:41,181
It was a knife, maybe a stylus.

279
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,132
Anyway, it 
was thin.


280
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,207
And now?

281
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:01,425
We will take care of this in 
a more rigid way.


282
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:02,985
My way.

283
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,684
The winner

284
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:09,586
I'm all dirty.

285
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:10,725
Nick!

286
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,731
Good to see you.

287
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,080
I hope you made 
money.


288
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:18,588
I never bet against you. 
The boxer had a good night.


289
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,236
You should be armed to 
beat a boxer yourself.


290
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,635
But it is good for such struggles, 
bear the pain.


291
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,627
And Mrs. I would like to rent it 
for the rest of the night.


292
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:29,256
Do this now?

293
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,236
It's a favor for 
a friend.


294
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:38,142
- She's shy. 
- Oh, yes, I see.


295
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,870
I don't think it would do 
for her.


296
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,684
It is a little more "graceful" 
outside the ring.


297
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,320
If you understand me.

298
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:47,538
You're kidding.

299
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:54,877
Well ... she's interested in 
how she takes the pain


300
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:58,467
I don't think so. 
I'm sorry, Nick.


301
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,225
All right, be well.

302
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:05,409
He refused.

303
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:09,294
Then you will take me home.

304
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:15,209
It would be ... inconvenient.

305
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:16,784
Really?

306
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,114
Okay, it's Max.

307
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:50,963
  for her, whoever she is ...

308
00:30:50,998 --> 00:30:53,961
know that there is someone else 
behind you.


309
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:58,574
Men like you 
always have lovers.


310
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:04,159
So it's interesting. 
Call me.


311
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:06,783
But don't 
let me wait.


312
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:09,178
I couldn't take 
blood loss.


313
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,351
Eat a fillet first.

314
00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:46,047
Not what you think.

315
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:47,669
Really?

316
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:49,000
There was nothing.

317
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:53,268
I understand why is cheio 
de baton?


318
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,649
I can't stand lies.

319
00:31:57,714 --> 00:32:00,313
Everything but lies.

320
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,786
I tell you when to lie.

321
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,526
Be more honest.

322
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,084
Anything else to say?

323
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:11,821
No, because I feel 
ridiculous.


324
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:14,379
If you were guilty we would 
also argue ...


325
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,333
but I would have had 
better fun.


326
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:18,359
Have a good time.

327
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:22,896
Come on, Sara, wait. 
Please!


328
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,327
Sorry, don't you understand?

329
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,130
You can't understand.

330
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:33,238
Trapped. 
I'm going to jail.


331
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:36,273
- Want to scare me? - No.

332
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:39,982
I know ... it sounds crazy, 
but Scotland Yard


333
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:43,691
you want me to steal 10 
million in diamonds ...


334
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:45,213
or I'll catch him.

335
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,806
They can't do 
that. There are laws.


336
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,999
Laws are for citizens 
who follow it.


337
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,788
We can escape to Rome 
or anywhere.


338
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:55,422
Sara, I can't!

339
00:32:57,221 --> 00:33:01,145
What alternative do you have ... 
Are you going to steal them?


340
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:07,947
Nick, I'm going 
anywhere with you.


341
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,719
But it must be now, 
I mean it.


342
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,946
Sara, I didn't want to promise

343
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,160
something I can't.

344
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,715
It means you don't want to.

345
00:33:16,716 --> 00:33:21,295
Conhe o vooc  ... He feared 
greatness mania.


346
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:26,703
Someone gave the cards 
and I play them.


347
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:30,219
He's got bad cards 
this time.


348
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,661
Do you know what that 
reminds me of?


349
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:46,240
The two of us like this here.

350
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:50,689
The time of the dry law. 
Smuggling.


351
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:55,499
- Yes ...- Planted on the roads 
outside New York ...


352
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:59,800
waiting for the Dutch 
with the shipment.


353
00:34:00,095 --> 00:34:03,367
- Remember? - Yes.

354
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:06,881
I was young to 
find everything fun.


355
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:08,896
It was fun.

356
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:14,332
We've been here for an hour.

357
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,372
Why is the FBI 
guy important?


358
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,828
Look, be patient. 
I have to talk to him.


359
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:22,629
Breeze preencher  us buracos.

360
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:24,811
Give me one.

361
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:27,102
Haven't you stopped smoking?

362
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,793
And I stopped.

363
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,964
What is that?

364
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:03,322
It doesn't seem friendly.

365
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,000
I know.

366
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,483
Thank you, Lassiter.

367
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,795
You saved me.

368
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:32,131
I should have let 
you kill him.


369
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:37,635
You owe one. Don't expect me to do 
it again.


370
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:57,893
My house, my 
damn house!


371
00:37:57,894 --> 00:38:00,802
You bastard! Don't come 
to a man's house.


372
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:06,327
Should I call someone?

373
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:11,684
Nothing ... Finish your coffee. 
Everything is fine.


374
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:22,361
I'm out, Becker. 
Since already.


375
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,612
Leave when I say.

376
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,394
They tried to kill Breeze.

377
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:27,625
But it didn't work.

378
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,461
We will say that it was a 
gas explosion.


379
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:31,065
Gels are dangerous.

380
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,704
It was an 
assassination attempt , against the law.


381
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,834
Don't tell me about the law! 
You are a thief.


382
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,503
This is not easy. 
Do you know where the safe is?


383
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,597
He took me to Mata Hari.

384
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:45,427
The information can 
come from a source.


385
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:48,705
There's someone inside, you 
don't need me.


386
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:52,048
We have somebody inside.

387
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:54,965
He was killed, right?

388
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:58,587
If it were easy, I would have 
my wife do it.


389
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,874
Locks are useless 
for thieves.


390
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,310
I'm leaving.

391
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:52,463
I want you to come with me.

392
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:55,073
What happened, Nick?

393
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:58,379
I finished with everything. 
It's finished.


394
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,917
Are you sure?

395
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:06,266
Won't you look 
back?


396
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:09,293
I'll try.

397
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,363
Paris.

398
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:33,143
Milï¿½o.

399
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:34,314
Roma.

400
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,796
Venice?

401
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:36,783
Istanbul.

402
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,660
Istanbul? No.

403
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,528
Is it really easy?

404
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,309
I take what's important 
to me.


405
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:46,223
Liked it

406
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,755
Why do you always 
do that?


407
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:50,835
What?

408
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:52,309
Eat my food.

409
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:54,380
I like her better.

410
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,003
If you wanted chicken, 
why didn't you ask?


411
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,782
Wanted veal

412
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:58,786
He ordered veal.

413
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:02,357
So I can eat 
both.


414
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:06,717
Mrs. and Mrs. Folkestone 
in ten minutes.


415
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:09,238
We will arrive in time for 
dinner in Paris.


416
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:12,301
I will eat like a 
pig.


417
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,012
Maybe not.

418
00:41:24,322 --> 00:41:25,648
I'm impressed.

419
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:27,413
  to be.

420
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:30,192
This is Inspector 
Becker ...


421
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:32,918
About which I told 
wonderful things.


422
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,395
I will make a speech.

423
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:40,245
There may be three things 
for you.


424
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,301
I think they're all good.

425
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:45,324
One. You go in and get 
the diamonds.


426
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:47,508
I get a pat on the 
back ...


427
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,580
for something that my superiors 
did not do.


428
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,281
Two, you come in and 
kill him.


429
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:53,426
I would like this.

430
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:55,601
Tr s, voc  n o enters ...

431
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:59,334
and gets twenty years 
in prison or a life sentence.


432
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:03,122
Aging in a cage, 
I would love to.


433
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:07,269
It's better to get the diamonds.

434
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:08,891
Today is Monday.

435
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,685
The diamonds will arrive 
on Wednesday.


436
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:14,034
If theyâ€™re not with me 
on Friday,


437
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,241
I end up with a voice.

438
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,702
Let's go dear?

439
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,714
It is always a pleasure 
gentlemen ...


440
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:32,967
Oh ... don't think about getting off the 
train in London.


441
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:34,887
Oh, Becker.

442
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:38,989
He doesn't trust people, 
it's an ugly custom.


443
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,514
He really hates it.

444
00:42:49,056 --> 00:42:49,953
Why?

445
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:53,445
- It's a thief. 
- There are many thieves.


446
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:56,361
Quem ï¿½ vocï¿½ Breeze, heim.

447
00:42:56,362 --> 00:42:57,552
FBI.

448
00:42:57,593 --> 00:43:00,200
What is that? 
I'm a cop.


449
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,070
I'm not soft.

450
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:05,383
Nï¿½o perdï¿½o e nï¿½o
esqueï¿½o.


451
00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:10,035
He was a thief yesterday and he is 
a thief tonight.


452
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:13,105
He'll be a thief tomorrow, 
but not here.


453
00:43:13,436 --> 00:43:15,314
Not in my district.

454
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:19,462
- We made a deal. 
- Don't be naive, Breeze.


455
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,470
I bet the Germans are 
going to kill him.


456
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:24,227
ï¿½ possï¿½vel.

457
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:27,509
What if he lives to get 
his share?


458
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,837
Go get it assim 
mesmo, n o?


459
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:33,227
Of course I will, it's his 
place.


460
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:08,109
Newspaper!

461
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,506
Buy your newspaper!

462
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,946
Newspaper!

463
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,033
My God...

464
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,201
Get that out of the way.

465
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:03,841
Go very calmly. 
Don't push, right!


466
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:17,696
Get the horse!

467
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:40,054
Where did this bastard go?

468
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,016
Hey, everyone knows.

469
00:45:57,017 --> 00:46:00,096
- The police are behind 
you. - Yes.


470
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:02,507
Becker tried but 
I'm still here.


471
00:46:02,508 --> 00:46:05,105
There are rumors that 
you are hot.


472
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:13,899
I know ... Would ten million diamonds 
cool me down?


473
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:19,561
Dï¿½lares?

474
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:23,999
It will be difficult to move it.

475
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,845
The best I can offer 
is 15 cents per dollar.


476
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,703
Well, everyone wants something, why 
would it be any different?


477
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:40,057
Look, the stones are not 
worked.


478
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,327
No owners.

479
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:44,601
In war they are worth 
more than gold.


480
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:47,443
It will be easier to 
pass them on.


481
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,636
Sixty.

482
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:52,321
Twenty.

483
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:55,253
Forty.

484
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:00,313
Done.

485
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,667
Prepare the money.

486
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,051
Ser  amanh  ou 
depois.


487
00:47:11,673 --> 00:47:14,746
I'm in a hurry I 
wo n't take the tea.


488
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:31,269
Alï¿½.

489
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:25,009
Don't be silly it won't be 
long, I promise.


490
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,405
Stay still.

491
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:28,404
I don't want to go 
home.


492
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,388
Behave yourself and I'll give you 
an ice cream.


493
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:33,123
I don't want to.

494
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:38,476
Alem culture admires 
Mr. Lassiter?


495
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,763
Well, where do I come from ...

496
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,636
we like light things, you 
know?


497
00:48:46,817 --> 00:48:49,247
Like Mickey Mouse?

498
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:52,639
Is Kari here?

499
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:54,912
He went to the consulate.

500
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:56,437
Come back here.

501
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:57,609
Times.

502
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:07,549
Take it.

503
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:27,737
Don't touch him, 
he's a boy.


504
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:29,061
You don't know what 
you do.


505
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,264
I should kill him Max.

506
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,179
Nick. Max sï¿½ mata
adultos.


507
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,774
So ... did you 
eat your steak today?


508
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,925
Are you going to hunt today?

509
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:49,716
I will not hunt, I will kill.

510
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,811
Birds are hunted. 
It's not sport.


511
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:53,029
Why do you kill them?

512
00:49:53,506 --> 00:49:55,755
I like to kill them, 
don't you?


513
00:49:55,756 --> 00:49:59,141
Yes, but in a club, 
where someone holds them.


514
00:49:59,632 --> 00:50:02,640
Come with me, dear. 
I'm sure...


515
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:03,833
that we will find 
the club.


516
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:06,829
Come you, I'll see you 
when I get back.


517
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:09,161
We'll miss you.

518
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,608
Max likes you, 
you make him laugh.


519
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,020
I am seeing.

520
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:18,081
See you later.

521
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:23,988
Who is Nick Lassiter, 
why are you here?


522
00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:47,320
Hey Smoke! Do you have a cigarette 
for me?


523
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:48,969
He promised his mother.

524
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,359
It was a piece of cake.

525
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,972
I don't know if I hated or loved ...

526
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,486
but I understand why you 
do that.


527
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:05,527
How is it up there?

528
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:07,283
There is a guard behind 
a fence.


529
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:09,241
It looks very strong.

530
00:51:09,242 --> 00:51:11,441
The doors are locked.

531
00:51:11,442 --> 00:51:12,792
Everyone is armed.

532
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,730
Two of the windows I 
saw have bars.


533
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:17,725
There are iron doors 
everywhere.


534
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:20,261
Let's go out. Okay, what else?

535
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,003
Say exactly 
what you saw.


536
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,072
Hey George. You will have to take it 
apart.


537
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:47,259
Hey. I managed to fix 
the bumper.


538
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,965
Hi George.

539
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:53,481
Hey Nick.

540
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,338
Al  Breeze. 
It's beautiful!


541
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:00,667
Thank you.

542
00:52:00,668 --> 00:52:02,752
Remember 
dear Peter Breeze?


543
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,628
Yes, I know who it is.

544
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:08,147
Is it fun to forge an innocent? 
Mr. Breeze


545
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:11,511
Not innocent, not 
caught yet.


546
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:16,321
If they catch him this time, they 
'll kill him.


547
00:52:16,322 --> 00:52:19,066
If successful, it will save 
many lives.


548
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:19,960
Wait.

549
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:22,315
You don't get someone 
to commit suicide ...


550
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:25,391
and congratulate yourself for 
having a hero.


551
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,090
If you want to save lives, 
save them yourself.


552
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:31,273
Now Sara, Breeze is 
bound, it's her duty.


553
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,492
Look. We will provide 
full coverage .


554
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:37,637
Why I didn't like a 
hatter.


555
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:52,447
God ... how wonderful. There are 
beautiful cars here.


556
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,650
- They cost a fortune. No? 
- No, no.


557
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,894
They are stolen.

558
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,582
Stolen?

559
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:06,459
I'm sorry I upset 
Miss. Wells with it all.


560
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,548
Me too. 
Let's end it all.


561
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,636
Don't laugh at me, 
Lassiter.


562
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:13,812
I can be sentimental, 
there are lives in that.


563
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,992
There will be a war and 
America will enter it.


564
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:20,536
Like it or not, it's 
your country ...


565
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:22,926
and you care more about 
him than you show.


566
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:27,137
Look. I ask not to run away 
again.


567
00:53:27,198 --> 00:53:31,365
Becker watches over him, wants a 
reason to arrest him.


568
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,405
- What? -Have one and will 
do anything to use it.


569
00:53:37,522 --> 00:53:39,953
It will arrest me 
anyway.


570
00:53:39,981 --> 00:53:41,998
You will do nothing 
to help me


571
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:44,400
or get it too.

572
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:46,200
Sure?

573
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:53,688
Lassiter...

574
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:01,292
Goodnight Sweetheart.

575
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:03,991
It's beautiful! ... 
Am I right?


576
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:05,542
Nï¿½o.

577
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,461
What is that? 
Send her away.


578
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:11,158
Don't be sure you 
're going to lose it, my dear.


579
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,039
End the fun 
if there is no dispute.


580
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,139
I'm not in it for 
fun.


581
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:18,624
Send her away.

582
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,731
I will not sit here 
with her.


583
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:26,095
Don't provoke me Sara. 
I can do nothing.


584
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:28,244
Enough Lassiter!

585
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,907
Don't touch me!

586
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:37,417
Be quiet and sit there. 
I need her.


587
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,586
No. I said I would help you ...

588
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,461
but I donâ€™t help sleeping 
with her.


589
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:43,621
Don't do this to me.

590
00:55:43,622 --> 00:55:45,690
Prometheus. 
Now choose.


591
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:49,167
I choose you. I don't have 
time, it must be tonight.


592
00:55:50,053 --> 00:55:51,782
Stay away from me.

593
00:56:04,892 --> 00:56:07,104
What a lovely miss.

594
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:08,676
Let's get out of here.

595
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:22,468
Entertain me, Nick. 
Just a little.


596
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,742
She must be good.

597
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:28,560
He stayed longer than 
he needed to.


598
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,206
He arranged everything except 
one thing.


599
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:33,980
It was the wrong safe.

600
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,545
- As well? 
- Give me the diamonds!


601
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:38,847
There were only 
her jewelry in the safe.


602
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:41,374
Skirt! Search him.

603
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,208
Nothing.

604
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:52,845
If you fool me Lassiter, this 
will be your last day on the streets.


605
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:55,043
Voc    um bastardo, Becker!

606
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,035
If there's another safe, 
I don't know where it is.


607
01:01:57,036 --> 01:02:00,979
Your bad luck, get 
in there again today.


608
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,991
To knock on 
each door?


609
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:05,625
It's a thief. 
It doesn't matter what you do.


610
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:09,987
Until you find the 
diamonds, don't leave.


611
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:49,109
Very good.

612
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:58,521
Okay, girls, ten 
minutes.


613
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:11,243
Srta. Wells...

614
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:13,968
Inspector Becker, 
Sergeant Allyce.


615
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:18,021
Inspector Becker ... 
Yes, yes. Thank you Breeze.


616
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:23,212
MS. Wells. Tell everything that 
Lassiter told you.


617
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:26,608
Like every man, say 
what I want to hear.


618
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:27,409
I'm not talking about that.

619
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,865
I speak of your plans.

620
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:31,862
No matter, leave me 
alone. It's all over.


621
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,261
Ended?

622
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:38,857
It just started. I say 
when it's over.


623
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:41,457
Calma, Becker.

624
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:43,289
One more word ...

625
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,661
and I'm going to send Allyce to 
get you out of here. Hem?


626
01:03:48,149 --> 01:03:51,998
Lassiter is very 
happy ... why?


627
01:03:53,104 --> 01:03:57,314
- I don't know - Damn it 
!


628
01:03:57,469 --> 01:04:01,720
Why don't you say it? 
He humiliated her in public.


629
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:05,424
It ended you in 
front of everyone.


630
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:09,609
It doesn't matter.

631
01:04:09,686 --> 01:04:12,874
Listen, this is the deal 
.


632
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:15,736
It stuck easily, it will 
go to prison.


633
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:19,075
If I have to look for him, 
I'll kill him.


634
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:20,915
Understood?

635
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:30,915
Search for a receiver.

636
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:35,015
Alguï¿½m Ihe darï¿½
dez milhï¿½es.


637
01:04:59,975 --> 01:05:01,514
Can I talk to you?

638
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:04,290
Do we have anything to say?

639
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:24,341
- Where do I put it? 
- On the kitchen table.


640
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:30,115
It didn't work ... 
I'll be back tonight.


641
01:05:31,009 --> 01:05:31,945
I don't want to know.

642
01:05:31,946 --> 01:05:34,131
You will suffer the consequences 
of your actions.


643
01:05:34,132 --> 01:05:35,951
Or is it an 
unhappy metaphor ?


644
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:37,339
Lack of charity.

645
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,845
I have no charity.

646
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,077
Sara...

647
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:44,341
I planned everything. 
I know how to beat Becker.


648
01:05:45,397 --> 01:05:47,298
Becker set me up 
.


649
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:48,853
He said he's looking for 
a receiver.


650
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:50,667
It doesn't matter. 
I will never find it.


651
01:05:50,668 --> 01:05:56,059
You know what? Nick. 
I kept the boxes long ago.


652
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,964
Every time I saw them, 
I felt good ...


653
01:05:57,965 --> 01:05:59,994
I knew I did open them,

654
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:01,657
when viv ssemos 
juntos always.


655
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:04,135
I already said you're 
right, I'll make it.


656
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,613
No, they will kill you. 
I don't want to see that.


657
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:11,902
If it works tonight, 
it will mean nothing without you.


658
01:06:18,277 --> 01:06:22,345
I'm in a hurry, I'm just going to 
make a phone call.


659
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,396
Call Inspector Becker.

660
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,015
Sim.

661
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:46,001
Hofer.

662
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,213
Captain Hofer gives 
German embassy.


663
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:49,251
J  be.

664
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:51,373
I want to know about 
Nicholas Lassiter.


665
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,234
Who?

666
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:57,974
Please, sir. Lee, 
I saw them together.


667
01:06:57,975 --> 01:06:59,880
I did some research.

668
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,611
Lassiter has been my friend 
for years.


669
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,247
I am willing 
to pay.


670
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:11,001
A lot, I hope.

671
01:07:11,002 --> 01:07:14,181
Just seeing my friends 
for a lot of money.


672
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:40,463
Excuse me.

673
01:07:44,235 --> 01:07:47,855
Nice house. 
Very elegant.


674
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,574
How much did you earn 
last year?


675
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:58,428
Do you know how much I won? 
3,123 dollars.


676
01:07:58,429 --> 01:08:01,514
And you, ten times more? 
It's likely, isn't it?


677
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:05,220
Breeze stop, you have no nerves 
for such a thing.


678
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:07,706
No, no, no. I just ask.

679
01:08:07,707 --> 01:08:12,071
Don't think. Forget it, you're going to be 
in trouble.


680
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,501
You know ... 
I may not care about that.


681
01:08:16,502 --> 01:08:18,991
Breeze to the strip. One 
of the blond boys from Hoover.


682
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:21,227
- work, not 
religion. - Breeze ...


683
01:08:28,844 --> 01:08:31,087
Ent o. When are you going 
encontr -la?


684
01:08:32,115 --> 01:08:32,905
Logo

685
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:35,580
Is it really that easy? 
You are amazing.


686
01:08:35,581 --> 01:08:37,548
What if she won't let you 
in tonight?


687
01:08:37,549 --> 01:08:39,561
You can argue.

688
01:08:39,857 --> 01:08:43,633
You know, she may have a 
headache.


689
01:08:49,116 --> 01:08:51,362
Okay, you're right.

690
01:08:54,852 --> 01:08:57,068
Por que nï¿½o toma
um drink, Breeze.


691
01:08:57,082 --> 01:08:58,573
Good idea.

692
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,640
Lassiter...

693
01:11:22,317 --> 01:11:23,473
Come on.

694
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:24,460
God...

695
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:26,300
Let's go. 
Let's go!


696
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:29,419
You didn't think everyone 
would come out alive, did you?


697
01:11:29,538 --> 01:11:30,509
Come on!

698
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,033
Come on, Breeze!

699
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,879
Breeze!

700
01:11:39,857 --> 01:11:43,593
Breeze ... We have a lot of 
work to do


701
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:46,858
It won't be easier 
if we wait.


702
01:11:48,352 --> 01:11:50,894
What are you talking about?

703
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,782
Hofer must have 
told Kari.


704
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:55,093
She must know!

705
01:11:55,128 --> 01:11:56,404
That's right.

706
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,596
I will be waiting.

707
01:11:58,925 --> 01:12:00,810
You will wait for 
the bell to ring.


708
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:02,568
I don't touch, I'll stop 
waiting.


709
01:12:02,603 --> 01:12:04,398
No other entry.

710
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,086
Yes, but it is not 
easy.


711
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:09,100
No, no, I will cancel the 
operation.


712
01:12:09,101 --> 01:12:11,824
I will 
tell Becker that there is no way.


713
01:12:11,825 --> 01:12:12,867
My superiors will support you.

714
01:12:12,902 --> 01:12:18,799
No! ... I really want this ... 
there is a way.


715
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:22,986
Tell Smoke to come here ...

716
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:26,069
while I dress. 
Understood?


717
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,612
We arrived at the embassy. 
It's dangerous.


718
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:49,886
  madness, the best 
  cancel everything.


719
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:52,523
Don't Breeze, it's too late.

720
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:56,098
It's horrible. 
I've never done that before.


721
01:12:58,143 --> 01:13:00,050
Not eu.

722
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:09,008
Stay here. If you don't leave 
twenty minutes ...


723
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,980
I won't leave anymore.

724
01:13:23,105 --> 01:13:24,691
Abram portï¿½o!

725
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,954
The taximeter runs and the 
guy sleeps in the car.


726
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:31,493
Quiet, do you want to wake 
everyone up ?


727
01:13:32,882 --> 01:13:34,745
He drank too much.

728
01:13:35,095 --> 01:13:38,231
  Schnapps. 
Totally b bado.


729
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:57,569
Okay.

730
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,143
He slept.

731
01:14:42,553 --> 01:14:44,689
- Sleep well. - Yes.

732
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,610
Good night. 
Heil Hitler.


733
01:15:35,176 --> 01:15:38,613
I worked twelve hours, 
I'm tired.


734
01:17:56,111 --> 01:17:58,403
Stop, if I don't pull!

735
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,999
Stop or shoot!

736
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:06,294
Stopped!

737
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:26,388
H  algu m ali.

738
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,451
See what I found.

739
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,914
Jochen, come! Come on!

740
01:18:51,483 --> 01:18:54,073
Out. 
Out!


741
01:18:57,406 --> 01:18:59,306
Close the door.

742
01:20:44,915 --> 01:20:46,280
Up there!

743
01:21:55,329 --> 01:21:57,184
What's up?

744
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:05,746
No turn, Breeze.

745
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,134
Are you ... okay?

746
01:22:15,544 --> 01:22:17,999
Becker is 
across the street.


747
01:22:20,067 --> 01:22:22,481
What will you do 
about it?


748
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:28,745
N o be.

749
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,638
Did you get them?

750
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:33,874
That's why I came here. 
Breeze.


751
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,897
I have the diamonds 
and the Germans don't.


752
01:22:36,914 --> 01:22:40,206
- It was what you wanted, right? - Yes.

753
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:02,537
It seems!

754
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,201
Look, police!

755
01:23:07,202 --> 01:23:09,279
Don't let it escape.

756
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:30,106
It's not over Breeze ... It 
just got more difficult.


757
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:30,845
Softened. Pass by to 
talk to the girl.


758
01:24:31,085 --> 01:24:34,536
- What a stupid guy! - Hmm.

759
01:24:57,031 --> 01:24:59,902
He won't come.

760
01:25:02,205 --> 01:25:04,666
What do you think, didn't 
find a taxi?


761
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:09,891
You fooled us, miss.

762
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,891
He used it as bait.

763
01:25:13,892 --> 01:25:16,346
I fell straight.

764
01:25:17,599 --> 01:25:20,347
Help me, will you?

765
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,016
Do you know who his 
receiver is?


766
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:30,063
Help me out.

767
01:26:24,081 --> 01:26:26,213
It's all there.

768
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,737
Can I see the 
rocks, eh?


769
01:26:34,692 --> 01:26:37,215
Well, I'll be going now.

770
01:26:40,013 --> 01:26:43,271
Catch some fish. 
On the house.


771
01:26:43,272 --> 01:26:45,764
I just retired.

772
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:21,956
Decrease that. 
Decrease that, okay!


773
01:28:21,957 --> 01:28:23,480
Go behind him.

774
01:28:39,585 --> 01:28:43,396
Get out, get out of the car! 
Soon, get out!


775
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:45,134
You want me to knock on 
their door ...


776
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:47,170
to ask our 
thief back?


777
01:29:47,778 --> 01:29:51,626
It's over, Breeze. 
He's dead.


778
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,052
Don't do that.

779
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,639
I'm sorry.

780
01:30:33,377 --> 01:30:34,917
Please don't blame Nick.

781
01:30:34,918 --> 01:30:36,523
He had no choice.

782
01:30:36,524 --> 01:30:38,897
He didn't think he 
could lose.


783
01:30:39,274 --> 01:30:41,192
I was sure 
I wasn't going.


784
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:56,606
Hey!

785
01:30:58,082 --> 01:31:00,824
It seems. No, attractive!

786
01:31:25,214 --> 01:31:27,504
Olï¿½, otï¿½rios.

787
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:57,011
Will you come with us?

788
01:31:58,203 --> 01:31:59,686
Thanks but.

789
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,265
I couldn't take the bite.
