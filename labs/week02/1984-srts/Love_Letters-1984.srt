("Contrapunctus 1" by
 Johann Sebastian Bach)

2
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,058
(gun bangs)

3
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,333
(birds chirping)

4
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,379
(dramatic music)

5
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,247
- [Joseph] My darling,

6
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,117
remembering as I sit
 here those last days

7
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,319
before we met in Los Angeles,

8
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,656
they now seem very significant.

9
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,125
For though they consisted
  only in waiting,

10
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,062
I knew as I waited, my
  life was about to change.

11
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,066
And even though I've
 returned home now

12
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,069
and all likelihood,
 never see you again,

13
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,073
it is true that I am a
 new and better person

14
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,742
for with you I have known
  the fullest love possible.

15
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,552
(fire crackling)
(dramatic music)

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,943
- It feels like a long time ago.

17
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,046
Six months, it's
 not so long really.

18
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,349
All this began then.

19
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,117
Is she up?

20
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,453
Just as it ended now with Mama.

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,358
(hand knocking)

22
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,959
Mama?

23
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,060
- Anna, come in.

24
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,467
- What are sitting here
with the lights off for?

25
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,204
- (chuckles) Waiting for
you, listening for you.

26
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,409
What's this?
 - What do you think?

27
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,514
- Oh, gardenias, my
 favorite (laughs).

28
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,418
It's not even the season.
  - Dr. Barnkin,

29
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,419
please call Station 27.
- Smell.

30
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,859
(Maggie inhales
  deeply and sighs)

31
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,995
Did you listen to
  my show, today?

32
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,297
- Don't I always (laughs)?

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,503
Anna, you're the only thing
 in my life that's really

34
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,072
turned out.

35
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,676
That I can really be proud of.

36
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,711
I want you to know that.

37
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,347
- Please don't, Mama.

38
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,985
- You won't make the same
  kinda mistakes that I did.

39
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,788
You're so much smarter
 than I ever was.

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,224
I have.

41
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,061
- [Nurse] Dr. Barnkin,

42
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,832
please report to geriatrics.
 - Something important for you.

43
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,737
You've never seen this before.

44
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,342
I've had it for a
  long, long time.

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,144
- Who gave it to you?

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,747
Not Daddy.

47
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,784
- It doesn't fit anymore.

48
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,688
I never really could
 wear it anyway.

49
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,794
I want you to have it now.

50
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,062
- I'll keep it for you

51
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,299
'til ya get better.

52
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:28,968
- All right.

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,838
- I love you.

54
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,610
- [Maggie] Just go ahead
  the way you've been going.

55
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,979
I know you'll be fine.

56
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,484
- Hi, Daddy.

57
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,952
- [Chuck] Hi.

58
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,254
- [Nurse] Dr. Cameron,
  please meet Dr. Bock in--

59
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,858
- Well, how are
  we feelin', today?

60
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:56,462
- Oh, about the same.
 (lips smacking)

61
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,296
- How's work?

62
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,132
- Work's okay.

63
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,734
New owners are nice.

64
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,671
Looks like they're
  gonna keep me on.

65
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,374
Koreans (laughs).

66
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,944
- I have to go.

67
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,047
- So soon?

68
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,416
- I have a 6 a.m. show.

69
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
Don't get up for it, okay?

70
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,388
I'll see you tomorrow.

71
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,924
Bye, Daddy.

72
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,758
- Bye.

73
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,637

("Prelude 15" by
Frederic Chopin)

75
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,477
- You've been listening to
 the Obsessions in Music show

76
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,980
here at KLAS, your listener
 supported radio station,

77
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,582
where it's all
 music all the time.

78
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,117
Coming up next is
  Danny De Fronso

79
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,153
and the Roots of Rock 'N' Roll.

80
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,954
- Now, it's time to
enjoy some real culture

81
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,723
and I mean with a capital C,

82
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,959
so here from the '50s are
 The Capitols and Speed Row.

83
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,061
(rock music)
 Anna.

84
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,196
God, I'm sorry I'm late.

85
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,264
Thanks for coverin' for me.

86
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,565
- Where were ya last night?

87
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,401
- I heard the most
incredible band, again.

88
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,603
- The guy out there
 in the gray sweater,

89
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,538
ya know him?

90
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,839
- I'm tryin' to pick his pocket

91
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,341
for the Evening in
 New Music concerts.

92
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,276
- He's a donor?

93
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,110
- That guy's loaded.

94
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,611
God bless him.

95
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,813
- Play me some Shirelles
for the ride home, okay?

96
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,814
- You got it.
 - Bye.

97
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,148
- See ya later.
- Oh.

98
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,551
(rock music)

99
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,394
Oh, I'm sorry.
(Oliver laughs)

100
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,229
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

101
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,631
- You're Anna
 Winter, aren't you?

102
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,367
- Mm-hmm.
  - Hi, I'm Oliver Andrews.

103
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,936
I'm a fan, a very
  big fan of yours.

104
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,138
I listen to you all the time.
 - That's great.

105
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,372
I've always wanted a fan.

106
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,743
It's been nice to
 meet you, Mr. Andrews.

107
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,213
Excuse me.
- Nice to meet you, too.

108
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,814
Anna, I hope I'll
 be seeing you again.

109
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,549
In the meantime,
  I'll be listening.

110
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,324
- If you're a widower, do you
 still wear a wedding ring?

111
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,859
- I don't know.

112
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,094
You know this is a hangup
  with you, father figures.

113
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,395
- Harley wasn't that much older.

114
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,698
- (scoffs) Yeah, Harley
was an aberration.

115
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,932
- [Anna] I'll say.

116
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,900
You wanna carry
  this for a minute?

117
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,668
- Not much; okay, I will.

118
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,938
I had an actual date
 the other night.

119
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,873
- Yeah, how'd it go?

120
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,274
- (chuckles) Oh, really badly.

121
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,243
This guy got loaded and
proceeded to tell me

122
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,679
his entire life story.
 - Yeah?

123
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,181
At least ya got a
 good meal out of it.

124
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,383
- No way, wasn't anyway I was
 gonna end up owing that guy.

125
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,886
Dutch treat, he woulda
 jumped me for sure.

126
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,121
Listen, you wanna go to
my house or your house?

127
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,955
- [Anna] Mine.

128
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,892
- I'm goin' celibate,
 I'm givin' up men.

129
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,127
I mean, I'm really
  sick and tired

130
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,595
of tryin' to find some kinda guy

131
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:53,532
that is witty, intelligent,
 rich, handsome.

132
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:55,167
- [Anna] You just want
 a Prince Charming.

133
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,003
- Yeah and why not?

134
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,138
All I ever get are these
kinda guys that grumble

135
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,573
outta the bedroom
  in the morning.

136
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,276
They smell, they never
 even help you make the bed.

137
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,278
- Now, you're
 talkin' about George.

138
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,813
- Good ol' George, dropped
  his clothes everywhere

139
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,882
and expected me to pick 'em up.

140
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,718
- You did.
- Well, somebody had to.

141
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,487
I'm tellin' you, that guy
  couldn't even fry an egg

142
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,722
without asking me 15 questions.

143
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,957
How hot should the pan be?

144
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,358
Where's the thing
  ya flip it with?

145
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,560
How can I tell when it's done?

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,529
- He just wanted a mama.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,166
He wanted a mama,
  you wanna papa.

148
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,370
(scoffs) You know, no wonder
you and George never got along.

149
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,772
- You just pick the
 wrong guys, Wendy.

150
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,706
- So what else is new?

151
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,341
It's like a national disease.

152
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,909
Look at Harley.
(lighter clicks)

153
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,911
- Harley is a national
 disease (laughs).

154
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,218
- You know, it's not George.

155
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,553
It's not Harley.

156
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,854
It's men in general.

157
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,456
They're an inferior breed.

158
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,261
(woeful organ music)

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,258
- Excuse me, are you
 Maggie's daughter?

160
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,428
I sang with your
 mother in the choir.

161
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,999
I just want you to know
 that we loved her very much.

162
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,401
She was a real live wire.

163
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,907
Oh, Chuck, you come
 to dinner next week.

164
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,642
Be sure.
 - Thank you, Frank.

165
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,179
Ready to go, hun?

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,493
(water splashing)

167
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:06,932
Good.

168
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,168
Good cake.

169
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,984
Your mother had
 some things upstairs

170
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,352
you might wanna go through.

171
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,090
I want you to take anything.

172
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,894
Anything

173
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,564
that you might want.

174
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,869
Anything you think
  should be saved.

175
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,337
- What are ya gonna do, Daddy?

176
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,442
- I kinda hoped you might

177
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,346
come by a little
  more often than...

178
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,951
I know you and your mother
 were very close (sniffles).

179
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,954
- Daddy?
- I'm all right!

180
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,194
- Daddy?
- I'm all right.

181
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,065
You just go upstairs.

182
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,441
(intense music)

183
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,054
(dog barking)

184
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,322
Come on, Sammy.

185
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,729
(mysterious music)

186
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,435
- [Joseph] My darling,

187
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,839
during the last weeks, I
couldn't write as often as you,

188
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,542
but it was the press of
work and nothing else

189
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,544
that stopped the flow.

190
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,613
Most of the time, I can
 hardly believe you're married.

191
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,283
I love you.

192
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,386
My love and need seem
a permanent part of me,

193
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,624
a part that will not disappear
 in a year or 10 or 20.

194
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,962
You are the woman of my heart

195
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,400
and I'm happy you are
  despite all the obstacles,

196
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,568
the impossibilities.

197
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,437
I am yours, Joseph.

198
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,311
(glass clanging)
(footsteps approaching)

199
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,062
- Sammy and I have had our walk

200
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,265
and we feel much
  the better for it.

201
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,068
- Good.

202
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,137
- You gonna be long?

203
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,807
- No, I'll just clear up.

204
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:37,676
- Take your time.

205
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,247
I wouldn't want you
 to miss anything.

206
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,888
Uh, you're gonna spend
 the night, aren't ya?

207
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:50,723
I mean,

208
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,394
it's gettin' awful late.

209
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,228
- Okay.

210
00:14:59,164 --> 00:14:59,999
- Yeah.

211
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,537
Good.

212
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,299
(door creaking)

213
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,608
(Oliver heavily breathing)

214
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,307
I wanted to tell ya

215
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,911
that I love you.

216
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,918
I love you very much.

217
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,623
- Go to sleep, Daddy.

218
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,001
At moments, I have
 the egocentric idea

219
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,503
that I love you enough,

220
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,339
intensely and strongly
  enough to hold us together

221
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,409
though we're separated
for so much of the time.

222
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,278
I am torn and harried
 by your absence

223
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,347
and driven by the
loneliness without you.

224
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,017
I continually burn by
  the physical need of you.

225
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,420
(soft music)

226
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,291
But at the same time, you
 are my warmth and my energy

227
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,193
and the goodness
 of the world to me.

228
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,197
I will shamelessly do whatever
 I can to keep you loving me.

229
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,435
- Wow, when did all this go on?

230
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,438
- 1965.

231
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,940
- [Wendy] How old were you?

232
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,309
- About six.

233
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,145
Listen.

234
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,447
Sometimes when I'm most alone,

235
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,216
I fear that the
 memory plays me false

236
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,620
and it could not have been as
 intense and lovely as I think.

237
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,323
But then certain
 overpowering images of you,

238
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,659
of your face
 bending toward mine,

239
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,795
of your body turned to me,

240
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,165
reassure me that it was
  real and it will be again.

241
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,668
My darling, I love you.

242
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,272
It's amazing how much.

243
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,879
(eerie electronic music)

244
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,025
(man humming)

245
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,333
- [Man At Door] Two dollars.

246
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,973
(eerie electronic music)

247
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,351
- Anna, please get
  Ralph back here

248
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,752
as soon as possible
 for that interview.

249
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,254
We're runnin' a
  little over, okay?

250
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,989
- Okay, you know,
  I kinda like it.

251
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,990
- It's interesting, huh?

252
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,925
- Hmm, it's like
four butterflies

253
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,693
tryin' to fly in formation.
 (audience applauding)

254
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,595
- That's very poetic; you don't
mind if I use that do you?

255
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,797
(Anna laughs)

256
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,733
- Yay!
 (audience applauding)

257
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,301
- [Man] Have you ever
seen anything like that?

258
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,302
- [Woman] God, thank you so much

259
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,603
for bringing me here, tonight.

260
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,506
It's really fantastic.
- Excellent, excellent.

261
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,807
Yes.
 - Hi, Oliver.

262
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,975
How are ya?
 - You really should be

263
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,843
proud of yourself.
  - Thank you.

264
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,877
There she is.
 - Hi.

265
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,112
- Hi, muah!

266
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,246
Did ya like it?
  - Are ya kidding?

267
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,514
I loved it.
 - A little feedback.

268
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,815
I heard it, but--
  - Nobody else did.

269
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,617
Did you, Mr. Andrews?
 - Oliver.

270
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,819
- Do you know each other?

271
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,821
- Danny needs you now.
 - Yeah, oh, great.

272
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,924
Muah.
 - You were wonderful.

273
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,926
- Maybe later?
 - Okay, go on.

274
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,095
(footsteps departing)

275
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,532
It's amaze--
 - How long have you--

276
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,234
- (laughs) I'm sorry, go on.

277
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,635
- No, you go on.

278
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,471
- I was just gonna say I
 didn't know you knew Ralph.

279
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,373
- I was just gonna
 say the same thing.

280
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,043
Are you two?

281
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,579
- We're just friends.

282
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,247
He's just excited, that's all.

283
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,316
- Oh, he's really a
 very talented fellow.

284
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,152
- He's a good kid.

285
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,357
- Perhaps you'd like to
have a drink with me?

286
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,292
Maybe we could go to
 some place nearby?

287
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,362
- You don't have to
 feel like ya have to.

288
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,064
- Is that a no?

289
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,167
- (sighs) No, I just don't
  want you to be polite.

290
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,168
- I'm rarely polite.

291
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,404
Would you like to
 have a drink with me?

292
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,240
- I'd love to have
  a drink with you.

293
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,245
- I'm married.

294
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,983
- I figured.

295
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,718
(horn honking)

296
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,518
- Two kids.

297
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,292
Look, I'd just like to tell
 you with no strings attached

298
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,927
that I think you're
 extraordinary.

299
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,432
I do (chuckles) think
 you're extraordinary.

300
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:13,272
No strings.

301
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,774
(car zooming)

302
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,878
(soft music)

303
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,449
- [Joseph] I knew that
what we have together is

304
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,485
by every moral standard wrong,

305
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,055
and yet I find I can
 never give you up.

306
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,993
You say that you're
 worried that there's

307
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,429
not enough that you can give me,

308
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,064
but I'm not asking
  for very much.

309
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,535
Just this, to be
 with you sometimes.

310
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,581
- Thought I lost track of time.

311
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,683
Are you early?

312
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,217
How you doin'?

313
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,285
- I'm fine.
- You look fine.

314
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,554
- Their rinsing.

315
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,056
Andy's gonna watch 'em.

316
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,991
I told 'em no drum drying
  and archival processing

317
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,859
like you said.
 - Right.

318
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,461
- I'll take lunch
 now if that's okay?

319
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,698
- Please, Jake MacLenna,
this is Anna Winter.

320
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,667
- Not the KLAS Anna Winter?
 - Yes (chuckles).

321
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,437
- No kidding, we listen to
 you all the time around here.

322
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,638
- Really?
  - Mm-hmm.

323
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,941
Oh, tell Craig I wanna
 see him before ya go.

324
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,677
I wanna move that truck.
- Move the truck?

325
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,679
But don't you you me to?
- No.

326
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,083
- Oh, right.

327
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,819
It's nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

328
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,653
Bye-bye.

329
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,322
- My office is upstairs.

330
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,323
Why don't you go
  up there and wait.

331
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,125
I'll be up in a minute.
- Okay.

332
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,566
- [Oliver] Need you to move
 that other light up there

333
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,567
a little bit higher.
 - This one here?

334
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,035
Oh, okay.
- Yeah, further.

335
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,969
A little bit more in the corner.

336
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,070
- Okay?
 - Okay, good.

337
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,205
- Okay.
 - Do we have to move

338
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,740
this stuff here?
- There ya go.

339
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,807
- Yeah, yeah.
 - Jake, do me a favor.

340
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,775
- Yeah?
- Put that away.

341
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,878
- All right.

342
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,614

("Contrapunctus 1" by
 Johann Sebastian Bach)

344
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,024
- They're gone.

345
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,962
- You're good.
 - Oh, ancient history.

346
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,798
Look, why don't
 you start on these.

347
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,733
I'm gonna go downstairs
and set up the lights.

348
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,502
I wanna photograph you.

349
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,270
- [Anna] Please, but
 look what I'm wearing.

350
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,105
- Take off your shoes.

351
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,276
Just relax and sit down.

352
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,913
Right there, that's good.

353
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:42,747
Relax.

354
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,788
- I saw that picture
 of you upstairs.

355
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,425
You had long hair.
  - 1971.

356
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,659
I was a lot younger.

357
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,096
How old were you then?

358
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,599
- Eleven.

359
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,568
- Wow.

360
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,444
- You were very handsome.

361
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,180
- I'm sure you
 were adorable, too.

362
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,517
Now, let me look at you.

363
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,291
You still are.

364
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,830
I don't wanna be forward but.

365
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,306
So you're 22?
 - Mm-hmm.

366
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,575
- I'm 40.
  - I know.

367
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,279
- I wanna be honest, I
 can't offer you much.

368
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,781
- I'm not asking for very much.

369
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,250
Just this.

370
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,619
- This?

371
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,089
- To be with you sometimes.

372
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,925
- Oh.

373
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,765
You were 11, huh?
  (Anna laughs)

374
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,769
- Yeah.
 - Hello, KLAS.

375
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,037
(operators chattering)
 (phones ringing)

376
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,238
- [Male Operator]
  Thanks very much.

377
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,172
We appreciate it.
 (operators chattering)

378
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,507
- Okay, two more lines open.

379
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,441
We got eight all ready lit.

380
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,076
Let's match that $100 pledge.

381
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,611
- Come on, if you
 enjoy our programming,

382
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,213
remember, we depend completely
 on your contributions.

383
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,382
We're looking $40,000 worth of

384
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,817
desperately needed
  new equipment.

385
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,687
If you call now with a
donation of $25 or more,

386
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,288
you're entitled
  to one free year--

387
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,023
- I can't think with
 that damn radio on.

388
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,458
- [Anna] In addition,
 our programming guide

389
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,592
will be sent to you--
 - I don't know

390
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,027
what the hell they're
 talkin' about.

391
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,429
- Please remember
  that public radio,

392
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,031
like public TV,
 needs your support.

393
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,299
Come on, one more light,

394
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,534
and we'll go to an
  uninterrupted hour

395
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,169
of Call It Culture
 with Eva Boudelier.

396
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,738
I mean, you should see
our control board, here.

397
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,306
It's literally held
 together with spit and gum.

398
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,240
Isn't it, Danny?

399
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,408
- Chewing gum is a major part

400
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,911
of our operational
budget here, absolutely.

401
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,879
(phone ringing)

402
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,282
Hey, okay, we got to 10.
- Line three.

403
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,051
(operators chatter)
 (phones ringing)

404
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,519
- [Eva] Good afternoon,
this is Eva Boudelier

405
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,354
with Call It Culture.
 - I guess I'll take

406
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,722
this one right here.

407
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,956
- Today, my guest will be--
 - Just bring down

408
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,191
the highlight a little
 bit in the printing.

409
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:06,858
- Jake, would you
 make a note of this?

410
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:07,726
I gotta run.

411
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:15,166
("Contrapunctus 1" by
 Johann Sebastian Bach)

412
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,839
I have to go.

413
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,941
- No.
- (laughs) Yeah.

414
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,610
(lips smacking)

415
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,225
(keys rattling)
(soft music)

416
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,108
(engine revving)

417
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,393
(romantic music)

418
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,063
(waves roaring)

419
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,212
(dramatic romantic music)

420
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,795
- [Karen] I never knew
 it could be like this.

421
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,697
Nobody ever kissed
  me the way you do.

422
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,467
- Nobody?

423
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,968
- No, nobody.

424
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,572
- Look, I don't wanna go home.

425
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,673
Let's do somethin', okay?
  - What ya wanna do?

426
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,174
- I want pinball.

427
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,677
- It's too juvenile.
 - Well, the arcade.

428
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,745
- It's too expensive and you--
 - I'm not goin' to a bar.

429
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:10,615
Where we're gonna get hit,
 I don't wanna deal with it.

430
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,651
(bar patrons softly chattering)

431
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,019
- You wanna break?
  - Yeah.

432
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,089
I shake 'em better than you do.

433
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,593
(Wendy laughs)

434
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,229
(pool ball thudding)

435
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,663
Solids.

436
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,166
- I don't know why I set
 myself up for this punishment.

437
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,602
- Bull excuse me.

438
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,436
Shit.

439
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:38,009
(soft country music)
(bar patrons chattering)

440
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,514
So you haven't told
 me anything yet.

441
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,348
- About what?

442
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,916
- You know what.

443
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,119
- Ooh, whoa.
 - That's all right.

444
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,654
That's all right.
  - All right.

445
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,755
- [Bar Patron] I'm gonna run
 the table on you, actually.

446
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,690
- [Woman] Can I have a beer?

447
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,892
- Is he a good lay?

448
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,227
(pool balls banging)
(Anna annoyingly sighs)

449
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,396
- Thanks a lot.
 - (laughs) You are welcome.

450
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,064
I have some wonderful
 opportunities

451
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,299
on this end of the table.

452
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,935
- As a matter of fact, he is.

453
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,572
- Makes up for the fact
he's married, right?

454
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,943
- No, it doesn't make up for it.

455
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,180
It's complicated.

456
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,215
- He makes you feel?

457
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,617
- He makes me feel.

458
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,856
(pool ball thudding)
 - Fucked?

459
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,160
Look, Anna, the thing that
  ya have to keep in mind

460
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,995
about these kinda relationships

461
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,997
is that if you don't feel
  something for the guy,

462
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,532
you're gonna get out.

463
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,635
And if ya do start feelin'
  somethin', you are fucked.

464
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,338
- I know.

465
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,274
(scoffs) Believe me, I know.

466
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,810
- If he's so great, what if
 you fall in love with him?

467
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,978
That's all I'm asking.

468
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,381
- I guess I'm in big trouble.

469
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,622
(Wendy heavily sighs)
(Anna annoyingly scoffs)

470
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,824
Is this what is known as
 psyching out your opponent?

471
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,392
- Anna, the thing
 you have to remember

472
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,929
is that this guy sleeps with
 someone else every night.

473
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,703
(heavy music)

474
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,706
- [Joseph] The next
 time we are together,

475
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,475
we must talk some
 about your other life,

476
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,310
the life in which
  I have no part.

477
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,915
We must talk about
your husband and child,

478
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,583
Chuck and little Anna.

479
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,352
Help me to picture
  them as people,

480
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,989
to make them real
  for they are real

481
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,592
and I must face that fact.

482
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,968
(Anna pleasurably moaning)

483
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,974
(bed squeaking)

484
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,365
(ducks quacking)

485
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,674
- [Man Outside] Not
 so fast, come here.

486
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,209
- Oh, Ben.
 - Come here.

487
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,277
- What is it?

488
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,714
- [Anna] Ya see those two?

489
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,250
They live out back.

490
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,685
You know, it that beat-up
  place behind the alley?

491
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,320
- I love you.
 - He's a drug dealer.

492
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,121
A lotta people used to come
 and go out of his house.

493
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,323
You know, a lotta women.

494
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,360
So one night, I'm sleeping
 and I heard all these sirens,

495
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,762
and I got all scared and
I ran out in the alley.

496
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,964
Cops were everywhere.

497
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,567
I thought they'd been busted.

498
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,704
- [Oliver] So what happened?

499
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,238
- Turns out she shot him.

500
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,343
They put him in the hospital
 and took her to jail.

501
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,313
Next day, she came out on bail

502
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,449
and came over and
  borrowed my ironing board.

503
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,584
(man softly mumbling)

504
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,585
(ducks quacking)
  - You are welcome.

505
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,292
- I know so little about you.

506
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,064
Do you have any
 pictures of your kids?

507
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,400
- Anna, are you all right?

508
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,769
- I'd like to see 'em.

509
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:26,471
It would help.

510
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,483
- That's Paul.

511
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,317
He's eight.

512
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:41,886
That's Emma.

513
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:43,888
Emma's two.

514
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,860
Does that make it easier?

515
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,498
- They're real now.

516
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,734
They're very beautiful
 (heavily sighs).

517
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,747
Wanna listen to some music?

518
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,855
I'll play you what I was playing

519
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,659
the day I met you at
 the radio station.

520
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,628
It's Chopin, Prelude 15.

521
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:34,539
("Prelude 15" by
Frederic Chopin)

522
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,849
(water splashing)

523
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,169
(dog barking)

524
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,343
- Now, watch your step.
(Anna laughs)

525
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,011
Up,

526
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,845
come on.

527
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:21,078
(waves gently splashing)

528
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,900
(keys rattling)

529
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,008
Well, you better
 brush that sand off.

530
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,510
It'd be sorta hard to explain.

531
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,720
(horn honking)

532
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,355
(phone ringing)

533
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,824
- KLAS, may I help you?
- Thank you very much.

534
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,492
- KLAS, how may I help you?
 - You have to get

535
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,727
their name and address.

536
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,262
And you have to make
 sure if they bank note

537
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,231
that you get it and
 the expiration date.

538
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,199
Your initials go there and
  then the time and date,

539
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,068
and then you have
  to ask the donor

540
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,571
if he or she is willing to
 let us credit the money here.

541
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,075
'Kay, goes there.
  (phones ringing)

542
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,876
And that's it.

543
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:30,881
Pick it up.
 (operators chattering)

544
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,285
(crickets chirping)

545
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,030
(hand knocking)

546
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,768
Hey, Daddy.
 - Well, look at you.

547
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,238
What's this?
 - Some wine.

548
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,607
- Wine, my date brought wine?

549
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,743
Hey, this is a pretty
 classy deal here.

550
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,612
- [Man On TV] That it was
  impossible for anybody.

551
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,816
- Ya sure there's
  nothing I can do?

552
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,185
- (laughs) What
  are ya kiddin' me?

553
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,956
You just sit right there;
  you're the guest of honor.

554
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,928
Surprised at your ol' man, huh?

555
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,196
Didn't know I could cook.

556
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,632
- I've had your steaks.

557
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:24,435
- Yeah.

558
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,972
Well, actually the
  rice is nothin'.

559
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,177
Everything these days
comes in a plastic bag.

560
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,279
Put it in a pot, ya
 bring it to a boil.

561
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,114
Bingo, ya got it.

562
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,551
Of course, ya have to flip
  it every 15 minutes or so,

563
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,687
otherwise, it doesn't
 heat thoroughly.

564
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,489
Well, it doesn't heat
 evenly all the way through.

565
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,590
- Well, it looks good.

566
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,493
- Yeah?

567
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,863
Well, it's nothin' fancy.

568
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,099
It's not like your
 mother used to make,

569
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,968
but she was a real cook.

570
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,771
I'm doin' all right.

571
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,341
And I have a woman
 once a week to clean.

572
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,646
Older woman comes in.

573
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,783
Other than that, I pretty
  much take care of myself.

574
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,788
- I'm impressed.
- Whoa!

575
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,991
I want to propose a toast.

576
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,596
To us.
(clock chiming)

577
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,238
It is good.

578
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,206
(laughs) It's good.

579
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,681
And another thing
  about Orientals

580
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,184
is that they are
  born shopkeepers.

581
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,353
Hey, they are real businessmen.

582
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,158
And they're everywhere,
look around.

583
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,461
You can't swing a cat without
 knockin' into one of 'em.

584
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,597
They're smart.

585
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,900
Okay, they recognized
 my abilities,

586
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,236
so they keep me on.

587
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:09,140
- I gotta go, Daddy.
 - Go, schmo.

588
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,475
Sit here and talk to me, please.

589
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,179
Look at you.

590
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,484
My little girl, a professional.

591
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,989
- I earn $225 a week.

592
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,658
- Hey, it's not the money.

593
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,594
You are a professional,
that's the point.

594
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,863
And don't you forget it.

595
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,167
Your mother was
 very proud of that.

596
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:40,838
- I miss her.

597
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,075
- What's that?

598
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,277
- I said I miss her.

599
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,413
- Yeah, well, we all miss her.

600
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,683
She's a wonderful woman.

601
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,954
I was never good enough for her.

602
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,022
Not near good enough.

603
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,325
Hey, forget it.

604
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,560
It doesn't matter.

605
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,095
It's water under the
 bridge, isn't it?

606
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,437
We never talked like
 this before, did we?

607
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,708
I mean, just you and
 I sittin' and talkin'.

608
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,844
- No.
- Well, we will.

609
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,947
It's important to me.

610
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,752
Your mother expected
 a lot, you know?

611
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,256
Hey, I'm not sayin'
 she didn't deserve it.

612
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,525
God knows she
 deserved it, I just...

613
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,928
It isn't a case of that.

614
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,830
- I gotta go, Daddy.
 - Wait a minute.

615
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,833
Ya got a boyfriend, Anna?

616
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,070
- Yes.

617
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,307
- He gonna marry ya?

618
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,110
- Maybe.

619
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,046
- Not in a hurry, huh?

620
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,548
That's good.

621
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,316
Your mother and I
  were in a hurry.

622
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,954
Of course, it's different times

623
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,556
and our little secret.

624
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,761
- I know you married Mama
'cause she was pregnant, Daddy.

625
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,595
She told me.

626
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,300
- No.

627
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,570
I married her
 because I loved her.

628
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,240
And she was beautiful.

629
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,175
Like you.

630
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,746
Listen, don't be
 afraid of me, honey.

631
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,016
I know I'm not gonna
 be any problem to ya.

632
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,684
You can see that,
  I can take care.

633
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,885
Wait a second, sit down!

634
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,520
Where the hell
  are ya goin', now?

635
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,055
What did I do, did I touch ya?

636
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,889
Is that the problem?

637
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,990
- Leave me alone!

638
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,294
(intense music)

639
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,862
- Oh, God, you're like her.

640
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:52,102
(heavily sighs) You
 are so like her.

641
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:53,637
(Chuck softly sobs)

642
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,874
- I'm gonna wash the dishes
 and then I'm gonna leave.

643
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,177
(intense music)

644
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,378
- I'm sorry, honey.

645
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,250
What do ya think about
 a man like me, huh?

646
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,419
- I think you should go to bed.

647
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,223
- Leave the goddamn dishes!

648
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,893
Go on!
 (hurried footsteps)

649
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,695
Go on, you...

650
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,531
The most important thing in
 life is not a roll in the hay!

651
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,634
You understand me?
  (door bangs)

652
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,741
(suspenseful music)

653
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,841
(change rattling)

654
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,979
(phone rings)

655
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,316
- [Edith] Hello?

656
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:14,852
Hello?

657
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,521
Who is this?

658
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:19,590
Hello?

659
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:22,693
- Wrong number.

660
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,945
(water softly splashing)

661
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:46,550
It's beautiful.

662
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,586
- So are you.

663
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,856
(lips smacking)

664
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,491
Go get your coat.
  - Okay.

665
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,367
- She looks very nice.

666
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,005
I'm sorry.

667
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,708
I had to make her real, too.

("Contrapunctus 1" by

669
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,406
- [Joseph] My darling,

670
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,643
I'm home again and the
  memory of our last meeting

671
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,712
is fresh in my mind.

672
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:28,018
Nothing and no one can take
from me what we found together.

673
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,391
Together, we're more than
  the sum of our parts.

674
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,130
Can I sacrifice this even
  in my own best interest?

675
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,834
Not if I love you as
 indeed I do love you.

676
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,503
Maggie, my own, forever.

("Contrapunctus 1" by
 Johann Sebastian Bach)

678
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,568
- [Edith] Come on, Emma.

679
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,003
Can you get it, Emma?

680
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,406
Emma, here it comes.

681
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,541
Okay, I'm gonna try this.

682
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,476
Emma.
  - Mommy, I have to

683
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,378
throw the ball.
- Oh, okay.

684
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,548
Okay, golly (laughs)!

685
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,917
Okay.

686
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,427
- Hi, Anna Winter?
  - Yes.

687
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,163
- Marcia Newell,
 KBFK San Francisco.

688
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,332
- Hi.
  - I was expecting someone

689
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,233
a little older.

690
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,704
So what do you think about it?

691
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,340
- Yeah, I think it's
 a great opportunity.

692
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,508
- [Marcia] I think you're right.

693
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,478
- You know it's funny, KBFK
 used to be my dream station.

694
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,013
- It's a good station.

695
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,181
- It's a great station.

696
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,684
- We have 10 times
 the audience of KLAS;

697
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,055
10 times, maybe 20
 times the subscribers.

698
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,424
There's a real future for you.

699
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,560
- I know.

700
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,062
- You wanna talk about it?

701
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,165
- San Francisco's
  a long way away.

702
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,334
I mean, it's 400 miles, right?

703
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:28,005
- It's an hour's flight,
so what's the problem?

704
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,074
- It's sort of personal.

705
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:33,810
- I see.

706
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,649
- Have you listened
 to Danny De Fronso?

707
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,950
I mean, he's so good.

708
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,119
- I've listened to Danny.

709
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:42,953
You're better.

710
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:49,393
Look, Anna, sometimes when
  an opportunity gets away,

711
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,761
they don't come again.

712
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,865
You're young, maybe it
 doesn't seem that way to you.

713
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,035
- No, it seems that way to me.

714
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,339
- Well, just think about it.

715
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,607
- Okay, thanks.

716
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,346
(heavy music)

717
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,823
- [Joseph] I'm sick of my life

718
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,259
with its intolerable
 contradictions.

719
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:29,299
My mind keeps warning me that
 love, even as we know it,

720
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,703
must be lived in the
 everyday world of

721
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,641
Chevrolets and toothaches
  and lost chances.

722
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,414
- Stay very still.
  (Anna giggles)

723
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:49,419
(camera clicking)
  (film screeching)

724
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,863
We can do better, I
 think it's too hot.

725
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,765
- That's your fault.
 (Oliver laughs)

726
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,799
- [Oliver] I doubt that.

727
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,535
Okay, look down here.

728
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:10,540
(lovers giggling)
  (camera clicking)

729
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,409
Probably too much movement.

730
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,985
Shift your body.

731
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,353
No, too much tit.

732
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,055
Good, good, good!

733
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,123
That's good, okay.

734
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,792
(camera clicks)

735
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,563
- [Anna] That's enough.

736
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,834
- [Oliver] Just let me see
 this one; 10, 11, 12, okay.

737
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,506
- [Anna] Are we finished?

738
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,141
- [Oliver] Just one more.

739
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,208
Look up here.

740
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,445
You look so sad.

741
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,314
What is it?
(camera clicks)

742
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,787
- [Anna] Take off
  your wedding ring.

743
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,122
Just for an hour.

744
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,425
- I'm sorry.

745
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,965
(jazz music)

746
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:09,800
Morgan!

747
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,572
Morgan.
- How ya doin'?

748
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,107
- Good.

749
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,542
Anna, I'd like ya to
 meet Morgan Crawford,

750
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,943
famous American artist.

751
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,946
Morgan, this is Anna
 Winters, famous American DJ.

752
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:26,750
- How charming, hmm.
 (lips smacking)

753
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,084
- [Oliver] So how was Amsterdam?

754
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:28,952
- Wonderful.

755
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,088
In the winter, it doesn't smell.

756
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:35,125
- Good.
(Morgan smirks)

757
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,060
- Hmm, not properly chilled.

758
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,730
- Don't you pick on her.

759
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,698
I'll be right back.

760
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:49,106
(soft piano music)
 (patrons chattering)

761
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,075
- He seemed very happy.

762
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,246
You're responsible
 for that, aren't you?

763
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,881
- I don't know, am I?

764
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,452
- No doubt, you'll be good
  for his work, as well.

765
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,490
Contradiction and irony
  are two different things.

766
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,924
- [Oliver] Look, you're just
 trying to change the subject

767
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,793
because you know I'm
 right and, of course,

768
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,962
irony and contradiction
  are two different things.

769
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,864
- [Morgan] What's
 the difference then?

770
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,932
- Contradiction is
 a statement of fact

771
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,168
and irony is a way of
 dealing with the fact.

772
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,904
- Contradiction is
objective irony subject.

773
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,138
What would you
  say the difference

774
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,874
between contradiction
 and irony is, Anna?

775
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,010
- I don't know, I'd
 probably have to

776
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,445
look it up in the dictionary.

777
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,815
- Doesn't know the game.

778
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,683
- Anna, the point
 is to figure it out.

779
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:34,918
Not to look it up
  in a dictionary.

780
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,521
You know, conversation.

781
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,189
- Irony has humor in it.

782
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,423
- No, no, no, no.

783
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,125
Contradiction might be
funny, but irony never.

784
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,693
- Never, no.

785
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,695
Irony is deadly serious.

786
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,963
I have it.

787
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,666
If contradiction is weather,

788
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,835
then irony is umbrellas.

789
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,603
- Very good!

790
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,105
But not quite.

791
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,574
Irony is stealing the umbrellas.

792
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,010
- Oh.
  (Morgan chuckles)

793
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,478
- Oh, by the way, I
 have something here

794
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,013
that belongs to Edith.

795
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,814
Would you mind
 returning this for me?

796
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,350
I'd do it myself, but I'm
 flying off to Munich tomorrow.

797
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,187
That first essay is a straight
 ripoff of Walter Benjamin's

798
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,156
Works of Art in the Age of
  Mechanical Reproduction,

799
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,425
but the essay on
  nudes is terrific.

800
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,359
- [Oliver] You've read
 what he has to say

801
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,827
about photography, haven't you?

802
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,762
It's fascinating.

803
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,463
It completely refutes Sontag.

804
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:25,468
("Contrapunctus 1" by
 Johann Sebastian Bach)

805
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,513
- You know what he told me?

806
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,847
He said I was good for you.

807
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,284
- He was jealous as hell.

808
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,820
He was green (laughs).

809
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,003
Jesus, get down!

810
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,474
(footsteps departing)

811
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:07,611
Okay, get up.

812
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,879
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

813
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,314
Those people work with Edith.

814
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,450
Goddamn it!

815
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,687
(engine revving)

816
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,692
- Come on.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

817
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,328
Let's go in the living
  room and sit for a minute.

818
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,430
- You never wanted to
 sit in there before.

819
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,265
- Well, I do tonight.

820
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,567
I got plenty of time.

821
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,002
Edith is at a lecture
 until 11 o'clock--

822
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,604
- I don't wanna
  know where she is.

823
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,008
- Okay, but I just wanna
go in the living room.

824
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,476
Sit.

825
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,310
Talk.

826
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:46,750
- Okay.

827
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,432
- They had a hell of a
time getting it in here.

828
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,473
Try it.

829
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,076
I've never heard you play.

830
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,746
- [Anna] I'm not very good.

831
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,851
("Prelude 15" by Chopin)

832
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,370
(intense music)

833
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,990
- [Edith] Emma, Emma
 honey, wait for me.

834
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,564
(engine rumbling)

835
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,021
- [Emma] Can I go up there?

836
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:10,059
I wanna ride the blue horse.

837
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,265
- [Edith] Oh, here we go.

838
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,638
- [Emma] I wanna pretend
to be in the air.

839
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:22,939
Higher, Mommy.

840
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,607
Higher, Mommy.
 - You ridin' with a saddles.

841
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,142
- [Emma] Higher, Mommy.

842
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,478
- [Edith] That's not a test.

843
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,598
(suspenseful music)

844
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,940
(swing creaking)

845
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:00,977
- Oh, I'm tellin' ya.

846
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,579
San Francisco is
totally amazing.

847
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,681
It's a very, very exciting city.

848
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,549
Well, I'm sort of
  semi-managing this group.

849
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:07,483
You're gonna hear from them.

850
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,285
They're called Little Claw.

851
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,688
Modernistic with classical
  overtones, you know?

852
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:12,889
- It's great to
 see ya back though.

853
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:13,723
- Hey, thank you.

854
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,158
It's great to be back.

855
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,659
God, you all look incredible.

856
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,827
Nothing's changed around here.

857
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,896
You still have the
same crummy ol' coffee.

858
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,299
Hey!

859
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:24,133
- Hey.

860
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,405
You look great.

861
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,210
- You do.
  - What was it called, the?

862
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,044
- I got a show.

863
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,112
I'll see ya later, okay?

864
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,715
- [Male Employee] Look, why
 don't we check this guy out

865
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,016
just to convince us all.
(woman giggles)

866
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:40,850
Well, look at the schedule.

867
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,684
I think that if we.

868
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,520
(classical music)

869
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,327
- Hey.

870
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,396
- Hey.

871
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,099
(lips smacking)

872
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,967
- [Danny] Hmm.

873
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:58,801
- I know.

874
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:02,872
- You look tired.

875
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,073
- Partied all night.

876
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,542
- So how's it goin'?

877
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,513
- It's okay, it's
  about the same.

878
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,483
- I heard there've been
some big cutbacks here.

879
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,484
They cut your hours?

880
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,520
- I'm fine.

881
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,760
(Anna anxiously laughs)

882
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,662
So how's it going
  with you up there?

883
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,297
- Forget it, incredible.

884
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,802
Incredible, the people in San
 Francisco are so wonderful.

885
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,139
Not only that, they're totally
 open to my kinda programming

886
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,007
and your kinda programming.

887
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:38,808
- Great.

888
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,679
- And I think you oughta
  come up and check it out.

889
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,714
- I will.

890
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,316
- Not only that, but truly,

891
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,119
the real reason that I came here

892
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,623
was because I wanted
 to say thank you

893
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,491
'cause I know what you did.

894
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,694
- I didn't do anything.

895
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,762
You got it on your
 own, you know that.

896
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,730
- Yeah, right.

897
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,034
Well, anyway--
 - Anyway.

898
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,637
(Anna laughs)

899
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,839
What do you wanna hear
 for the ride home?

900
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,107
- Oh, right.

901
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:11,941
Little Richard.

902
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,278
- This is Obsessions in Music.

903
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,847
- So what, it's
 gotta be classical?

904
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,681
Hey!

905
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,783
- I guess I could get obsessed

906
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,352
with a little Richard for once.

907
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,120
- Anna.

908
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,458
You're the greatest.

909
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:30,893
- Bye.

910
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,201
(door softly bangs)

911
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,475
- [Female Neighbor] No, Ben!

912
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,443
I've got no place to go!

913
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,312
- [Ben] What the fuck?

914
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,513
About the drugs?

915
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,382
I'm tired of you
 lookin' into my life!

916
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,616
Leave me alone!
 - Please don't, Ben.

917
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,151
- [Ben] You've been
fuckin' up around here.

918
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,986
I don't need you anymore!
  (woman shouting)

919
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,454
- Ben, Ben!
 (door bangs)

920
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,390
No, let me back in, Ben!

921
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:02,392
Stop!

922
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,626
Ben!

923
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,461
- [Ben] Shut up and get
the hell out of here!

924
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,863
- Ben, let me in!

925
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:09,599
Ben!

926
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,235
Ben, let me in!

927
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,638
Ben!
- You got no money, huh?

928
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,472
You got no money?

929
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:17,306
You want money!

930
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,541
You want money!

931
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,143
Pick it up, pick
  it up, pick it up!

932
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,377
Go ahead, pick it up!

933
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:22,678
Pick it all up!
  - Ben, I love you!

934
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:23,846
- Get the fuck outta here!

935
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,648
Make it on your own!
 - I love you!

936
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,717
I love you (sobbing)!

937
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,453
(intense music)
I love you, Ben.

938
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,788
I love you, Ben!

939
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,629
(phone rings)

940
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:46,102
- Hello?

941
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,637
- [Oliver] It's me.

942
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,273
- Are you calling from home?

943
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,841
- [Oliver] I had to.

944
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,076
Listen, I know I said I'd
  be by this morning, but I.

945
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:56,112
- You can't?

946
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:56,913
- [Oliver] No.

947
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,483
- I see.
 - It's not my fault.

948
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,152
I can't talk now.

949
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,221
Are you all right?

950
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,789
- What difference does it make?

951
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,826
- [Oliver] Just for
 five minutes, okay?

952
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,928
I'll be there in a half an hour.

953
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,830
I won't come if
 you're gonna be angry.

954
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,630
- I won't.

955
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,233
Please come.

956
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:19,869
I miss you.

957
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:25,174
(vocalized singing)

958
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,844
(hand knocking)

959
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:33,983
Hi.

960
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,287
I missed you.

961
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,493
(lips smacking)
- Yeah, me, too.

962
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,328
- Come on.
 - Anna, I...

963
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:47,530
Anna, please, darling.

964
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,764
- [Anna] I've been missing you.

965
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:50,199
- [Oliver] I don't
 have time for this.

966
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,467
- We can hurry.

967
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,035
- Anna, I don't have
 time to (mumbles).

968
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,003
No, sweetheart.

969
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,371
Anna, no.

970
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,372
Anna, no.

971
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,173
God, Anna.

972
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:58,908
No.

973
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,278
- Why not?

974
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,112
- Oh, god.

975
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,783
Anna, I just made
  love with my wife.

976
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,901
(door bangs)

977
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,645
(Anna sobbing)

978
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:39,849
Anna.

979
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,187
Anna, this is crazy.

980
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,155
Would you please open the door?

981
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,558
(door rattling)

982
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,992
Anna!

983
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,460
Anna, open the door.

984
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,163
Anna, Anna!
 (door banging)

985
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,802
Sweetheart.
 (Anna sobbing)

986
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,537
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

987
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,006
I'm so sorry.

988
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,576
It's all right, it's all right.

989
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,518
We've got a whole
history together, Anna.

990
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,453
I spent 15 years of
 my life with her.

991
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,656
That's almost half my life.

992
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,229
Hasn't always been great but

993
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,200
I got two kids I love very much.

994
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,039
She's a very decent,

995
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,442
kind,

996
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,877
loving--

997
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:43,246
- Do you want me to tell
ya 'bout my boyfriends

998
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,114
and about how good
 and decent and loving

999
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,116
and good in bed they were?

1000
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:49,518
- I'm sure they were.

1001
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:54,757
- They weren't.

1002
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,397
There's never been anybody.

1003
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,770
Why couldn't you just lie to me?

1004
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:11,507
Why couldn't you
  just lie and say,

1005
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,676
Anna, I don't love her.

1006
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,213
Would it be so hard?

1007
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,518
- It's not fair, is it?

1008
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,555
- I think you should leave.

1009
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,897
It's just not easy anymore.

1010
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,100
- Do you really think
it's any easier for me?

1011
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,001
- I'm second best.

1012
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,704
It's not the way I want it,
 it's the way you want it.

1013
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:42,838
You wrote the rules.

1014
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:45,274
- Anna, I'm afraid
 it's just a little bit

1015
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,843
more complicated than that.

1016
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,945
You and I don't have
 any children together.

1017
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:53,015
- It has nothing to
 do with children!

1018
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,283
It has to do with her!

1019
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,452
You want all of her and
just a little bit of me!

1020
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,288
- You want me to
leave my family.

1021
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:03,025
- No, I want you to
 want to leave them.

1022
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:06,329
I want you to want to leave
 her because ya hate her guts

1023
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,398
and 'cause you love me.

1024
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:14,904
I want you to want me.

1025
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:18,574
At any cost, I'll take guilt.

1026
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:20,876
I'll take anything.

1027
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,213
I just want you to want me.

1028
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,049
- Come here.

1029
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:28,951
- No.

1030
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:31,654
- Come here.
 - No.

1031
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,123
- Say it.
  - No!

1032
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,559
I hate you.
 - You don't hate me.

1033
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,393
Say it.

1034
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,162
Say it.
- No.

1035
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,832
Not unless you think
 I'm the smartest

1036
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,767
and most beautiful and
  sexiest girl you ever saw.

1037
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,435
- You are the sexiest.

1038
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,571
You are the most beautiful.

1039
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,239
(lips smacking)

1040
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,340
Say it.
- No!

1041
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,242
- Say it!
  - No!

1042
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,410
- Say it.
  - No.

1043
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:58,581
(Anna gasping)

1044
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,050
- Say it.
  - No.

1045
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,986
- [Oliver] Say it.

1046
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,590
(Anna moaning)

1047
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:11,594
- I love you.

1048
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:12,495
I love you.

1049
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,069
(lips smacking)

1050
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:25,074
(intense music)

1051
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:34,850
I am sick

1052
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,019
of my life.

1053
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,063
And it's intolerable
 contradictions.

1054
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,571
(intense music)

1055
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,375
- [Joseph] My mind keeps
warning me that love,

1056
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,143
even as we know it.

1057
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,678
- Must be lived

1058
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,147
in the everyday world

1059
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,483
of Chevrolets

1060
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:13,222
(suspenseful music)
 and toothaches

1061
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,063
and lost chances.

1062
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,801
I am torn and harried
 by your absence.

1063
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,336
Driven by the
 loneliness without you

1064
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,706
and continually burned by
  the physical need of you.

1065
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,882
I can no longer bear
 to keep seeing you

1066
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,017
if there's no way that
 you'll ever be mine.

1067
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,988
I want you now for
 my own and forever.

1068
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,223
(intense music)

1069
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,792
Sometimes it's right
 to do the wrong thing.

1070
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,726
Be mine, darling.

1071
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,495
Be brave.

1072
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,131
I love you.

1073
01:08:56,131 --> 01:08:57,633
It's amazing how much.

1074
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:00,536
(soft piano music)

1075
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,157
(door creaking)

1076
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,227
- Hey, Anna!

1077
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,852
(paper rifling)

1078
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:57,893
(hand knocking)

1079
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,128
Hey, kiddo.

1080
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,296
What ya doin'?

1081
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,865
- You know Chesley?

1082
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,167
Joseph Chesley?

1083
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,772
He made a terrible mistake.

1084
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,507
- Yeah, right, who's Chesley?

1085
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,143
- He wrote the letters.

1086
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,178
- Yeah.

1087
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,947
No, you know, I kinda
 forgot about him.

1088
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,382
- You know, my mother was weak?

1089
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:25,387
You know, she couldn't
  take care of her own life.

1090
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,089
He had to and he didn't.

1091
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,658
He had to force her.

1092
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,029
They were so much in love.

1093
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,364
(intense music)

1094
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,165
You know?

1095
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:38,500
It's so rare.

1096
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,837
See, he thought he was
 saving three lives,

1097
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:42,671
but he didn't.

1098
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,707
He ruined three lives.

1099
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,542
He ruined his and my mother's--

1100
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,710
- And your father's.

1101
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:50,846
- Yeah, his too.

1102
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,751
Sometimes it's right to
  do the wrong thing though.

1103
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,254
Isn't it?
  - Oh, Anna, I don't know.

1104
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:00,789
- He had to make her see.

1105
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,325
He had to take her.
 - Look, Anna.

1106
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,727
I don't know what difference
 this makes, all right?

1107
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,229
- It makes all the difference.

1108
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,102
You don't understand, do you?

1109
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,336
- I don't know.

1110
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,773
Yeah, okay, maybe.

1111
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,577
- He wrote such
  beautiful letters.

1112
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,512
Just beautiful letters.

1113
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,415
I wish I knew him.

1114
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,685
You know, just to know him.

1115
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,353
(intense music)

1116
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,355
I mean, they were
  just beautiful.

1117
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,190
Don't ya think so?

1118
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,926
- Anna, I think I'm getting
 really worried about you.

1119
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,663
- Don't be worried about me.

1120
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:41,497
I'm okay.

1121
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:43,632
I'm great.

1122
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,436
I know what to do.

1123
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,776
I finally know what to do.

1124
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:00,015
(suspenseful music)

1125
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,735
(tires screeching)

1126
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,365
- [Edith] Come on,
  let's go to bed.

1127
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,599
- [Paul] Mom, I haven't
finished this yet.

1128
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,035
- You can finish
  it tomorrow, okay?

1129
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,803
- Okay.
- Gimme a kiss.

1130
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:55,804
- [Paul] Goodnight, Dad.

1131
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,439
- I love you.
(lips smacking)

1132
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,375
- Bed now.
(lips smacking)

1133
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,644
Guess who wants to do the
elevator one more time (laughs).

1134
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,514
- [Oliver] I can't guess.

1135
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,616
Here we go, first floor.

1136
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,284
There's the second floor,

1137
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,453
to the third,
(Emma giggling)

1138
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,921
and fourth floor.

1139
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,457
- Ready, oh, goin' down!
(Emma laughs)

1140
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:19,762
- To the basement (laughs).
 (Oliver laughs)

1141
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,497
- Come up soon, okay?

1142
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:27,436
(lips smacking)
(intense music)

1143
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,739
- Darling, why don't
you take her up to bed.

1144
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,040
- Okay.

1145
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,410
You'll come up soon?
 - Yeah.

1146
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,345
- Come on, hun, let's go to bed.

1147
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,446
Say nite-nite.

1148
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,047
- [Emma] Nite-nite.

1149
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,728
(hurried footsteps)

1150
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,062
- [Oliver] Anna!

1151
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,101
(glass shattering)

1152
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,102
Anna!

1153
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:00,969
- Let go of me!
- Wait, Anna.

1154
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,538
- Leave me alone.

1155
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,139
Get your goddamn hands off me!

1156
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,507
I said let go of me!
 - What is the matter with you?

1157
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:06,708
Have you gone crazy?
- Maybe I should talk to

1158
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,177
your wife.
 - Anna, now, I'm begin' you--

1159
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:08,977
- Maybe she'd like to know
 what the fuck you been doin'!

1160
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,479
- [Oliver] Please don't!

1161
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,280
- [Anna] Maybe she'd like to
 know where you been at night?

1162
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,048
- What's Daddy doing?

1163
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,484
- What do you think I am?
  - Please.

1164
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:16,718
- A fuck machine?
 - No, I don't, Anna.

1165
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:19,555
- Turn me on, turn me off!
  - Anna!

1166
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:20,722
- My letter, you didn't
even answer my letter.

1167
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:21,890
- I did, too; I've
been thinking about it.

1168
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,025
That's all.
- Oh, bullshit.

1169
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,459
- No, it frightened me.

1170
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:25,828
You frightened me; it
 didn't even sound like you.

1171
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,629
Anna, why are you
  doing this to me?

1172
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,931
I have always been
  honest with you.

1173
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,032
(Anna angrily mumbling)

1174
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,300
Anna!

1175
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,634
Oh, my god.

1176
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,203
Anna?

1177
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,037
Anna?

1178
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:39,107
(intense music)

1179
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,802
(soft music)

1180
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,717
- [Emma] Paul.

1181
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:22,551
Come here.

1182
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:24,620
- [Paul] Shh.

1183
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,167
(door creaking)

1184
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,623
- [Edith] Did ya
call the doctor?

1185
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:02,891
What did he say?

1186
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,660
- [Oliver] He says
  he's on his way.

1187
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,062
- [Edith] Stop it,
  don't touch me.

1188
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:09,264
- [Oliver] Edith,
 please, for Christ.

1189
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,199
- [Edith] Just answer
 me one question.

1190
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,467
What is it that I do

1191
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,236
that would make you
 wanna do this to me?

1192
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,571
- [Oliver] (sighs) Edith,
  you didn't do a thing.

1193
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,140
Please, look at me.

1194
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,143
- [Edith] She's very
 young, isn't she?

1195
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,144
You bastard.

1196
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,147
- [Oliver] I don't know
what to say, Edith.

1197
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,950
Honestly, I don't know
 what to say to you.

1198
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,251
- [Edith] Do you love her?

1199
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,854
- [Oliver] It's
  possible, but I love you.

1200
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,223
- I'm never gonna be able
  to believe that again.

1201
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,492
I really believed
  that you loved me.

1202
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,761
And if not me, I knew
you loved the children.

1203
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,829
- Just give me a chance, Edith.

1204
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,064
Give me.

1205
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,231
- I can't believe it.

1206
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,206
- I'm sorry.

1207
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,624
(footsteps departing)

1208
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,461
- [Oliver] Anna, Anna, wait.

1209
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,328
Look, you can't drive
 home alone like this.

1210
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:14,296
- [Anna] I'm fine.

1211
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,464
- Anna, please listen.

1212
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,298
Wait!
  - I said I'm fine!

1213
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,299
- Please, listen to me!

1214
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,001
I got to tell ya something!

1215
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:20,635
I don't want it
  to end like this.

1216
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,905
I just can't walk out on 'em.

1217
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,574
I have to hurt
  the fewest people.

1218
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,708
Do you understand me?

1219
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:29,411
- You love her.

1220
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:31,713
- Yes, of course, I love her.

1221
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,415
I always have, I love you, too.

1222
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,251
- I don't think ya did.

1223
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,619
- Anna, you're very young.

1224
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:39,788
You're very special.

1225
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,289
You can do a hell of
 a lot better than me,

1226
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,157
a hell of a lot.

1227
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,960
- Will I really?
- Yeah.

1228
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,063
Anna, if there is one
  thing I've learned in life

1229
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,565
it's that everything
 passes, everything.

1230
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,437
It's gonna be all right.

1231
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,738
Just tell me it's
 gonna be all right.

1232
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:57,773
Please, Anna.

1233
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,509
Say it's gonna be all right.

1234
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:09,117
- Goodbye.

(engine rumbles)

1237
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,462

01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,097
- [Chuck] Goddamn it, you!

1239

- [Maggie] You're
 drunk, leave me alone!

1240
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:58,133
Don't touch me.

1241
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,136
If you don't care about
me, think about Anna!

1242
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,671
- [Chuck] Did I touch
ya, is that the problem?

1243
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,140
I'll never touch you again!
 - Get off, I'm leaving!

1244
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,608
- [Chuck] No, you're not.

1245
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,409
You're not going anywhere!
 - If you don't care about me,

1246
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,343
think about Anna.

1247

Please, she's your daughter!

1248
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:10,846
Just leave me alone!
 - What did I do?

1249
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,447
Did I touch ya, is
  that the problem?

1250
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,815
I'll never touch ya again!

1251
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:14,716
Don't you move!

1252
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:18,320

1253

1262
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,213
The gardenias?

1265

("Contrapunctus 1" by

1267
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,233
- When did you see her last?

1268
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,034
- Oh,

1269
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,804
five years ago,

1270
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:56,871
just for a few hours.

1271
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,776
And before that,
  another 10 years.

1272
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,013
- That's a long time.

1273
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:06,614
- Yes, a long time.

1274
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:14,923
- Should've been together.

1275
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,126
- Worst mistake.

1276
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:21,763
She was my chance.

1277
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:25,867
I lost her.

1278
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:30,505
- I have something of yours.

1279
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:42,283
She gave it to me but I
  think you should have it.

1280
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,289
- Kept it all these years.

1281
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:54,162
- [Anna] Here.

1282
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,001
- Damn it.

1283
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,738
It really is embarrassing.

1284
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,983
She was the love
 of my life, ya see?

1285
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:18,653
You understand.

1286
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:25,760
Maybe you've been
 loved the way we were.

1287

- No.
