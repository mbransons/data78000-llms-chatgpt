1
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:44,394
There was a bunch of pigs right here.

2
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:51,406
Gosh, this looks like a junkyard.

3
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:56,035
Well, there's your mother.

4
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,737
Robert, you're a coward.

5
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,783
You're disgusting.

6
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,783
And you make me sick the way
you're hiding behind my baby!

7
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,162
This is not a baby!
This is Renee, she's my friend...

8
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:08,923
Yeah and I'm not a maid!

9
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:13,800
They're taking over the house,
cigarettes,

10
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,007
all the booze.

11
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,265
They're using the silver.

12
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,227
Put me down you turkey sandwich.

13
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,992
- Thanks for bringing my car back.
- Oh, you're welcome.

14
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm Robert Harmon.

15
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,698
Hi, I'm Laurie.

16
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:40,572
They're in your bathroom.

17
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,362
They've got the jewerly
all over, the makeup.

18
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,746
They take baths whenever they want to.

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,703
Hi, garbage lady!

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,544
I'm Phyllis.

21
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:52,423
- Stop trying to organize me, okay!
- I'm not trying to organize you, i'm...

22
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:00,136
This place looks like it's going
to take three days to clean up.

23
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:03,473
- I'm Robert Harmon.
- Hi. Joanie.

24
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:06,345
You're a beautiful girl, Joanie.

25
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,812
Do me a favor, will ya kids? When you're
finished doing what you're doing, just clean it up.

26
00:02:11,027 --> 00:02:14,728
Because I only have a secretary,
and she's a little annoyed right now, okay.

27
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:18,947
I'm Robert Harmon.

28
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:24,581
You're drinking champagne, that's nice.
So, just finish it up, and...

29
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,961
Oh, Hi, you must be Mr. Harmon.

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,058
I'm sorry, just having fun,
just playing you know.

31
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,849
There wasn't enough hot water.

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,898
Joanie's gonna sing

33
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,240
or recite.

34
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:06,744
This is champagne, that's orange juice,
make a little marmosa.

35
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,167
Hurry up, like that,
cuz we don't want to hold her up.

36
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:13,289
Just pour yourself something.

37
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,417
Put a lil "Champs-ElysÃ©es" in it.

38
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,395
You sell?

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,059
What?

40
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:32,095
Anything.

41
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,269
You sell love,

42
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:39,480
you sell drugs,
you sell poetry,

43
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:42,155
whatever.  What do you sell?

44
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,369
- How old are you?
- 18.

45
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,987
18, that's what you said.

46
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,082
18 ...

47
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:53,040
You dance?

48
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,214
Charlene tells me you sing.

49
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,253
Yeah, I try.

50
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,881
What do you sing?

51
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:05,845
I write poetry
and I sing it.

52
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:10,681
Why don't you sing it?
I mean, you don't have to sing it.

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,313
You could recite it.

54
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,068
Just say it.

55
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:24,398
And don't look away, will you please,
because i'm going to record you.

56
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,154
What are you doing,
I don't know what you're doing?

57
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,910
See,

58
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,954
a beautiful woman,

59
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,000
has to offer a man
her secrets.

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,388
I mean, that is so beautiful
I can't tell you.

61
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:52,805
You see, everyone in the world
is very screwed up.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,853
Now I know that you're not screwed up

63
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:00,486
And i'm not. And I know
the answer, and you know the answer.

64
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,649
But,

65
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:07,737
we can't tell them the answer
unless they ask us the question.

66
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:08,867
You see?

67
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,248
Tell me what a good time is.

68
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,954
A good time?

69
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,081
Yeah, you have to be with someone
to have a good time, don't ya?

70
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,126
Yeah, that helps.

71
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:29,175
Sex?

72
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:36,437
I think we do need that.

73
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,183
Yeah, for money.

74
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,157
You don't enjoy it?

75
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,287
You need someone to be with
to have a good time, don't ya?

76
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:59,412
Yeah, it helps.

77
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,788
Well, then tell me what a good time is.

78
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,718
Is it school?

79
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,638
Is it books, is it music, is it movies?

80
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,851
- What's the question?
- Good time, the best time, right?

81
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:20,722
Cooking.

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,818
I love to cook.

83
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,487
Cooking?

84
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:29,651
Cooking is the best time you've ever had?
Give me a break!

85
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,576
Give me another drink, over here.

86
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:33,454
I guess dreaming.

87
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,663
What do you dream?

88
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,685
Are you gay?

89
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:25,930
No.

90
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:27,812
Sorry.

91
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:29,856
No, I'm not.

92
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:35,480
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're safe here.

93
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,458
I'm Jill Dunbar.

94
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,205
The judge.

95
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:29,793
I'm Sarah Lawson.

96
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,335
This is my daughter Debbie.

97
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:49,308
Judge Dunbar?
Hi, I'm Milton Kravitz.

98
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,402
I represent Mrs. Lawson.
Have you two met?

99
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:55,654
Are you comfortable there?

100
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,027
Yeah, sure.

101
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:13,874
Sorry we're late.
Traffic was terrible.

102
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:17,797
You're beautiful.

103
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,051
Come over and sit here, please.

104
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:27,139
Why don't we have Debbie wait outside?

105
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,311
There is no reason for her to be here?

106
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,397
No, it's okay. I want to be here.

107
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:35,610
Sure, go outside Debbie. It'll just take
a minute and we'll call you right back in.

108
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,400
Jack, could she stay here, please?

109
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:40,655
I mean, she knows everything.

110
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:44,034
We don't want our baby
standing out in the hall.

111
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,628
We are in agreement on
the money settlement.

112
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,920
That is correct.

113
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:01,385
And Debbie has agreed to live with her mother,
there is no disagreement on that.

114
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,259
You sign these, we can finish quickly.

115
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,858
I have immediate plans to take Debbie
with me to Houston or New York.

116
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,645
I don't know when we'll be back.

117
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,235
New York?

118
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,148
Houston?
Where did that come in?

119
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,702
We're not gonna go to a funeral.
It's okay.

120
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:30,413
What is the understanding that you've
come to on this visit?

121
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:34,002
You see, we go to
a lot of funerals.

122
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:38,378
I go to funerals,
and hospitals

123
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,834
and some weddings.

124
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:46,015
You might say that's what I do:
I visit sick people.

125
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:48,968
Mothers, fathers,

126
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,977
sisters, brothers,

127
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,730
uncles,

128
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:55,813
nephews, aunts.

129
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,946
I don't have any relatives myself,
but Jack does.

130
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:06,782
Some of these are in Houston,
and Jack's aunt is in New York.

131
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:11,788
Which I would feel very uncomfortable
going to if she wasn't there.

132
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,291
But nobody died this time.

133
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,210
Just sick, you know.

134
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:26,712
People like Debbie and me
to be with them

135
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,431
when they aren't feeling well,
because we're cheerful.

136
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:36,982
Says right here: "Visiting privileges
every other weekend.

137
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,312
From Saturday noon til Sunday at 7.

138
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:43,280
Mr. Lawson will be entitled to take
Debbie Lawson

139
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,274
to where he resides or any
other reasonable place."

140
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,742
Wasn't that what you had agreed to?

141
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,248
You see Judge

142
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,087
when someone is temporarily insane

143
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,671
like Jack here is...

144
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,215
And he's a wonderful guy, but...

145
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:11,048
You see,
when someone is like that,

146
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:15,136
they don't want to see the
people that they really love.

147
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,689
Okay, I understand that.

148
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,984
A person who is sick has to get well

149
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,864
before he can be normal, right?

150
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:31,442
So, when Jack finishes his...

151
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,832
sleeping around everywhere,

152
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,042
and he wants to assume
his responsibilities,

153
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:42,332
he wants to be a real father to Debbie,
he can see her.

154
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,669
If Debbie is a very old lady when
he makes up his mind,

155
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,927
that's when he'll see her.

156
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,263
I don't understand.

157
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,182
You feel that your husband

158
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,653
should not see Debbie at all?
Ever?

159
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:12,364
Well, I object. I think Mrs. Lawson
is breaking the understanding.

160
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,204
I don't understand.

161
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:17,074
I don't understand.

162
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,333
He's the one that wants a divorce.

163
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:27,046
One of the reasons we're having difficulty

164
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,299
with something we've already agreed to,

165
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:31,718
is that my wife hasn't been cured.

166
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:34,133
I'm a very happy person.

167
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:37,309
My wife has been in and out of institutions
since our marriage.

168
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,561
That's one of the reasons why we're having difficulty
with something that we've already agreed to.

169
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,317
She hasn't been cured.

170
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,567
I have a problem. I...

171
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,156
I love my family. I love him,
and I love her. I love them, just them.

172
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:56,485
And,

173
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:00,705
when I can't be cheerful...

174
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:09,297
When you get a headache, or

175
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,801
you feel really bad.

176
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,340
I go to the hospital.

177
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:20,719
And I stay there until I feel that I can
take care of things again.

178
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:24,936
Just stepping out of the way for awhile.

179
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:30,355
Until his little sex things are over...

180
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:34,818
Whatever it is that causes me
to get the headaches...

181
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,656
Something like that.

182
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,322
Could I have a glass of champagne
in a crystal glass, please?

183
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,533
I love crystal!

184
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,537
I'm Phyllis. That's my stage name.

185
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:28,538
Lovely nails you have.

186
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,965
You're a straight

187
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,549
and a marvelous writer.

188
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:39,425
I just love the way you
write about loneliness.

189
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,642
You make it sound so
exciting and romantic.

190
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:47,895
I saw you in here last month.
Are you working on a new book?

191
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,494
Are you doing
something on us?

192
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:07,370
Yes, i'm writing a book on nightlife,
as a matter of fact.

193
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:16,674
Could I have your telephone number
please, your card, something?

194
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,250
Lucky boy!

195
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,805
Now is this for research or what?

196
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,427
It's uh...

197
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,013
She's beautiful.

198
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,480
You know her name?

199
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,813
Susan.

200
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,524
I think with all beautiful women,
they have a secret.

201
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,161
And the interesting thing,

202
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,825
is to get that secret out.

203
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,615
If they volunteer that secret to me.

204
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,046
Yeah, I guess.

205
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:56,292
I'm a writer,
that's why i'm saying that.

206
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:59,417
I know, I saw you on TV.

207
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:04,006
Haven't read any of your books, though,
don't have too much time.

208
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,767
- I did the cigarette trick...
- Watch the tablecloth.

209
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,474
Give me your glass.

210
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,228
What should we drink to?

211
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,407
I can't think of anything.

212
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,948
You're ambitious enough, I think.

213
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,880
When I came in here about a month ago,

214
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,464
there were these two
very cute little girls

215
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:43,675
that were singing along with you.
They were backup singers.

216
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,809
They're not here anymore.
And that bothers me.

217
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,810
- Does it bother you?
- No.

218
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:08,495
What time is it?

219
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,665
I want to write a book about you.

220
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,963
Why, you think I want to be a big star?

221
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:26,638
I've gotta go.

222
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,224
It was fun.

223
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,199
I like the way you move.

224
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,870
I really like the way you move.

225
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,731
I'm right here.

226
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,566
That's nice.

227
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,574
Give me your keys, give me your keys.

228
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:37,707
My dress!

229
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,249
You know what they say about
beautiful women. Their secrets.

230
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,212
They'll give 'em to you gladly, this is...

231
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:23,168
Where do you live?

232
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,209
Do you know where you live?

233
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:26,884
Get out, okay.

234
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,300
Get out of here!

235
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:34,381
Well then, move over.

236
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,855
Gotta get out of my car.

237
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:47,311
Get out!

238
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,274
Out of my car!

239
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,158
Enough, okay!

240
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,658
Come on! Let go!

241
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:56,862
Get out of here.

242
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,790
You're amazingly strong.

243
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:02,997
I'll drive, alright.

244
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:04,957
Where do you live?

245
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,171
I'll drive.

246
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:18,134
Make a right, at the corner.

247
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:40,370
Okay, this is fine,
this is fine, stop.

248
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,872
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

249
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:45,373
Turn off the lights.

250
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,086
Turn the radio off. Are you crazy?
Give me the keys.

251
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,085
Can you walk?
Come on, we gotta get off the street.

252
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:18,803
Put your arm around me.

253
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,305
You taking me to bed?

254
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,435
Where are we?

255
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,319
My house.

256
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:39,194
Perfect ending to a
lovely evening.

257
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:50,076
I'm alright.

258
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,370
I'm alright...

259
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,975
I'm usually a lot more fun,
i'll tell you that right now.

260
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:23,571
Come on darling, I want you
to eat some soup now.

261
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,747
Do the best you can.

262
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:30,913
Cuz i've got to get you out of
this room so the child can play.

263
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:08,827
Hi, Robert.
I'll be right with you.

264
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,456
Is that your mom?

265
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,887
I really should give you
a lot of money, but I...

266
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:33,263
A few thousand dollars will do.

267
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:45,237
I want to thank you very,
very much for what you've done.

268
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:50,031
You're very welcome. I was really
the one who did the most for you.

269
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:53,084
She wouldn't do anything.
I had to undress you.

270
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:56,371
You're the one that undressed me?
You took all my clothes off?

271
00:26:56,797 --> 00:26:59,085
And you nursed me,
and you washed my shirt?

272
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,671
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

273
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,718
But I don't want you
to be a mother now.

274
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:09,847
Because it confuses me when a beautiful
women like you becomes a mother.

275
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,180
I'm not a mother really.

276
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,098
Good bye, thank you.

277
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:42,840
Excuse me, please.

278
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:46,090
I'm really sorry to be late.

279
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,466
Well, you understand.

280
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,425
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me...

281
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:03,103
Okay. We can start.

282
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:06,445
Mother.

283
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,027
I want to go with my father.

284
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,581
I hate my life with you.

285
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,958
I hate going to see all
those dying people.

286
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,130
I hate being with those old people.

287
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,216
They smell.

288
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,564
Excuse me, could I sit there, please?

289
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,923
They smell?

290
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:16,100
When did you first decide
that they smell?

291
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,523
I want to go with my father.

292
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,693
I don't want to go with you anymore.

293
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,699
I don't want to be a slave.

294
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,368
Nice...

295
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:44,628
Nobody leave this room

296
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:49,844
until we find out what it means.

297
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:55,304
I can discuss it.
I have a lot of time.

298
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:02,054
What is it that you want to discuss?

299
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:04,852
Love.

300
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:15,739
We're dealing with legal matters.

301
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:20,030
And as painful as it seems,

302
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:24,912
this is usual in divorce cases.

303
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:31,461
Please, Mrs. Lawson.
I must ask you to sit down, please.

304
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,571
Roll her over on her side.

305
00:30:57,828 --> 00:31:00,497
You're going to be okay, darling.
Just relax.

306
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:03,620
You're doing real good.
Just relax.

307
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:08,416
We love you. We love you.
Just relax.

308
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:12,630
So what do you think that is?

309
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,843
Loss.

310
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:23,263
You don't own anything. So how can
you lose something that you don't own?

311
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:38,776
Love is a stream.

312
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:43,619
It's continuous.
It doesn't stop.

313
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,499
No, it does stop.

314
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,585
Oh no, it does not stop.

315
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:54,921
Your love is too strong for your family.

316
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:00,513
I want you to describe your sexual life.

317
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:16,357
- I don't have a sexual life.
- You do.

318
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:21,403
I don't need a sexual life.

319
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:32,794
What other interests do you have
besides your husband?

320
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:34,169
He doesn't love you.

321
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:39,669
That's not true.

322
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,423
And your daughter who
chose him over you.

323
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,274
If you don't let go, and if you
don't get some balance in your life,

324
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:59,440
something creative, some sex,
I don't care with whom,

325
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:04,238
then you're going to have to go back to
the bughouse where you don't belong.

326
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,579
Go to Europe.
They don't know you there.

327
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:19,131
You have money, see something.

328
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:21,001
Be alone.

329
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:24,630
Meet someone, you're attractive.

330
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:14,767
Oh, thank god.
Will you help me, please?

331
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,934
I am American,
and I must have your help.

332
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,691
I have all of this luggage.

333
00:34:25,284 --> 00:34:29,033
I'll give you $25 if you help me, please.

334
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:08,067
Listen to me. Listen.

335
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:10,408
You can understand me if you want to.

336
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:13,913
I have to get this baggage,
I have no one to help me.

337
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,743
Maybe you should get a carriage.
But I must get to track 9.

338
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:20,832
And i'm already late.

339
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,009
You'll take it for me, right?

340
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:28,505
You're not going to go away, are you?

341
00:35:31,684 --> 00:35:33,178
You're coming back, right?

342
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,143
I'm going to wait for you right here.

343
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:39,101
I'll be right here, okay.

344
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,524
That's good. You're just fine,
just go on ahead.

345
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,411
That's it. Over a little bit to
the right. That's it.

346
00:35:58,877 --> 00:36:00,253
Wait. Wait.

347
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:02,755
I've got it.

348
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,635
Are you taking a bus or
do you want a taxi?

349
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:11,294
No, I want a plane.

350
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:13,508
I'm going to go home.
I've got to get out of here.

351
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:17,344
Well you can't take a plane from here, love.
This is a train station, they roll 'em out of here.

352
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:20,808
I've got to get home.
Listen, would you do me a favor?

353
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:24,393
Would you make a call for me, please.
Would you telephone my husband.

354
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:27,363
I want to call him in
Chicago, Illinois.

355
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,074
I hate Europe.

356
00:36:42,004 --> 00:36:43,913
Can I have the overseas operator, please.

357
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:47,464
- France was worse.
- I don't like that place much myself.

358
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:50,673
Yes, i'd like to place a personal call.

359
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:52,503
Couldn't talk to anybody there.

360
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,217
Who am I calling?

361
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:56,684
Mr. Jack Lawson.

362
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:01,432
In the United States.

363
00:37:02,232 --> 00:37:04,640
What's his number, love?

364
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,402
Reverse the charges.

365
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,410
What's your name, love?

366
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:18,028
Sarah.

367
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:27,748
Here you go, love. They're ringing
right through. Come on.

368
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,224
I'm almost not crazy now.

369
00:37:43,023 --> 00:37:44,600
I just don't care.

370
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,520
You alright, love?

371
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:37,617
I'm fine, I'm fine.

372
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,365
Hi, Robert.
How are you?

373
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,077
How have you been?

374
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,711
What are you doing here?

375
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,625
Well, I happened to be
in the neighborhood...

376
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:57,253
Actually I hadn't heard from you
and I wondered how you were.

377
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:02,178
Actually, my mother was worried about you.
I think she misses you.

378
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,844
Everybody's always worried about me.

379
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:08,606
Actually i'm fine, you can see that.
And I can't let you in.

380
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:12,690
It's okay, I don't want to come in.
Guess you have company.

381
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:14,357
You're right there.

382
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:19,570
I've got to go to work.

383
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:23,245
I wanted to ask you something.

384
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,329
Do you think we should see
each other again or what?

385
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:33,541
I'd like for us to be friends,
if you want a friend.

386
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:43,598
Take care of yourself, Robert.

387
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:46,518
Keep in touch, okay?

388
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,787
Oh, geez, turn the light off.

389
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:10,543
I'm going to kill someone.

390
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:18,468
What's the matter?

391
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:20,754
I'm looking for my white shoes.

392
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:24,803
White shoes. Did you see
Phyllis' big white shoes?

393
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:27,143
Underneath the kitchen table.

394
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:58,173
Get that, please.

395
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,175
So what?

396
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:13,094
Who was it?

397
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:16,269
There's a car coming
around to the front.

398
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:32,204
There is some lady and a little boy here.
And he's carrying a whole bunch of flowers.

399
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:35,667
They're coming up to the front door, Robert.

400
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:46,966
This is your son.

401
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,856
You owe him for four weeks.

402
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:00,937
You want this in one check,
or you want it in four checks?

403
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:02,565
One check.

404
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,406
Here is some flowers.

405
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:07,649
Thank you. But let me just get this...

406
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:10,823
Robert, I gotta ask you a favor.
Would you do it?

407
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,162
If it's for money, yes.

408
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:17,376
You asked me not to call,
so I wrote you 3 letters.

409
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,963
I just don't answer my mail.

410
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:25,968
My husband and I, we have a big chance to
raise some money in someone's big house.

411
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,466
We'll stay overnight.
And they don't want kids.

412
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,850
- You want me to take the boy.
- Yeah, overnight.

413
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:40,983
- Until when?
- We'll be home tomorrow at 2pm.

414
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:43,852
Alright.

415
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:46,523
You haven't even seen your
son since he was born.

416
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:48,401
I said yes, didn't I?

417
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:52,161
I'll be home Sunday night.
Today's Saturday.

418
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,080
I even have Albie's suitcase in the car.

419
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:58,039
Fine, let's get the suitcase and let's
get on with it.  Come on, let's go.

420
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,798
Wave goodbye to your mother.

421
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,561
Flowers.

422
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:25,400
Really nice, wanna hold 'em?

423
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,661
Close the door.

424
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:47,172
I'm gonna introduce you to some people.

425
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:56,182
This is my son Albie.

426
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,971
I'd like to introduce you to Charlene,

427
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,645
who is my secretary,
my friend, my accountant

428
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:05,694
and her daughter Renee
who is also my friend.

429
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,737
- How old are you?
- 8.

430
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,361
Well, let's go.

431
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,288
Yeah, what do you want?

432
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:28,207
This is my son Albie.
He's going to spend the night with us.

433
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:31,426
Hi, Albie.

434
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,880
What's wrong?

435
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:57,037
Robert, go get him.

436
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:01,289
He's your son for god's sake!

437
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:40,336
- Alright, come on. Let's go.
- Mr. Harmon?

438
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:41,933
Don't call me Mr. Harmon.

439
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:45,309
That's insulting.
I know it and you know it.

440
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:48,724
- I hate you.
- Yeah I know, that's cuz i'm your father.

441
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:00,196
The boy still asleep?

442
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,202
Yeah, he's upstairs in bed.

443
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,783
Here's your check.

444
00:47:04,998 --> 00:47:06,078
Thank you, darling.

445
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,035
Mary, Annette.

446
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:10,372
Thank you, I love you.

447
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:12,295
Joanie.

448
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:15,332
Joanie, i'm sorry Phyllis.

449
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:18,092
Charlene, have your numbers?

450
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:45,401
Take good care of these chickens, okay.

451
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,950
You take care, bye baby.

452
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,214
You're the man now, you take
care of these little children.

453
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:59,665
Goodbye kids, good luck in your new careers.

454
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:20,483
Bye bye, sweetheart.

455
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:35,099
We'll be alright, Robert.

456
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:37,023
You better get back to the kid.

457
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:39,191
You shouldn't leave him alone.

458
00:50:32,204 --> 00:50:33,699
Are you awake?

459
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,043
Go to your right, then go right again.

460
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:53,764
Can I use your toothbrush?

461
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,351
Use your finger.

462
00:50:57,772 --> 00:50:59,930
I want to have breakfast, but

463
00:51:01,984 --> 00:51:03,727
I have to clean up first.

464
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:09,323
If I have breakfast without cleaning up I vomit.

465
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:15,071
You get through with this, you can help me...

466
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:21,956
get these empty cigarette packs off here...

467
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:26,503
and this stuff here, then we can eat.

468
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:19,383
All done.

469
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,987
Want a drink? Would you like
a Coca-Cola, or a beer?

470
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,694
A beer.

471
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:03,559
Would you like a little toast?

472
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:41,930
Did you run away because I was born?

473
00:53:44,062 --> 00:53:47,561
No, I didn't even know you were coming.

474
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:59,534
I don't like men a lot, you know.

475
00:54:00,495 --> 00:54:03,200
I'm a writer. I don't make money on men.

476
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:06,322
No one's really interested.
They're kinda boring.

477
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,670
When you're 14 I think you oughta...

478
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,547
hitchhike across the country,

479
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:25,008
go into a truckstop, stop there.

480
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:28,805
Have a cup of coffee,

481
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:32,066
and see what men are really like, you know.

482
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:36,899
Men. Not these people out here
with the suits and ties...

483
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:39,192
that kind of stuff, you know.

484
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,371
I had a picture of you.

485
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:48,493
My father tore it up.

486
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:52,586
My mother cried,

487
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,878
they had a big fight, and he hit her.

488
00:54:56,718 --> 00:55:00,632
And they changed my name to
Albie Swanson, like his.

489
00:55:01,889 --> 00:55:04,807
And mother cries all the
time thinking about you.

490
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:07,726
Please come back to her.

491
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:19,521
She sleeps with another
man every night, you know.

492
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,400
You know what that means?

493
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,570
She has had a baby by another man.

494
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,909
So, that part of...

495
00:55:32,044 --> 00:55:33,788
that part of...

496
00:55:35,756 --> 00:55:37,299
is over.

497
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:44,514
I don't like women anyway, you know.
I really don't. I like kids.

498
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:50,304
And I like older people.

499
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:55,900
Cuz they seem to have the secret...

500
00:55:57,945 --> 00:55:59,570
They don't need anything.

501
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:02,488
You don't need anything.

502
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,281
They just want...
You're innocent.

503
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,698
And so are old people, they're innocent.
That's what I like about them.

504
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:12,489
Drink your drink here.
Come on, drink it down.

505
00:56:37,276 --> 00:56:38,604
Hey, dad!

506
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:52,871
What's wrong?

507
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:56,951
Someone's here. There's a cab
outside. There's two cabs.

508
00:56:57,629 --> 00:57:00,500
You go out there and you tell them

509
00:57:02,926 --> 00:57:04,337
to go away.

510
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:20,936
I have a lady in the cab.

511
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:29,197
Paris.

512
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:43,503
Dad?

513
00:57:49,973 --> 00:57:52,013
This is my son Albie,
from the second marriage.

514
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:53,969
Albie, Sarah.

515
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:02,683
Oh, my god.
I haven't seen you...

516
00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:08,857
I haven't seen him since he
was in the hospital being born.

517
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,573
I would've brought you a present, only I
didn't know I was going to be here...

518
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,660
I didn't know you were going to...
I didn't know I was going to...

519
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:18,991
Hi.

520
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:25,044
- A load of trunks.
- Yeah, I see that.

521
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,127
Well take them all into the house, alright.

522
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:29,627
Alright Jim, let's get these bags.

523
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:38,634
Let's take it in.

524
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,238
I just can't believe it.

525
00:58:53,453 --> 00:58:56,573
I can't believe I got here, I can't
believe i'm actually here.

526
00:58:56,873 --> 00:58:59,411
I can't believe i'm seeing you.

527
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:07,167
You're nuts. You're really nuttier
than fruitcake. I love you.

528
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,171
Where do these bags go?

529
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:17,176
Bags go- you can put 'em on
the first floor or the upstai...

530
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:19,137
put 'em on the upstairs landing, alright?

531
00:59:19,854 --> 00:59:22,524
Just, on the upstairs landing.
That'll be good.

532
00:59:23,316 --> 00:59:24,229
How about a drink?

533
00:59:24,442 --> 00:59:27,229
No, I really shouldn't.
Perhaps, well, one maybe.

534
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:30,731
One only, cuz I was flying
first class and...

535
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:34,318
- Well, this is not going to hurt ya.
- Make it a weak one, please.

536
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:37,987
Get a little ice. Need
a little ice for ya.

537
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,792
Put it in this glass.
Sorry, excuse me.

538
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:54,882
Do you like your father?

539
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,689
Well he happens to be a wonderful
person, everybody likes him.

540
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:14,657
- Will you have vodka, scotch?
- Yeah, just a small one really.

541
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,541
Albie's mother brought him over here,

542
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:25,162
cuz I haven't seen him
since he was born either.

543
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:28,877
We were just reminiscing,
going over old times.

544
01:00:30,216 --> 01:00:31,414
Gettin' drunk.

545
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:35,844
And i'm gonna take him to Las Vegas.

546
01:00:36,222 --> 01:00:37,502
Las Vegas?

547
01:00:38,057 --> 01:00:38,923
You want to go?

548
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:44,681
Do you want her to go?

549
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:46,351
No.

550
01:00:47,483 --> 01:00:49,523
- Okay, go get your bag.
- But dad.

551
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:51,520
Get your bad, let's go.

552
01:00:53,698 --> 01:00:55,240
You want to see the rest of the house?

553
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,444
Come on, i'll show you the house.

554
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,279
This is the kitchen.

555
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:03,529
The kitchen.

556
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,576
- Can you drive?
- Sure I can drive.

557
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:11,005
Here are the keys to my car,
and you go down to...

558
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,417
you go down to...

559
01:01:13,718 --> 01:01:15,544
out of the driveway, turn right,

560
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:17,884
go down right again,
then you hit Ventura.

561
01:01:18,097 --> 01:01:21,680
And there's a big shopping center
down there and you can't miss it.

562
01:01:28,065 --> 01:01:30,058
I read all your books.

563
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:34,192
Yeah, they're in the bookcase.

564
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:37,366
- They're all about women.
- I know.

565
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:39,199
What took you so long?

566
01:01:45,332 --> 01:01:47,788
If anyone calls, just say I died.

567
01:01:48,002 --> 01:01:49,626
Yeah? How long are you going to be dead?

568
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:51,913
I don't know. Couple of days, just say.

569
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,282
Who was that?

570
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:26,947
- Sarah, you mean?
- Yeah, Sarah.

571
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,738
Do you love her?

572
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:31,577
Not the way you mean.

573
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:33,791
Do you kiss her?

574
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:37,170
Not the way you mean, I said.

575
01:02:48,854 --> 01:02:50,562
Imperial Palace.

576
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:54,518
Ah, Dean ! How are ya?

577
01:02:54,735 --> 01:02:56,608
Here for a little R&R, or ya gonna
make an assault on us this trip?

578
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,904
- Ah, I got my bodyguard with me.
- Your a computer expert, I know it.

579
01:03:00,115 --> 01:03:03,033
Albie, This is Dean Shindel.
Say hello.

580
01:03:03,243 --> 01:03:06,778
Your suite's blocked and your
tux is pressed and on the way up.

581
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:13,042
Where would you like your bag, Mr. Harmon?

582
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:14,795
On the bed.

583
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:21,171
That's fine.

584
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:24,920
- Here ya are, my friend.
- Thank you, sir.  There's your key.

585
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:48,027
- Your tuxedo.
- Oh good. Thank you.

586
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:54,041
Put it right there on the chair.
You have the shoes?

587
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:58,330
The shirt, the tie, everything in there?

588
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:02,714
- Anything else?
- No, no. Here.

589
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:07,504
How do you feel?

590
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:10,470
Okay.

591
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:15,890
Still a little drunk?

592
01:04:17,817 --> 01:04:19,561
Stomach a little upset?

593
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,401
You oughta go to sleep.

594
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:33,036
Listen.

595
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:35,250
I'm a man.

596
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:40,497
And a man, is different
than a little kid.

597
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:45,675
I find it very hard
to go to sleep alone.

598
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,763
You know what I mean, don't you?

599
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:51,057
- Do you?
- Yeah.

600
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,154
Maid!

601
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,332
Can I turn down your bed?

602
01:05:19,921 --> 01:05:21,296
Did you just get in?

603
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:22,620
Earlier.

604
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,500
You're all by yourself, huh?

605
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:27,379
You hungry?

606
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,755
A big boy like you is not hungry?

607
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,058
When did you eat last?
Where's your mom?

608
01:05:34,936 --> 01:05:36,560
In Los Angeles.

609
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:07,915
Not right now.

610
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:16,302
Oh, I gotta give you checks.

611
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:27,152
Carla Friedricks.

612
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,195
Spell it.

613
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:42,367
Gotta see my son, you know.

614
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:48,709
Love is everything.

615
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:50,842
Love is everything.
Just remember that.

616
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:53,840
- Go.
- I love you girls.

617
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:57,092
Remember the Alamo.
Remember Smokey Joe.

618
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:44,598
Take me home, please. I want to go home.
I want to see my mother, my mom.

619
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,519
I want to go. I want to see my mother.
I want my mom.

620
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:53,983
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell
you I was gonna go out all night?

621
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,694
Didn't I?

622
01:07:56,827 --> 01:08:00,278
I told you I was going out all night,
I was gonna be with somebody, didn't I?

623
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,537
And you said okay, right?

624
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:07,035
You said you're gonna be a man
and i'm gonna be a man, right?

625
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:14,302
No, don't do that!

626
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,344
- Didn't I say to you...
- I want to go.

627
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,937
Didn't I say to you, didn't I
say to you that I was going...

628
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:29,682
Wait a minute now. Didn't I say
I was going out with somebody?

629
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,392
Didn't I say I was gonna go find somebody?

630
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,687
I want to go.
I want to see my mother.

631
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:41,203
I want to go home.
I want to go.

632
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,956
- Get out. Where is your house?
- Right over there.

633
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:59,593
Albie, I just want to say i'm
sorry the vacation didn't work out.

634
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:10,352
Mom!

635
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:30,199
Albie, what happened to yourself?
Come on, what happened?

636
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:33,796
What happened, son. Did he do
this to you? What happened?

637
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,757
What did he do to you?

638
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:55,813
I'm Robert Harmon.

639
01:10:00,116 --> 01:10:02,524
Eddie, stop!
Stop it, Eddie!

640
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,658
It's not your son, Eddie!

641
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:15,620
... your ass long enough ...
Stay there!

642
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,883
Dad, I love you dad.

643
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:26,302
I love you, dad.

644
01:10:26,517 --> 01:10:27,846
Come on.

645
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:36,227
I love him.
He's my father, I love him.

646
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:41,822
Dad, I love you.

647
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:43,950
I love you, dad.

648
01:11:37,463 --> 01:11:40,298
- He's your son, Robert.
- Too late.

649
01:11:42,176 --> 01:11:43,754
Robert, he's your son!

650
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:05,656
Here we are, pal. 28 dollars.

651
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:32,047
G'night.

652
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,002
Susan called.

653
01:15:59,504 --> 01:16:00,963
She called me?

654
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:03,957
That's your girlfriend, isn't it?

655
01:16:30,495 --> 01:16:32,155
Uh, Robert Harmon here.

656
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:36,284
Yeah. You are Margarita.
You're the mother.

657
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:41,210
Well listen, i'm the guy that
got sick all over your house.

658
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:45,921
I thought i'd come over and have
a drink with you and thank you.

659
01:16:48,597 --> 01:16:49,795
Don't argue with me.

660
01:16:50,014 --> 01:16:53,052
I won't take no for an answer.
Be there in 20 minutes.

661
01:16:57,523 --> 01:16:59,398
Fought with Albie, huh?

662
01:17:01,987 --> 01:17:04,941
Yeah, well, life is a series
of suicides, divorces,

663
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:08,027
promises broken, children smashed,
whatever.

664
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:12,110
You oughta go to sleep.

665
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:16,032
I'm not sleepy.
It's only about 9 o'clock.

666
01:17:22,382 --> 01:17:27,259
You look awful. Gotta get some rest, gotta
go out and get some sun, this is California.

667
01:17:30,016 --> 01:17:33,432
Ya know, with kids I don't think
you can do the right thing.

668
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:37,724
I mean, you always think you know
just what's suppose to be, and...

669
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:41,776
You know what my shrink told me?
You know what this quack...

670
01:17:41,986 --> 01:17:43,314
Watch your feet here.

671
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:45,771
You know the guy in Chicago.

672
01:17:46,533 --> 01:17:49,819
He told me, his big advice
was to go to Europe,

673
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:53,737
to find some handsome guy,
to have a love affair,

674
01:17:53,957 --> 01:17:57,292
if that didn't work, I was
suppose to be creative, paint.

675
01:17:57,544 --> 01:17:59,620
Can we walk and talk?

676
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,049
Hey, I don't want to go to bed.

677
01:18:05,927 --> 01:18:07,423
No more emotion now, let's go.

678
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:11,339
I'm not being emotional.
I just, i'm tired.

679
01:18:13,019 --> 01:18:16,055
Oh, I wanna go- you're right.
I'm going to bed.

680
01:18:17,232 --> 01:18:18,775
Very tired.

681
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,803
Get out of here.

682
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:08,655
I have to go. I have to see
this old lady about a house.

683
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:11,787
And I have to have a drink with her,
and I have to change my clothes,

684
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:15,331
and I have to take a shower, and I
have to be really neat, okay?

685
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,710
I'll have breakfast with you in the morning.

686
01:19:26,645 --> 01:19:27,843
I'm gonna turn off the light.

687
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:42,180
What's all this, what are you doing?

688
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:46,140
I need some crystal glasses,

689
01:20:46,604 --> 01:20:48,182
and some ice, and...

690
01:20:51,693 --> 01:20:54,184
- I've got everything.
- You do?

691
01:20:56,113 --> 01:20:57,277
Come on in.

692
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:48,688
Sarah.
Sarah, I need you.

693
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:51,849
I know this doesn't
make any sense, but

694
01:22:52,277 --> 01:22:55,030
this house is very,
very empty without you.

695
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:57,940
I love you, you dumbo-head.

696
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:02,159
We're divorced, Sarah.
That part of our life is over.

697
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:03,949
I'm just saying that it's...

698
01:23:04,498 --> 01:23:07,702
it's hard to...
tough to bring up a kid.

699
01:23:08,669 --> 01:23:11,956
I know it doesn't make any sense,
but that's what you should be doing.

700
01:23:17,554 --> 01:23:19,132
Goodbye, Sarah.

701
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:54,875
I want you to be patient with me because
I don't know exactly where i'm going yet.

702
01:24:07,565 --> 01:24:08,894
How are you?

703
01:24:10,568 --> 01:24:12,939
To tell you the truth, i'm...

704
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:28,539
Tell you the truth i'm very
concerned about my daughter.

705
01:24:29,003 --> 01:24:30,748
Well, we're all concerned.

706
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:33,756
Oh god, you too?

707
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:35,759
Oh, i'm sorry, well...

708
01:24:36,553 --> 01:24:38,178
You know all about
it too then, huh?

709
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:39,717
About it?

710
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,764
About the balance, and...

711
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:49,315
Tell you the truth,
this is my first time, and I...

712
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:51,892
i'm looking for the sex.

713
01:24:52,112 --> 01:24:54,234
Well, you'll need bowling shoes.

714
01:24:54,447 --> 01:24:56,191
Oh thanks, I don't use 'em.

715
01:24:56,449 --> 01:24:58,359
Well, you're on lane 13, mam.

716
01:25:22,352 --> 01:25:23,597
Hey, honey.

717
01:25:24,312 --> 01:25:27,763
- You're gonna slip all over the place.
- Don't worry about it.

718
01:25:27,982 --> 01:25:29,975
You want me to keep score?

719
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:33,644
You can if you want to, but it
isn't necessary. I don't keep score.

720
01:25:33,864 --> 01:25:35,274
You don't keep score?

721
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,064
If I bowl a strike, I remember it.

722
01:25:38,285 --> 01:25:41,702
Alright, give me one.
Give me one, come on.

723
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:44,950
Right down the middle.

724
01:25:48,086 --> 01:25:49,368
Watch this.

725
01:25:50,715 --> 01:25:54,499
You're better than Al!
You're better than Al! He's a bum.

726
01:25:55,595 --> 01:26:00,091
My first husband- i mean, my only husband-
anyway, he loved to bowl.

727
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:04,639
Okay, lets see two in a row.
Five dollars, Al.

728
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:10,233
Two in a row, okay?

729
01:26:10,443 --> 01:26:12,317
Okay. Brace yourselves.

730
01:26:12,529 --> 01:26:15,364
She's doing better than you, Dottie,
i'll tell you that right now.

731
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:22,039
Don't wait, honey.

732
01:26:23,415 --> 01:26:26,832
Don't wait. Just roll the ball,
ya gotta have a follow-through.

733
01:26:46,065 --> 01:26:49,268
Just relax, just relax. What, Ken?

734
01:26:49,485 --> 01:26:51,811
Let me tell you something, look.

735
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:57,067
Let me tell ya. If you stand up...
Now wait a second.

736
01:26:57,284 --> 01:27:00,735
If you stand up, I got the ball right here.
You got no pressure, right.

737
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:07,166
No, wait a second now.

738
01:27:07,503 --> 01:27:08,666
Now go ahead.

739
01:27:09,589 --> 01:27:11,878
Just relax, okay. Take a deep breath.

740
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,674
Put the chalk, put the chalk on there.
Now watch this. Watch.

741
01:27:15,887 --> 01:27:17,263
Pull it out.

742
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:19,260
It's alright.

743
01:27:21,185 --> 01:27:23,142
- There you go.
- It was easy.

744
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,474
Isn't that crazy.

745
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:30,476
It doesn't hurt or anything.

746
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:31,976
Thank you.

747
01:27:35,157 --> 01:27:37,862
- That certainly never happened.
- I'm gonna put it back.

748
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:42,325
No, i'm not afraid.
I've got another one coming.

749
01:28:41,352 --> 01:28:42,977
Do you walk?

750
01:29:19,476 --> 01:29:22,097
You're a good dancer, you walk?

751
01:29:23,688 --> 01:29:26,096
I walk, I run, I do everything.

752
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:28,854
Okay you walk with me, ready?

753
01:29:39,663 --> 01:29:43,115
You dance by yourself,
let me see your stuff.

754
01:30:00,685 --> 01:30:03,722
I haven't done this for a long time.

755
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,829
Let's sit down like
ladies and gentlemen here.

756
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:25,367
Let's sit down here like
ladies and gentlemen. Hold on.

757
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:27,039
Let me seat you.

758
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,050
I'm sorry.

759
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,918
Don't get embarrassed ...

760
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,468
asses.

761
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:48,516
A beautiful light,
and a beautiful red dress.

762
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,352
Honey, you're late

763
01:30:52,572 --> 01:30:57,152
Hello Frank, how are you?
Oh we were having such a party.

764
01:30:57,370 --> 01:31:00,905
I'm sorry you came in so late.
Come on over and meet Robert.

765
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:03,781
We were having such a good time.

766
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:08,420
You asleep?

767
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:10,751
Are you okay?

768
01:31:13,303 --> 01:31:14,881
Ya wanna glass of milk?

769
01:31:15,097 --> 01:31:17,173
Tomorrow morning.

770
01:31:17,724 --> 01:31:19,349
Give me a kiss.

771
01:31:19,977 --> 01:31:21,685
Go back to sleep.

772
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:37,612
Honey, don't worry.
Billy is alright.

773
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:41,114
We were having such a good time.

774
01:31:41,332 --> 01:31:44,250
I was showing Robert
how I used to dance,

775
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,581
but I couldn't make up
a good enough costume.

776
01:31:47,798 --> 01:31:49,588
Mom, go to bed now, okay?

777
01:31:50,466 --> 01:31:52,008
You go home, okay?

778
01:31:52,553 --> 01:31:53,927
Party's over alright.

779
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:56,712
I gotta get up early tomorrow, that's why.

780
01:31:58,225 --> 01:31:59,423
Goodnight, darling.

781
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,012
She's a wonderful woman.

782
01:32:04,898 --> 01:32:08,267
She doesn't get a chance to go out
and show off a lot, you know.

783
01:32:08,485 --> 01:32:09,814
I know.

784
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,575
Goodnight, teeth. I love you.
Goodnight.

785
01:32:42,564 --> 01:32:46,014
I had a wonderful time.
A wonderful time.

786
01:32:47,026 --> 01:32:48,189
Thank you.

787
01:32:50,655 --> 01:32:53,490
You are the cutest guy I ever met.

788
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:43,823
You want some coffee?

789
01:33:44,044 --> 01:33:45,623
Nah, no thanks, babe.

790
01:33:57,141 --> 01:33:59,300
I had the most wonderful time tonight.

791
01:33:59,519 --> 01:34:01,511
Yeah, you look happy.

792
01:34:04,857 --> 01:34:07,065
What is creativity, Robert?

793
01:34:07,903 --> 01:34:09,397
What is creativity?

794
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:13,480
No, I don't mean, you know, I know
you're a writer and you're creative.

795
01:34:15,327 --> 01:34:16,905
People paint.

796
01:34:18,122 --> 01:34:19,700
But I don't paint.

797
01:34:23,169 --> 01:34:27,711
Would you consider cooking...
an art?

798
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,711
Cooking?

799
01:34:30,385 --> 01:34:33,006
Yeah. I'm trying to find something.

800
01:34:33,555 --> 01:34:37,968
You know, just something I could do.

801
01:34:38,602 --> 01:34:43,015
I don't mean i'm the only person in the world
that can do it, you know, but just...

802
01:34:43,232 --> 01:34:46,351
something that I could- something special.

803
01:34:46,568 --> 01:34:48,561
You know like cooking, or...

804
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:52,230
Writing? You could do some poetry.
Write poetry.

805
01:34:52,616 --> 01:34:55,783
No. Poetry, I love it,
but it's just so depressing.

806
01:34:56,036 --> 01:35:00,165
I always get so low.
No, I don't think that's healthy.

807
01:35:05,213 --> 01:35:07,585
I don't even know what i'm talking about.

808
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:14,886
Would love be considered an art?

809
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:18,600
Well, some people think so.

810
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:22,974
You're a writer, you're always
writing those books about sex.

811
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:27,444
Maybe you could write one about love,
I could help you with that.

812
01:35:28,863 --> 01:35:30,855
We'll see how that works out.

813
01:35:31,866 --> 01:35:33,194
I love you.

814
01:35:34,036 --> 01:35:35,660
I love you.

815
01:35:38,456 --> 01:35:41,790
I'm going to do this damned thing,
I really am.

816
01:35:42,294 --> 01:35:44,417
I'm going to find balance.

817
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:48,007
And I think you should do it too.

818
01:35:50,135 --> 01:35:52,294
I'm going to do something for you.

819
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,592
I'm going to buy you a baby.

820
01:35:58,935 --> 01:36:00,346
Really.

821
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:02,681
You really need some...

822
01:36:02,898 --> 01:36:05,569
living thing that you can love, Robert.

823
01:36:05,777 --> 01:36:10,024
It could be just a little animal that you
could take care of and kiss and sleep with.

824
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,650
Please don't.

825
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:14,822
And you'd be balanced,
i'd be balanced.

826
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:23,708
Then I can go back to being
obsessive about my family.

827
01:36:32,429 --> 01:36:33,924
You know what dad always said?

828
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,180
No, what did dad always say?

829
01:36:37,810 --> 01:36:41,226
For every problem, there is an answer.

830
01:36:44,651 --> 01:36:47,023
I'm not gonna have coffee,
i'm gonna take a bath.

831
01:36:47,237 --> 01:36:48,647
I'm gonna go right to bed.

832
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:50,737
I'm gonna get up at dawn.

833
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:53,733
Goodnight, honey.

834
01:37:27,070 --> 01:37:28,149
<i>Mother?</i>

835
01:37:29,989 --> 01:37:31,022
Are you alright?

836
01:37:31,534 --> 01:37:34,072
How can you ask me if i'm alright?

837
01:37:34,494 --> 01:37:38,159
Did you find your sex, mom?
Is that what you were looking for?

838
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:40,581
Ask your father to come to the phone.

839
01:37:40,834 --> 01:37:43,586
It's making me ill what
you're doing to dad.

840
01:37:43,796 --> 01:37:45,456
You wanted the divorce.

841
01:37:45,965 --> 01:37:48,372
Please call your father to the phone.

842
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:51,501
<i>- He's asleep.
- Wake him up.</i>

843
01:37:51,721 --> 01:37:55,848
<i>You think i'm afraid to call him.
Mother please leave him alone.</i>

844
01:37:56,976 --> 01:38:00,180
Listen to me. You do what I tell you,
and you do it right now.

845
01:38:00,397 --> 01:38:01,642
Call your father to this phone.

846
01:38:01,857 --> 01:38:05,356
<i>Alright, alright. Fine, I will.
Just hold on.</i>

847
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,540
You have no mercy.

848
01:38:27,717 --> 01:38:29,710
Alright, that's fine with me.

849
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:34,470
But you leave our kid out of this.

850
01:38:35,684 --> 01:38:38,720
This is our biggest and
it is our only problem.

851
01:38:38,937 --> 01:38:43,149
<i>Hey, i'm 13. I'm not a child, honey.
I know more than you do.</i>

852
01:38:48,196 --> 01:38:51,447
Jack, would you answer one question for me?

853
01:38:54,036 --> 01:38:57,785
Do you believe that love
is a continuous stream?

854
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:03,958
<i>Sarah, we have a little daughter
going through puberty right now.</i>

855
01:39:04,173 --> 01:39:07,007
<i>And she's more important
than you are right now.</i>

856
01:39:07,217 --> 01:39:10,751
<i>I'm not taking care of you anymore, Sarah.
We're divorced.</i>

857
01:39:17,603 --> 01:39:22,395
Please have the grace not to explain to my
sister what a divorce is. And stop lecturing her!

858
01:39:23,942 --> 01:39:28,415
Well then don't call her, and leave her alone!
You're the bitch!

859
01:39:40,293 --> 01:39:42,499
- You alright?
- I'm washing my face.

860
01:39:43,296 --> 01:39:44,838
Love is dead.

861
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,081
Love is a fantasy little girls have.

862
01:39:48,343 --> 01:39:50,300
I'm tired.
I just want to be by myself.

863
01:39:50,513 --> 01:39:53,928
How old is she? 13?
I mean, is she 13 years old?

864
01:39:54,141 --> 01:39:57,427
She's hit puberty for god's sakes.
That's whats happened to her!

865
01:39:57,646 --> 01:40:00,017
You know absolutely nothing about children.

866
01:40:00,231 --> 01:40:02,057
I don't intend to discuss my daughter with you.

867
01:40:02,274 --> 01:40:04,398
You have a husband, right?
What's he in?

868
01:40:04,611 --> 01:40:08,026
Is he in architecture? Architect, right?
He's just like me.

869
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,361
He's a guy. He's a man.
He loves women.

870
01:40:10,575 --> 01:40:13,408
- He goes out with women. He has a good time.
- You're talking about a guy...

871
01:40:13,618 --> 01:40:18,624
i've been with for 15 years, who's put food
on the table and clothes on her back.

872
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:22,373
We've had experiences of the heart
you couldn't even imagine.

873
01:40:22,587 --> 01:40:26,004
You're talking about a guy who
held my hand in the hospital,

874
01:40:26,217 --> 01:40:29,835
who cried when his baby was born.
Where were you?

875
01:41:36,206 --> 01:41:38,958
Sarah, what are all these flowers doing here?

876
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:42,536
This looks like somebody died
and went to a wake.

877
01:41:44,257 --> 01:41:46,794
Those flowers are from the garden, dummy.

878
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:48,711
I told you I was going to get you a baby.

879
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:53,092
And i'm over here at animal shelter-
Kiners something- getting you one.

880
01:41:53,309 --> 01:41:55,846
I'm gonna change your life around a little bit.

881
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:01,149
You don't like me now, but

882
01:42:01,253 --> 01:42:05,854
when I get home with what i'm gonna get
home with, you're gonna be crazy about me.

883
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,400
Was that your husband?

884
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:12,029
Your fiance?

885
01:42:14,788 --> 01:42:17,955
Well I must say i'm very curious
as to know who it was.

886
01:42:18,584 --> 01:42:21,335
That was my closest and my dearest friend.

887
01:42:22,672 --> 01:42:25,128
And he doesn't want me to buy a baby.

888
01:42:26,176 --> 01:42:29,212
- What does he want you to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

889
01:42:30,055 --> 01:42:33,553
Actually, we're both pretty screwed up.

890
01:42:34,476 --> 01:42:37,145
But I really think he's
in more trouble than I am.

891
01:42:37,688 --> 01:42:39,561
Is he a tall man or a short man?

892
01:42:40,483 --> 01:42:44,314
Listen, I better get going.
How much do I owe you for that telephone call?

893
01:42:44,653 --> 01:42:46,397
I have some bunny rabbits.

894
01:42:46,614 --> 01:42:50,611
I have a crow. A parrot.
I have a parakeet.

895
01:42:50,826 --> 01:42:52,949
A parakeet is a wonderful pet for a man.

896
01:42:53,162 --> 01:42:54,027
No thank you.

897
01:42:54,705 --> 01:42:59,865
Now, you ask, I do have the one billy goat,
which you can see he's a very handsome fellow.

898
01:43:00,628 --> 01:43:02,289
Then i've got the nanny goat,

899
01:43:02,506 --> 01:43:05,709
You like goat cheese, perfect opportunity.

900
01:43:05,926 --> 01:43:08,547
Then i've got these two ducks.

901
01:43:09,221 --> 01:43:12,222
- Sweet. And i've got the mallard over there.
- He's a handsome rooster.

902
01:43:12,432 --> 01:43:15,636
The rooster- wake you up every morning,
keep you company.

903
01:43:18,522 --> 01:43:19,897
I was thinking maybe,

904
01:43:20,107 --> 01:43:23,025
do you have any kittens, or dogs?

905
01:43:24,153 --> 01:43:26,276
I do have one dog.

906
01:43:28,241 --> 01:43:31,360
That's Lenny and that's Jim.
They are inseparable.

907
01:43:31,577 --> 01:43:33,866
They don't get much work done,
but they are the best of friends.

908
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,072
And they seem to understand each other.

909
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:41,044
No, that's a nasty dog.
I don't like that dog at all.

910
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:44,084
Well, to look at him there isn't
too much in his favor.

911
01:43:44,298 --> 01:43:45,793
No, there really isn't.

912
01:43:46,009 --> 01:43:47,966
But he is a great dog for a man.

913
01:43:48,179 --> 01:43:50,716
No, thank you.
No on that dog.

914
01:43:50,931 --> 01:43:52,425
He is so much like a man.

915
01:43:53,392 --> 01:43:58,303
And you admire, and you praise,
and the dog opens up,

916
01:43:58,522 --> 01:44:02,770
And he's a warm, wonderful
and fine human being.

917
01:44:03,027 --> 01:44:05,234
You are so strong!

918
01:44:05,946 --> 01:44:07,227
Go ahead and try.

919
01:44:08,282 --> 01:44:11,070
No, he doesn't know me.
Maybe I shouldn't.

920
01:44:11,285 --> 01:44:15,414
Jim knows Mrs. Lawson loves him,
don't you Jim?

921
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:17,866
Come on, just give it a shot.

922
01:44:18,584 --> 01:44:20,080
Don't be afraid.

923
01:44:21,296 --> 01:44:22,577
Hello, Jim.

924
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:25,339
I'm Mrs. Lawson.

925
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:29,503
Try again.
Just try slowly.

926
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,217
Don't be afraid.

927
01:44:39,983 --> 01:44:41,891
You don't want to scare me.

928
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:45,277
You're so much bigger,
and you're so strong.

929
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:47,774
And you're very handsome.

930
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:51,076
You're very handsome.
You look just like somebody that I know.

931
01:44:51,286 --> 01:44:55,331
Yes you do.
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

932
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,411
Oh, is that a good dog. Look at that.
Oh, good boy...

933
01:45:02,589 --> 01:45:05,544
He's terrific.
He's a wonderful dog.

934
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:08,677
A wonderful dog, yes you are.
Yes you are.

935
01:45:08,888 --> 01:45:11,842
You look just like somebody I know,
yeah you do.

936
01:45:12,141 --> 01:45:13,636
He is terrific.

937
01:45:13,851 --> 01:45:17,435
That's, i'm gonna take him.
That's won- I want to take him.

938
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:20,433
And we've got the parakeet.
You know what I need now,

939
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:24,268
a little something soft,
little and soft.

940
01:45:24,487 --> 01:45:25,567
Little and soft?

941
01:45:26,823 --> 01:45:28,317
Goodbye, Jim. Goodbye, Jim.

942
01:45:28,533 --> 01:45:31,653
Oh, this is terrific. This is just great.

943
01:45:32,747 --> 01:45:35,367
That's it now. Here we are home.

944
01:45:39,462 --> 01:45:42,379
Wait a minute,
can you take this one?

945
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,214
There you are, and this one.

946
01:45:44,425 --> 01:45:46,465
And then the- i'll get the-
Have you got the leash?

947
01:45:46,677 --> 01:45:49,169
I got it, I got it. Come on Rex.

948
01:45:51,558 --> 01:45:53,182
That's a wild one you got there.

949
01:45:53,392 --> 01:45:55,386
You come on a little easier.

950
01:45:55,604 --> 01:45:58,854
Here we are.
Come on, we come home now.

951
01:46:02,152 --> 01:46:05,355
Okay, now I want to show him the horses.

952
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:07,608
The chickens in the...

953
01:46:07,824 --> 01:46:09,450
Alright, can you hold the goat?

954
01:46:09,659 --> 01:46:12,697
No, i'll hold the goat,
and then you've got those still.

955
01:46:13,206 --> 01:46:16,824
What do you think, huh? Is this nice?
Is this a nice place to live?

956
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:21,046
Oh, you're such good boys, yeah.

957
01:46:22,173 --> 01:46:23,751
Alright, where's the duck now?

958
01:46:23,966 --> 01:46:25,509
The duck I don't know.

959
01:46:25,968 --> 01:46:27,795
Wait a minute.

960
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:32,506
You take that, i'll take- here,
I got the chickens.

961
01:46:32,725 --> 01:46:35,477
Can you still get the duck or shall I take...

962
01:46:35,979 --> 01:46:37,853
I'll have to come back for the duck.

963
01:46:38,065 --> 01:46:41,149
What do you think?
You like it.

964
01:46:43,779 --> 01:46:45,654
Are you good boys.

965
01:46:45,864 --> 01:46:48,189
Come on, let's go see Robert.

966
01:46:51,871 --> 01:46:55,489
I know this sounds crazy,
but I just got carried away.

967
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:58,378
I couldn't resist these...

968
01:46:58,627 --> 01:47:03,206
These are miniature horses.
Aren't they small? Aren't they?

969
01:47:03,424 --> 01:47:07,208
I was gonna only take one,
but then I figured they'd get lonely

970
01:47:07,428 --> 01:47:10,881
and if you have one,
you might as well have two.

971
01:47:12,767 --> 01:47:17,311
Anyway, the goat gives milk,
so that's not a waste.

972
01:47:17,523 --> 01:47:22,149
And the chickens and the duck
will have eggs eventually.

973
01:47:22,361 --> 01:47:26,690
And we can eat those and we'll
all live here at the park.

974
01:47:30,077 --> 01:47:31,241
Well, we'll talk about it in a minute.

975
01:47:31,454 --> 01:47:35,499
I'm gonna take these in and give
them a little food and some water.

976
01:47:35,709 --> 01:47:38,413
It was really hot coming over.

977
01:47:43,883 --> 01:47:45,793
It's going to be alright, Robert.

978
01:47:48,054 --> 01:47:50,214
I'll talk in just a minute, okay.

979
01:48:09,827 --> 01:48:12,662
- Have you got him?
- Yeah, I need a little hand with this one.

980
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:17,992
We're gonna stick you in the nice park.

981
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:27,049
Oh, you're gonna like this, you're gonna
like this, right in the shade.

982
01:48:38,232 --> 01:48:41,399
We're gonna give you nice, fresh water.

983
01:48:42,321 --> 01:48:44,029
Have you got the chickens?

984
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:45,898
Where's the duck?

985
01:48:47,409 --> 01:48:50,280
Come on, boys. Come on.
Over here.

986
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,709
There you go.

987
01:48:58,712 --> 01:49:00,540
Come on, chick-chick.
Come on, chickies.

988
01:49:00,882 --> 01:49:03,254
Come on, out you go.

989
01:49:04,926 --> 01:49:06,208
Can you get 'em?

990
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:17,103
Come on, you little rascal.

991
01:49:25,949 --> 01:49:27,693
I don't know.

992
01:49:28,534 --> 01:49:31,072
I don't know if this
is such a hot idea?

993
01:49:32,664 --> 01:49:36,793
He didn't seem too
enthusiastic about my park.

994
01:49:38,754 --> 01:49:41,839
I'm sure he thinks i'm crazy as a bed-bug.

995
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,338
What do you think?

996
01:49:49,014 --> 01:49:53,724
I'm gonna get these little guys some water,
cool 'em off a little bit.

997
01:49:59,943 --> 01:50:01,567
It's a plenty hot day.

998
01:50:12,623 --> 01:50:16,242
Come on, oh i'm gonna show you
something nice, come on.

999
01:50:20,257 --> 01:50:22,926
I'm gonna show you something
you haven't seen.

1000
01:50:23,134 --> 01:50:25,459
Gonna take you up to the high country.

1001
01:50:30,349 --> 01:50:33,136
You are such strong guys.

1002
01:50:33,436 --> 01:50:35,263
So delicate.

1003
01:50:37,692 --> 01:50:41,226
Gee, I hope i'm doing the right
thing for you fellas too.

1004
01:50:44,907 --> 01:50:48,323
Okay, just run, run. Run free.

1005
01:51:21,946 --> 01:51:24,105
Come on, Jim. This is it.

1006
01:51:40,758 --> 01:51:43,794
This is Lenny and this is Jim.

1007
01:51:46,472 --> 01:51:48,630
I need a drink.

1008
01:51:49,225 --> 01:51:50,505
Excuse me.

1009
01:51:53,938 --> 01:51:55,183
I'll take him.

1010
01:52:21,425 --> 01:52:24,545
Don't give me any trouble now,
don't give me any trouble now.

1011
01:53:01,092 --> 01:53:02,467
Dr. Williams?

1012
01:53:02,677 --> 01:53:04,384
Hi, i'm Robert Harmon.

1013
01:53:04,805 --> 01:53:07,378
So tell me, who is the patient?

1014
01:53:09,225 --> 01:53:13,685
Sarah had these two little
miniature horses,

1015
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:15,309
and a goat,

1016
01:53:15,523 --> 01:53:19,391
and she didn't know that I was
going to respond so poorly

1017
01:53:19,611 --> 01:53:21,734
when she brought Lenny and Jim over,

1018
01:53:21,947 --> 01:53:25,647
so they couldn't find the duck and
the little chicks disappeared, so...

1019
01:53:26,284 --> 01:53:29,322
Excuse me, but where is she?

1020
01:53:31,289 --> 01:53:32,749
She's in here.

1021
01:54:18,088 --> 01:54:20,710
Don't be alarmed.
I'm Dr. Williams.

1022
01:54:30,144 --> 01:54:32,516
What seems to be the trouble?

1023
01:54:35,065 --> 01:54:37,188
I don't know who I am.

1024
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:41,565
- Do you know where you are?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1025
01:54:41,822 --> 01:54:44,609
Who am I, who am I?

1026
01:54:44,825 --> 01:54:48,276
Just a minute, just a minute.
Who am I? Who am I?

1027
01:54:49,079 --> 01:54:51,571
Am I your brother?
Am I your mother?

1028
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:54,413
Am I Jim? Who am I?

1029
01:54:54,836 --> 01:54:57,160
Could you please step outside for a moment?

1030
01:54:57,379 --> 01:54:59,289
Here, take your bag.
We don't need you, alright.

1031
01:54:59,507 --> 01:55:02,130
I'll pay you your bill.
I'm sorry, goodbye, thank you.

1032
01:55:02,427 --> 01:55:04,503
Now just go.
Here is your bag, here it is.

1033
01:55:06,724 --> 01:55:08,800
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

1034
01:55:09,518 --> 01:55:10,681
Come here.

1035
01:55:13,773 --> 01:55:16,976
Mr. Harmon, I think Sarah is in trouble.

1036
01:55:17,735 --> 01:55:21,733
Her eyes are not responding the way i'd
like them to, and her neck is stiff.

1037
01:55:21,947 --> 01:55:27,025
Now, you can do what you want, but i'd like
you to get her to see somebody if it's not me.

1038
01:55:29,539 --> 01:55:31,828
She's fine... thank you.

1039
01:55:32,917 --> 01:55:36,037
You're very welcome.
I'll let myself out.

1040
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:57,645
Sarah, you're one of the greatest
people that i've ever met in my life.

1041
01:55:58,152 --> 01:56:01,319
I fed the horses.
I fed the goat.

1042
01:56:08,579 --> 01:56:11,913
You gotta get well. You're not sick.

1043
01:56:12,917 --> 01:56:17,046
I got chicken soup on and I put okra in it,
and I know you hate okra.

1044
01:56:20,008 --> 01:56:22,679
You're the best. You gotta fight it.

1045
01:56:23,303 --> 01:56:24,881
You're the best.

1046
01:56:39,112 --> 01:56:41,188
Nice hot cup of tea.

1047
01:56:43,658 --> 01:56:45,200
Come on, try this now.

1048
01:56:48,622 --> 01:56:50,827
Nice hot cup of tea, smell it.

1049
01:57:01,844 --> 01:57:03,836
You're crazy as a bed-bug.

1050
01:57:23,825 --> 01:57:27,324
You're not gonna make me laugh,
I don't have a sense of humor.

1051
01:57:27,746 --> 01:57:29,122
We'll see.

1052
01:57:32,209 --> 01:57:34,332
This is the most ridiculous,
crazy idea i've ever heard.

1053
01:57:34,545 --> 01:57:36,834
- You're pitiful.
- That's enough.

1054
01:57:37,047 --> 01:57:40,297
That is enough.
I want you to stand right there.

1055
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:43,969
I want you to look right into my eyes.

1056
01:57:44,179 --> 01:57:47,346
You hear nothing but the sound of my voice.

1057
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:51,394
Does my fox face mean anything to you?

1058
01:57:53,523 --> 01:57:54,305
Not funny.

1059
01:57:54,691 --> 01:57:56,600
Nevermind.

1060
01:57:59,738 --> 01:58:04,864
In 30 seconds, you are going
to be laughing helplessly.

1061
01:58:06,619 --> 01:58:08,115
You don't believe, huh, you wanna bet?

1062
01:58:08,706 --> 01:58:10,330
What do you bet?

1063
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,323
A dollar.

1064
01:58:12,001 --> 01:58:14,574
Oh, cheapskate. What do you bet?

1065
01:58:17,339 --> 01:58:20,839
I'm the highroller,
i'm gonna bet, i'm gonna bet...

1066
01:58:23,512 --> 01:58:26,550
Love. I'm gonna bet the ultimate, okay.

1067
01:58:28,977 --> 01:58:30,886
First of all,

1068
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:35,014
i'm going to give you a
drink of scotch and soda,

1069
01:58:35,525 --> 01:58:39,772
Want you to have a coca-cola.
Want you all to be in a very good mood.

1070
01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:43,572
But I don't care, I don't care.
I'm willing to take the chance.

1071
01:58:51,334 --> 01:58:55,201
Jack, what do you want?
Do you want mustard or ketchup?

1072
01:58:56,923 --> 01:59:01,383
Some people think that's my best joke, because
most people laugh just at the word ketchup.

1073
01:59:01,595 --> 01:59:04,715
Debbie, you open the peanut brittle, please.

1074
01:59:04,932 --> 01:59:07,802
While I show daddy this flower.

1075
01:59:08,018 --> 01:59:10,176
And here, i'm gonna put this up here.

1076
01:59:10,395 --> 01:59:14,773
Well you don't have a lapel,
but it smells nice anyway.

1077
01:59:20,698 --> 01:59:23,484
Anyway, i'm sorry, that was a dirty trick,

1078
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:25,658
i'm gonna do something nice for ya.

1079
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:28,278
You want some popcorn, sweetheart?
You want some popcorn?

1080
01:59:32,211 --> 01:59:33,490
I've got the popcorn.

1081
01:59:34,128 --> 01:59:36,501
I mean, it's real popcorn on a string.

1082
01:59:45,557 --> 01:59:48,393
How about the anniversary present?

1083
01:59:48,602 --> 01:59:51,271
Would I forget our anniversary, sweetheart?

1084
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:52,892
It's a fancy pen.

1085
01:59:57,194 --> 01:59:59,767
Debbie, you think I forgot you?
I didn't.

1086
02:00:01,366 --> 02:00:04,118
Don't think I forgot you, Debbie,
cuz I never forget you.

1087
02:00:04,327 --> 02:00:06,652
And I know that the-
or at least last week,

1088
02:00:06,871 --> 02:00:08,615
it was your graduation,

1089
02:00:08,832 --> 02:00:12,912
and I know you like pearl earrings, don't you?
Come on, you like it?

1090
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:23,376
I want to take a good look at both of you,
and I want to see what I see here.

1091
02:00:25,724 --> 02:00:27,883
I see twins, that's what I see. Twins.

1092
02:00:28,102 --> 02:00:32,978
You guys are a couple of- you really are.
A two of a pair.

1093
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:36,107
This is for us.

1094
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:38,692
Jack, this is for our old age.

1095
02:00:45,287 --> 02:00:47,494
Come over here and stand by daddy.

1096
02:00:47,706 --> 02:00:50,541
Over here, stand by dad.
I want to take your picture.

1097
02:00:51,084 --> 02:00:52,626
Mom, you're not funny.

1098
02:00:52,836 --> 02:00:57,250
Smile. Smile.
Hey Jack, look this way. Here you go.

1099
02:00:57,592 --> 02:00:59,715
That's it. Here we go.

1100
02:01:09,103 --> 02:01:11,511
Time is running up...

1101
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:19,938
Are you ready? Here it goes.
Are you ready to laugh?

1102
02:01:36,341 --> 02:01:38,333
Just go inside.

1103
02:01:42,347 --> 02:01:44,219
We gotta get to Sarah's bedroom.

1104
02:01:46,392 --> 02:01:48,266
Come on, duckies.

1105
02:02:53,546 --> 02:02:55,586
I got the horses in,

1106
02:02:56,173 --> 02:03:00,254
and I couldn't get the goat.
I mean, the goat is just impossible.

1107
02:03:00,887 --> 02:03:04,671
You know, there are secrets women have.
A young girl...

1108
02:03:04,891 --> 02:03:08,058
And she comes up to you,
she's infatuated with you,

1109
02:03:08,271 --> 02:03:10,726
she always wants to tell you her secrets,
she volunteers them.

1110
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:14,355
And she says: "I've done some nude modeling",

1111
02:03:14,568 --> 02:03:19,146
you know, so the delicate balance
of that relationship won't break.

1112
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:23,533
If you're in love with someone

1113
02:03:24,495 --> 02:03:27,531
and the woman keeps the secret,

1114
02:03:28,583 --> 02:03:31,253
doesn't give it to you,
doesn't offer it to you,

1115
02:03:31,461 --> 02:03:34,414
then that part of her is always dead to you.

1116
02:03:38,802 --> 02:03:41,554
I'm gonna get that goat.
You alright?

1117
02:03:42,055 --> 02:03:44,297
Oh good, you look wonderful.
You really do.

1118
02:03:46,518 --> 02:03:49,187
Wanna come out with me?
See the goat?

1119
02:04:47,791 --> 02:04:52,169
<i>You promised me</i>

1120
02:04:52,713 --> 02:04:57,338
<i>that I would be the only one.</i>

1121
02:05:11,858 --> 02:05:13,649
<i>How I missed you.</i>

1122
02:05:18,531 --> 02:05:20,026
<i>Mama.</i>

1123
02:05:26,707 --> 02:05:28,616
<i>In love,</i>

1124
02:05:29,918 --> 02:05:32,042
<i>i'm not sure of...</i>

1125
02:05:38,052 --> 02:05:39,843
<i>of me.</i>

1126
02:05:40,596 --> 02:05:45,258
<i>And that, i'm not sure of...</i>

1127
02:05:48,939 --> 02:05:50,433
<i>of you.</i>

1128
02:05:51,650 --> 02:05:54,188
<i>I'm not sure of love.</i>

1129
02:05:58,156 --> 02:06:00,445
<i>I'm not sure of me,</i>

1130
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:03,620
<i>of you.</i>

1131
02:06:17,635 --> 02:06:19,629
<i>Mama.</i>

1132
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:49,160
<i>Let me know.</i>

1133
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:52,037
<i>No, Debbie, don't go.</i>

1134
02:06:53,131 --> 02:06:55,123
<i>Come back, baby.
I love you.</i>

1135
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:57,461
<i>She's a killer.</i>

1136
02:06:58,219 --> 02:07:00,591
<i>You know she'll kill you.</i>

1137
02:07:26,166 --> 02:07:29,665
<i>I love that face.</i>

1138
02:07:30,378 --> 02:07:35,503
<i>And I will be the only one...</i>

1139
02:07:35,718 --> 02:07:39,133
<i>to love that face.</i>

1140
02:07:39,847 --> 02:07:41,885
<i>The only one.</i>

1141
02:07:43,767 --> 02:07:46,257
<i>You promised me.</i>

1142
02:08:09,170 --> 02:08:13,914
<i>So I love that face.</i>

1143
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:40,325
<i>I love you...</i>

1144
02:08:41,952 --> 02:08:46,331
<i>both.</i>

1145
02:09:02,266 --> 02:09:04,887
I had the most wonderful dream.

1146
02:09:07,063 --> 02:09:08,522
Where's Robert?

1147
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:46,432
Robert?

1148
02:09:59,118 --> 02:10:00,316
Are you out there?

1149
02:10:00,703 --> 02:10:04,202
I'll be right in! Don't come out here!

1150
02:10:43,998 --> 02:10:48,494
I've come to the most fantastic
new understanding with Jack.

1151
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:53,169
I've made it up with him,
and with Debbie too.

1152
02:10:56,844 --> 02:10:59,965
Talked to him on the telephone,
or you dreamt this?

1153
02:11:04,436 --> 02:11:06,144
Look, i'm not kidding around.

1154
02:11:06,354 --> 02:11:10,851
I do not want you to go to some guy
that doesn't love you.

1155
02:11:11,067 --> 02:11:14,188
I love you. And I want you to stay here.
And I want you to stay here forever.

1156
02:11:14,405 --> 02:11:17,821
I'm taking care of the animals,
i'm taking care of everything.

1157
02:11:25,416 --> 02:11:27,824
- I'm gonna get a plane tonight.
- No.

1158
02:11:35,302 --> 02:11:36,761
I have to.

1159
02:11:43,018 --> 02:11:44,430
I have to.

1160
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,594
Who the hell is that?

1161
02:13:40,684 --> 02:13:42,392
Who the fuck are you?

1162
02:14:26,774 --> 02:14:28,850
- Who are you?
- I'm Ken.

1163
02:14:37,743 --> 02:14:39,071
Hello, doggy.

1164
02:14:40,329 --> 02:14:42,405
How are ya? You're Robert?

1165
02:14:43,207 --> 02:14:45,449
- Want a drink?
- No, thank you.

1166
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:49,208
Ken, hi, how are you?

1167
02:14:50,506 --> 02:14:51,834
Thank you for coming.

1168
02:14:52,049 --> 02:14:55,668
Could you help me upstairs.
I have a whole bunch of stuff up there.

1169
02:14:56,179 --> 02:14:57,721
I really appreciate you coming.

1170
02:14:57,931 --> 02:14:59,045
I know it's a terrible night,

1171
02:14:59,265 --> 02:15:01,840
I just have so much stuff,
I don't know what to do with it.

1172
02:15:14,114 --> 02:15:18,361
That's right. Get him.
Go upstairs. Come on with me.

1173
02:15:19,286 --> 02:15:20,698
Kill the big man.

1174
02:15:28,213 --> 02:15:30,253
Speak. Speak.

1175
02:15:30,465 --> 02:15:32,256
Get him. Get him.
Come on, Jim.

1176
02:15:37,223 --> 02:15:39,049
Get the big man. Come on.

1177
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,272
Chicken shit.

1178
02:15:51,070 --> 02:15:52,694
Wanna listen to music?

1179
02:15:57,327 --> 02:15:58,951
Wanna listen to music?

1180
02:16:34,365 --> 02:16:36,026
I don't want you to go.

1181
02:16:36,784 --> 02:16:38,160
I love you.

1182
02:16:38,829 --> 02:16:40,620
You're the only one I love.

1183
02:16:41,455 --> 02:16:45,501
Don't you "shush" me. Who the hell
you think you are to "shush" me?

1184
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:50,746
I don't want you to go.
You're gonna go out in all this rain?

1185
02:16:50,966 --> 02:16:53,457
I'm gonna stay the night with Ken, okay.

1186
02:17:44,063 --> 02:17:45,095
The trunk won't fit.

1187
02:17:45,315 --> 02:17:46,643
Leave it, just leave it.
