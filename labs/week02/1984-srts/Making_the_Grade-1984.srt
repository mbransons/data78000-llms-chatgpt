00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:20,468
Woman:
Up and down these steps.

3
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:23,271
Up and down.

4
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,773
Gettin' too old.

5
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,179
Now, don't make me
come in that room.

6
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,913
Not even human.

7
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,117
Too much trouble.

8
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:45,926
Palmer?

9
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,565
Palmer, you awake
in there yet?

10
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:59,440
Palmer?

11
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,010
Palmer!

12
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,779
I haven't the time.

13
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,414
Which pile are you?

14
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,488
Mr. Townsend's
still downstairs.

15
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:19,227
He ain't gettin'
a bit happier.

16
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,428
What? I can't
understand you

17
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,996
With that thing
on your face.

18
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:24,932
Well, I can't breathe in here
with all these germs.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,001
Townsend's downstairs.

20
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,703
Oh, screw townsend.

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,171
Open a window,
will ya?

22
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,306
<i>You open a window.</i>

23
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:33,941
I ain't steppin' in this room
until it's clean.

24
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,243
Hey,
nobody said this job

25
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,777
Wasn't gonna have
its hazards.

26
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:38,079
What are we
paying you for?

27
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:40,848
I ain't paid enough
to do this job.

28
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,484
Nobody's ever been
paid enough to do this job.

29
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:45,553
How about a brewski?

30
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:47,822
Nice grab.

¶ doo doo doo- ¶

71
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,371
What the hell
are you doing here?

72
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:17,905
As your father's
special assistant-

73
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,540
You're
an ass-kissing joke.

74
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,576
And you're a lazy
self-centered twerp

75
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:23,678
And an embarrassment
to your family.

76
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:26,414
My father's not gonna like you
talking like that.

77
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,449
I'm quoting your father.

78
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,584
Oh.

79
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,953
He's telexed me from belgium
with some good news.

80
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:36,290
He's placed you
in hoover academy

81
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,058
For your final year
of prep school.

82
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,427
What?

83
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,362
I knew you'd be pleased.

84
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,330
Maybe now
you can graduate

85
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,965
Before you're older
than the faculty.

86
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,601
You know what they say
about hoover?

87
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,469
It's like going to school
in a vacuum.

88
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,872
It's the prep school
of last resorts.

89
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,674
Palmer, flunking out
of 6 schools in 3 years

90
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,510
Doesn't leave
many options.

91
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:57,011
Kids you started with

92
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,746
Are practicing
medicine now.

93
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,949
Does my mother
know about this?

94
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,318
She said maybe I shouldn't
go to school this year,

95
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,186
I should try to find myself.

96
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:08,355
You know, I have
a very delicate psyche.

97
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,791
Join me in a little canard?

98
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:10,925
Quack!

99
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:13,661
I doubt that your
mother does know.

100
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,062
She's probably
in the caribbean

101
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,499
Sunning her own
delicate psyche.

102
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,001
Let me give you
the alternative.

103
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,539
If you don't go to school
and don't graduate,

104
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,574
You will be cut off.

105
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:29,510
No trust fund,
no allowance.

106
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:31,946
You will actually
have to get-

107
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,214
And forgive me
for using the word-

108
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,651
A job.

109
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,992
Thank you.

110
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,663
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

111
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,130
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

112
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:52,199
<i>A bientot.</i>

113
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:54,602
May I take your order,
monsieur?

114
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,004
Perhaps a little electric
shock therapy, nicky.

115
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,273
You know,
I'll tell you what.

116
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,708
<i>Why don't you
hold the vin</i>

117
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,610
And give me
a couple of dogs?

118
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,078
10 years as maitre d'

119
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,547
In the best french
restaurant in town, eddie.

120
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,382
Old habits die hard,

121
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,351
And then
they may want me back.

122
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:11,853
Here's nicky,

123
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,188
Handling the books!

124
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,491
I'll tell you something
that's worse for you, eddie-

125
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:19,727
Those 2 primates dice
has got out looking for ya.

126
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,463
Uhh!

127
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:23,631
I just had to do
a little bit of,

128
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,100
Ha, relocation,
you know?

129
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,735
You wouldn't, uh...

130
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:31,271
Happen to have $3,700
I could borrow, would you?

131
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,744
Shit!

132
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:37,845
Ha ha ha ha.

133
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,324
Anytime before
halley's comet gets here.

134
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:51,559
Wanna shut up?

135
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,399
God damn it!

136
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,236
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like...

137
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,270
Yes, it is,

138
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,940
It's slicing toward
the elm trees!

139
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,742
Who are you,
curt fucking gowdy?

140
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,410
Hey, that was
your best drive today.

141
00:07:09,477 --> 00:07:11,412
Now, look, shift your weight
a little faster like this,

142
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,380
Then you'll lose that slice.

143
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:24,959
What do you say, eddie?

144
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,307
Jeez, eddie, we had
a real tough time finding you.

145
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,642
Not tough enough, huh?

146
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,045
Hey, the dice man's
really pissed at ya.

147
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,046
Ha ha ha.

148
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:46,647
Now, that's poor
dental hygiene.

149
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,215
I'll tell you what, I'll
give you this for your breath,

150
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:49,216
And you let me go.

151
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,350
Let you go?

152
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,954
And face unemployment
in these uncertain times?

153
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,223
Gimme that!

154
00:07:57,826 --> 00:07:58,826
Hey, so how's-

155
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,795
How's
the ax-murder business?

156
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,766
I don't know.

157
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,668
It's this
prep school thing.

158
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,103
It's throwing my game off.

159
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,271
I'm not psychologically
prepared to go.

160
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,474
Well, at least we can
still be roommates, you know?

161
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,909
Small compensation, rand.

162
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,176
Look, I got other plans.

163
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,512
I was supposed to leave for
europe in a couple of days.

164
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,416
Besides, hoover academy.

165
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:26,487
what do you recommend?

166
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:27,922
Lessons.

167
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,790
What club, wise-ass?

168
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:32,860
Aw, if I were you,
I'd just stick to kicking.

169
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,729
If you were me, you
wouldn't be a caddy.

170
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,063
Hold this, will you?

171
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:37,331
Yeah.

172
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:38,532
What difference does it
make to my parents

173
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,734
If I go to school
or not?

174
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,968
They never see me.

175
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:42,536
Or each other,
for that matter.

176
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,271
what a tragedy.

177
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:48,009
Ok, boys, watch this.

178
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:53,881
God damn it!

179
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,686
Get up.

180
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,591
¶ flex it ¶

181
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,295
¶ flex it ¶

182
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:12,432
¶ hard, hard,
hard, hard, hard, hard ¶

183
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,539
What, are you girls
practicing

184
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,675
For a palsy contest?

185
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,309
You make me sick,
you know that?

186
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,578
Don't wave to him.

187
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:27,081
He owes me money.

188
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,383
Hey, dice man.
The act looks great!

189
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,617
What do you think,
mook?

190
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:33,020
Eddie...

191
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:35,122
The act sucks.

192
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:39,794
Now, that's respect.

193
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:43,130
Why do I get the feeling
you've been avoiding me?

194
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:45,432
I don't know. Maybe 'cause
I've been avoiding you?

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,801
That's pretty good.

196
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,804
Not, I trust, because
of any fiscal difficulty

197
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,005
We might be having?

198
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:53,974
He bit off an ear for
a tenth of what you owe.

199
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,710
I need some more time.

200
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:56,977
You had time,
man. No, I-

201
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,112
You fucked up.

202
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,847
You're a screwup,
you know that?

203
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,349
You should not have
begun wagering.

204
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,751
So now you must pay

205
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,219
Or suffer.

206
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,288
you decide.

207
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,623
Is there a third choice?

208
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,158
Death by tire wheels.

209
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:14,128
Ha ha. Eddie,
I don't need this pressure.

210
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,496
I don't need
this small shit.

211
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:19,333
Get him outta here.
Break his legs.

212
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,935
And then get me
some pizza, ok?

213
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,870
With anchovies.

214
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,109
What are you doin'?

215
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,882
Skinny son of a bitch!

216
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,851
You wait, eddie!

217
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:40,721
You skinny son of a bitch!
I'll grab you!

218
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,851
Aw, shit!

219
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,486
Go ahead, play through,
assholes!

220
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:35,169
God damn it!

221
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:49,350
God, you know, if it wasn't
for those 7 triple bogeys,

222
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,851
I probably would have had
a pretty good round.

223
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,353
Ha ha ha.

224
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,989
You know what the joke of this
whole prep school thing is?

225
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,757
My parents won't even know
if I'm there or not.

226
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:57,925
That's what really bugs me.

227
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:58,926
Will you stop
complaining?

228
00:12:58,994 --> 00:12:59,927
I mean, being poor

229
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,161
Is worse than going
to prep school.

230
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,429
You should ask
a poor person.

231
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:03,530
Who knows
any poor people?

232
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,065
If I did, I'd hire one
to go to school for me,

233
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,300
And I'd be off to europe.

234
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,502
Yeah, now, that's the remark
of a desperate man.

235
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:09,636
Yeah, well,
I'm desperate.

236
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,340
Cheese?
Aw, yuck!

237
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:14,674
Hey, you know somethin'?

238
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,710
Nobody at the school
knows what I look like.

239
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,113
My father will be traipsing
all over the world on business,

240
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,148
And my mother
will just be traipsing.

241
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,716
Why wouldn't it work?
Pay some guy, what?

242
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,019
5, 600 bucks a month
and a bonus to graduate.

243
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,053
You said it yourself.

244
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,621
Going to school
is better than being poor.

245
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,722
Well, yeah, sure,
it's a great idea,

246
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,057
But, I mean,
where do you propose

247
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,526
To find the idiot
to do this?

248
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:37,798
So, how do you interview
a guy for a job like this?

249
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,499
What, do I send for
your school records,

250
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,534
Ask for references?

251
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,836
Hey, man, listen,
forget the red tape, ok?

252
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,471
I'm considering
a lot of other offers.

253
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,440
Yeah, you two should
exchange brain scans.

254
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:48,008
I mean,
you're both nuts.

255
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,676
Don't worry, I got an instinct
for these things.

256
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:50,677
Yeah, right.

257
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,313
Uh, I'll cover
your monthly expenses,

258
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,881
And there's a $5,000 bonus
once I get my diploma.

259
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,383
5,000 bucks?

260
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,919
All right, 10,000,
but that's it.

261
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:00,921
Once you get to hoover,

262
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:02,456
My buddy here
will show you the ropes.

263
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:03,924
He may not come
from important money,

264
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,392
But he's got
a lot of class.

265
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,161
You want
the car, too? Test spin.

266
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,895
Isn't that
a little steep?

267
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:10,664
What the hell.
I hate the color.

268
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:16,570
Eddie!

269
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:18,005
Rand: God, you almost
hit those guys!

270
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,874
Feel free to open it up,
I mean, jesus.

271
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,415
Rand: I don't know,
I don't like it.

272
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,516
You know what I mean?

273
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,018
I'm the one who's gonna
have to take the heat

274
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,987
When this eddie guy screws up,
and he's gonna screw up.

275
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,989
So, you just got to make
sure that he doesn't.

276
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,590
Look, he can't
do any worse than me.

277
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,758
I mean, 7 years, and I
still haven't graduated.

278
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:39,893
Yeah, good for you.

279
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,528
But he doesn't even fit in,
you know?

280
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:42,629
You don't even
know this guy.

281
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:44,698
He may stay a week
and decide to take off, huh?

282
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,166
Wrong.
Did you see the way

283
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:47,601
He was looking
at my porsche?

284
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,370
Besides, I don't have time
to find anybody else.

285
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,705
Hang on a second, chief.

286
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,342
Look, who else can I turn to?
You're my best friend.

287
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,577
Yeah.
I'm your only friend.

288
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,181
Now, look, as I see it,
you know, uh...

289
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,783
Everyone's getting something
out of this here but me.

290
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,952
¶ that's life,
that's what they say ¶

291
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,855
¶ you're riding- ¶

292
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,058
<i>Wrong. This is life.</i>

293
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,593
And now, he can't make it
without my help,

294
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,162
And I should get paid.

295
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,431
What?
Why not?

296
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,633
It's not like I come from
really "important money. "

297
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,202
Uhh! Uhh!

298
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,971
Look, pay me half of what
you're paying eddie.

299
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,009
Rand, you have turned
into real pond scum.

300
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,144
Yeah, well,
you better hurry up.

301
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:31,445
I'm considering
some other offers.

302
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,613
All right, all right.

303
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,349
Come on, will ya?
I haven't got all day!

304
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,483
Oh, yes, sir.

305
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,085
I can count on you,
can't I?

306
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,486
Sure. Let's...

307
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:42,189
Let's just hope
you can count on eddie.

308
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,457
Ciao, baby.

309
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,447
I hate school!
I'm not going! I won't go!

310
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:09,950
I'm gonna puke if you
make me go to school!

311
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:10,984
Good-bye,
mother, father.

312
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,119
Bye. Nice meeting you.

313
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:13,120
Good-bye.

314
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,754
Nice tennis racket, kid.

315
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,823
You won't be needing it.

316
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,267
You scratched it.

317
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:30,437
This is from abercrombie's,
and you scratched it.

318
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,840
Can you believe this cheese dip
scratched my luggage?

319
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,774
Kill him.

320
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,147
Sing it.

321
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,516
I said sing it, smack.
Sing it.

322
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,085
But I didn't memorize
it, sir. I didn't know.

323
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:47,454
You-you didn't know?

324
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,289
You didn't know?

325
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:50,790
Well, you think
you're such a big man

326
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:53,127
You didn't have to learn
the hoover fight song?

327
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:55,362
N-no, sir.
Sing it.

328
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,231
¶ hoover prep,
we are for you ¶

329
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,033
¶ proud to-to wear
the pink and green ¶

330
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:15,616
Rand: He's registered
to be here.

331
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:17,184
What's the deal? He
should be here by now.

332
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,519
Don't you have
his name or anything?

333
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,634
¶ well, baby ¶

334
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,269
¶ you got rhythm ¶

335
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,538
¶ you got style ¶

336
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,973
¶ you got it made
in the shade ¶

337
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,875
¶ oh, wow ¶

338
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:43,410
¶ take it easy ¶

339
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,912
¶ or take it slow,
don't you know ¶

340
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,450
¶ you got double trouble ¶

341
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:52,786
¶ high roller... ¶

342
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,454
Hey.

343
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:56,156
Yo, rand!

344
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:02,128
¶ ooh, a pretender ¶

345
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:03,263
¶ oh, yeah ¶

346
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:07,167
¶ well, baby ¶

347
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:09,102
¶ you got rhythm ¶

348
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,271
¶ you got style ¶

349
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,773
¶ you got it made
in the shade ¶

350
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,942
¶ oh, wow ¶

351
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,211
¶ take it easy ¶

352
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:19,680
¶ or take it slow,
don't you know ¶

353
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,251
¶ you got double trouble ¶

354
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,885
¶ you got rhythm ¶

355
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:28,488
¶ you got style ¶

356
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:31,592
¶ you got it made
in the shade ¶

357
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:32,826
¶ oh, wow ¶

358
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,060
¶ take it easy ¶

359
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,263
¶ or take it slow,
don't you know ¶

360
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,967
¶ you're in
double trouble ¶

361
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:50,977
¶ shoop shoop ¶

362
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:53,280
Eddie: Ohh!

363
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:56,250
You actually paid
for this room?

364
00:18:56,317 --> 00:19:00,554
Ha. You actually paid
for those clothes?

365
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:01,888
What's wrong
with these clothes?

366
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:06,360
Well, you must be
palmer woodrow.

367
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:09,162
My name's bif.
Skip. Reggie.

368
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,631
Great names.

369
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:12,832
Wish I had a name
like bif.

370
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,735
Yeah, can't get depressed
with a name like that.

371
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:15,969
I mean, it doesn't
sound right to say,

372
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:19,373
"gee, bif, what's wrong?
Are you depressed?"

373
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,374
Great names.

374
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,041
And if I may say,

375
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,378
That is a great outfit,
woodrow.

376
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,480
We were admiring it
when you came in.

377
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:29,048
That is genuine ban-lon,
isn't it?

378
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:32,452
Uh, very nice. It almost
feels like something real.

379
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,620
Boy: Ha ha ha ha.

380
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,855
Gosh, I-I really hate
to bring this up,

381
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:38,558
But, uh, rand, did you tell
woodrow that he's a smack?

382
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,327
Oh, he's a senior.
He's a senior, bif.

383
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,328
What's a smack?

384
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,429
He's still new.

385
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,030
What's a smack?

386
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:47,100
Smack's a freshman
or-or any new kid.

387
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:50,470
Right. Now, blimp here,
well, blimp's a senior,

388
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:53,507
But he's also
the floor demo model.

389
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:54,775
Hit it, blimp.

390
00:19:57,545 --> 00:19:58,712
Boy: Ha ha.

391
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:03,350
That'll be all.

392
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,520
Now, smacks must come
to attention like that

393
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:07,921
Whenever a senior passes,

394
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:13,593
And a smack must always be
prepared to sing a song.

395
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:15,195
You do know the song?

396
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,441
It's your first day.
We're gonna let it go.

397
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:30,410
But you teach him, rand.
It's on your shoulders.

398
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,614
Good to see you again,
bif. See you, buddy.

399
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:35,816
I'll be talking
to you guys later.

400
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:37,818
What the hell
were you doing?

401
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,286
I mean, you are supposed
to be palmer woodrow.

402
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,056
You're supposed to fit in and
lose your stupid personality.

403
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:44,524
You are supposed
to be a preppy,

404
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:46,993
Or else we can kiss
our money good-bye.

405
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,729
<i>Oh, our money?</i>

406
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:51,030
Yes, yes. I have a stake
in this, too, all right?

407
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:53,333
And you're gonna fit in,
because I'm not gonna lose it,

408
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:54,801
Nor am I gonna take
any crap from you

409
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,103
When you screw up.

410
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,673
Now, I'm allergic to cancer,
so quit smoking.

411
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:03,076
Rand:
All right, lesson one-

412
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,645
Preppy-come-lately,

413
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,247
Preppy-come-never,

414
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:08,682
Preppy-forever.

415
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,885
Socks-wear them
only to weddings,

416
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,754
And then, well,
only if it's your own.

417
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:16,155
This duck is preppy,
all right?

418
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,593
This duck is not.

419
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,530
This woman is preppy.

420
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:24,731
Thank you very much.

421
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,202
This man is not.

422
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,805
Thank you. Ugh.

423
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,340
Come on. Don't roll cigarettes
up in your sleeve.

424
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,943
Learn to love
yellow and pink.

425
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,013
A tie's knot should never
be bigger than your head.

426
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,716
Clothes, they should look
like you inherited them

427
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,818
From your older brother.

428
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,952
Oh, very nice.

429
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,321
Pants-now they should
look like you outgrew them

430
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:49,856
Last year.

431
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,257
Eddie: Preppies
must get beat up a lot.

432
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,358
Rand:
Are you listening to me?

433
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,160
Wear as many layers
as possible,

434
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:57,464
But not enough to remind you
you have any armpits.

435
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:58,665
You look great.

436
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,934
Things should look neat
but never new, all right?

437
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:04,971
Isn't this
a great store?

438
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:05,972
I mean,
you should be proud.

439
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,206
Today we single-handedly

440
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,976
Destroyed the polyester
industry. Ha ha ha.

441
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,488
Uh, now, that's not
very preppy.

442
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,990
Well, men...

443
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:26,660
Ha ha!
And-and I call you men

444
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,294
Because that's exactly
what you are

445
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:31,364
When you register as seniors
here at hoover academy.

446
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,067
One of you sitting here
is gonna be the recipient

447
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:37,571
Of this year's annual
hoover memorial award.

448
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:41,808
The symbol of academic
and social achievement.

449
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:44,511
I-I ask you, men,
isn't that exciting?

450
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:49,048
I-I find it exciting.

451
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:52,251
As exciting as the sense
of tradition and honor

452
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,454
That the name hoover
embodies.

453
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:57,757
Sounds like
coach wordman.

454
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:00,393
Wordman: I have got tattoos
you wouldn't believe,

455
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:01,795
In uncharted regions.

456
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,630
hello!

457
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:04,898
What's going on here?

458
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,800
Harriman: I'm welcoming
the seniors.

459
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:07,968
What's going on there?

460
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:09,402
Is it September already?

461
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,704
Sir, excuse me,

462
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:14,307
<i>But this is the proctor
for the senior dorm?</i>

463
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,309
Why, he's not setting
a very good example.

464
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:17,978
I totally agree with you.

465
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,813
I don't think you
understand, sir.

466
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,414
These ladies' car
ran out of gas.

467
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,416
I'm merely letting them
use my phone.

468
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:24,751
Let's have a little bit
of compassion.

469
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,119
What do you think
these are?

470
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:27,587
I'm just filling them up
with gasoline

471
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:28,755
To bring back to the car.

472
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:31,825
Ahem, but now that I see
these ladies in the light,

473
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,161
I realize they are not women
of high moral integrity.

474
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:37,296
A couple of woof-woofs.

475
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:39,232
So let's get out of here
right now, please.

476
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:45,104
Perhaps I should be sure

477
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:47,073
That they are removed
from the premises, sir.

478
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:48,107
Hurry back.

479
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:49,342
I'm gonna have to.

480
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,578
I've only got about 11 minutes
left on my hour. Great.

481
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,580
Hey, wait, wait.
Wait, let me help.

482
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,248
Wait a minute. You're not
going anywhere, young man.

483
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,150
Just sit down, mr., uh...

484
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,785
Woodrow, woodrow,
palmer woodrow.

485
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:00,820
Look, it's my only
ride into town.

486
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:03,256
You're not
going into town.

487
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:06,760
Why? Or you're gonna
have girls come here?

488
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,795
'cause this place,
it's very nice,

489
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,163
But it's very boring.

490
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,568
This is an all-boys
preparatory school, mr. Woodrow.

491
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,677
Boy: First call
for breakfast!

492
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:27,380
First call for breakfast!

493
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:30,383
First call
for breakfast!

494
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:32,185
Let's go, this is it.

495
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,987
First day.

496
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,522
We got 20 minutes
to shower and dress.

497
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,861
Wake me when it's
first call for lunch.

498
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,329
Ohh. Ohh!

499
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,007
Oh, thorndike.

500
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,742
Good to
see you. Good to see you.

501
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,244
What do you think of this
fall weather we're having?

502
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:58,411
No, I don't like it.

503
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:59,545
I bought this for you.

504
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:00,713
It's
the weirdest color-

505
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,453
Come on.

506
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:09,389
Wow. Did you see that?

507
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,928
I'm sorry,
I don't see anybody.

508
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:16,897
We're gonna be late.
Come on.

509
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,836
Now, uh, take out
your homework

510
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,438
And-and pass it
to the front.

511
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,543
Excuse me,
professor mueller,

512
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,679
But this is
the first day of class.

513
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,747
You haven't assigned
any homework yet.

514
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,883
Ah, yes, of course.

515
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,085
You seem to have some papers
in your hand.

516
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:41,554
Perhaps you'd like
to pass them out?

517
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,589
Ah. Ah.

518
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:46,026
Oh, yes. Of course.

519
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:50,964
Of course.

520
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:52,232
Now,
what you have there

521
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,667
Is a-a psychological
profile.

522
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:56,837
Uh, fill it out.

523
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:59,605
Then write an essay
about yourself.

524
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:02,408
How do you spell
"parole"?

525
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,878
There are no right or
wrong answers. Simple.

526
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:08,548
A child could do it.

527
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:10,583
Boy: Uh, lookit.

528
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:13,920
I think this guy's
getting ready to blast off.

529
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,389
Hey, guys, guys.
Excuse me here.

530
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:17,523
I find this
embarrassing

531
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,860
That we cannot show
more respect

532
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:22,628
To a teacher
than this.

533
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:25,832
Sir, on behalf of
hoover academy,

534
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,734
Well, I apologize.

535
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,970
Boy: Yeah, me, too.

536
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:41,147
Now, unless all overhead
is dramatically curbed

537
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:44,918
Or there's a marked increase
in alumni contributions,

538
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:48,088
Hoover academy faces
financial disaster.

539
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:49,655
What overhead?

540
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:52,825
My family gave the land
and built most of the buildings.

541
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:56,496
You haven't even changed
a light bulb in 10 years.

542
00:26:56,563 --> 00:27:00,300
Do you have any idea what
a financial challenge it is

543
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,801
Running this institution?

544
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,703
Well, if it's
that much of a challenge,

545
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:05,872
Why don't you just
close the doors?

546
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,207
Well, I...
I-I-I-

547
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:09,309
I'm afraid I must
agree with mother.

548
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,444
Our family has invested
more than its fair share

549
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:12,445
In the school.

550
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:15,282
It's time the burden
was shared by others.

551
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,285
Well, yeah,
I quite agree, but-

552
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:20,520
Well, then
do something about it.

553
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:22,822
Hoover prep
can always become

554
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,824
Hoover village
condominiums.

555
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,395
Uh...

556
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:32,465
Well, uh-

557
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,634
Ok, everybody
get their overcoats.

558
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,636
Woman in film:
Come to me.

559
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:38,204
Ok.

560
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:41,908
<i>Now what we have here is
the fame masked intruder.</i>

561
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:44,644
Come to me.
Take me.

562
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:48,848
Hey. Come on.

563
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,783
4 bucks.
Take a seat down front.

564
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,053
2 bucks?

565
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,988
Cover one eye.

566
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:58,425
Ok. What can we
learn from this?

567
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,360
Well, height obviously
has nothing to do

568
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,828
With genital size.

569
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:02,929
Or shape.

570
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,864
All right, you guys,
what's going on in-

571
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,433
Woman: Come on.

572
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,868
Oh, my god.

573
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:12,805
Coach.
That's 4 bucks.

574
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:14,907
No, no. I'm not enrolled
in this course.

575
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,908
I'm only auditing.

576
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:16,977
All right, guys,
move over.

577
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,515
Oh, god,
that's wonderful.

578
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,750
Now it's time
to rate the date.

579
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,420
Woman:
like that!

580
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:31,091
Sir, I'm very, very sorry
to disturb you like this,

581
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:33,926
And, well,
you know how much I hate

582
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:36,729
To inform
on a fellow student,

583
00:28:36,797 --> 00:28:40,467
But I feel the reputation
of the hoover academy

584
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,968
Is at stake here.

585
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:44,504
Oh, boy.

586
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,940
Uh, thomas?

587
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:51,177
You gave them a 7.

588
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:53,413
Now, why did you
give them a 7?

589
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,616
7? 7, what,
are you nuts?

590
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:58,218
How old
are you, kid?

591
00:28:58,285 --> 00:28:59,785
14.

592
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:02,255
Oh. No,
that was a 9.

593
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,256
Take my word
for it.

594
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,457
That was a 9.

595
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:10,963
Harriman: All right,
what's going on here, huh?

596
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,133
A national geographic film?

597
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,334
You guys can't kid me!

598
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:15,668
Now, let's get up
and out of here.

599
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:16,702
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

600
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,704
All of yas, up,
come on, move.

601
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:20,540
I am surprised at you.

602
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,142
I expected a little
more out of you.

603
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,676
Get out of here.

604
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:24,777
What kind of
behavior is th-

605
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:28,614
They told me it was a
national geograph-kids.

606
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:38,591
Rand: Jeez, you know,
harriman can just suspend you,

607
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,093
So please shape up.

608
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,261
I don't know what
you're so worried about.

609
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:44,364
I'm-I'm a hit! A hit!

610
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:45,631
People are noticing me!

611
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,200
Yeah, but you see,
that's my whole point.

612
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:48,901
I mean, the perfect credo's
not to be noticed,

613
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,136
To have a sense of,
I don't know,

614
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,204
Discipline or tradition.

615
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,273
Woodrow, how you doin'?

616
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,243
There's a muffy newhouse
looking for you.

617
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,611
What's a muffy?

618
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,381
You know muffy.
You know... Muffy.

619
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,416
Yeah. Muffy.

620
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:05,385
Now, this is palmer's
longtime girlfriend.

621
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,453
You gotta be careful, ok?

622
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,587
Don't worry. Ok?

623
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:09,322
Well, just watch
what you say, all right?

624
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:13,259
Yo, muffy.

625
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:16,229
Yo. Pardon me.

626
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:19,332
Nice car. Did you
buy this new?

627
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,302
Are you trying to be amusing?
Whoever you are.

628
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:26,172
Bif.

629
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,607
Bif hamilton.

630
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:30,910
Well, fetch palmer
for me, bif.

631
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:33,513
This is just the most
wonderful surprise for him-

632
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,516
Me stopping by on my way
to mount hollyhock.

633
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,384
Well, actually,

634
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,953
Palmer has a most wonderful
surprise for you.

635
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,455
You see, he's not here.

636
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:45,057
He left campus
for a little while.

637
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:46,058
Damn.

638
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:48,794
You tell him
I was here.

639
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:51,864
Which is where
I expect him to be

640
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,234
The next time
I come through.

641
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,173
Man: Hey, slow down, jack.
Don't litter on campus.

642
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,642
Coach: Let's go, you guys!

643
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:05,578
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

644
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,481
If I can stand a regiment,
so can you.

645
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:13,186
Let me have a beer.

646
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:14,521
You kiddin'?
Get back in there.

647
00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:16,389
You're in rotten shape
for a teenager.

648
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,025
Well, you're in pretty rotten
shape for a phys ed instructor.

649
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:22,662
You kiddin'? I'm in rotten
shape for a human.

650
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,030
It's not my fault, though.

651
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:26,732
I was born before
jogging was invented.

652
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,603
What is your story?

653
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:34,073
You're not exactly
mr. Alligator shirt.

654
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:35,841
No story.

655
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:37,743
You remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age.

656
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,847
You remind me
a lot of myself now.

657
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:46,186
Look, get back in there.
Do, uh...

658
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:47,887
Do one of somethin'.

659
00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:58,130
Great. Hit the showers.
Yo, palmer.

660
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,403
You guys disgust me!

661
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:07,006
Hello, pizzas-are-us?

662
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:10,009
Yes, do you have
volume discounts?

663
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:11,611
Oops. Nope.
No points, no points.

664
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,745
Oh, come on.

665
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,780
I told you. You get one
point for a direct hit.

666
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,616
You get 2 points
if you draw blood.

667
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,084
You just grazed him.
It doesn't count.

668
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:19,085
All right.

669
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:20,019
Ok, watch this. The pro.

670
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,826
All right. What is this?
Bowling for dullards?

671
00:32:28,195 --> 00:32:30,963
You guys pickin' on
the blimp again? Nice.

672
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,099
Oh, no, coach, we're
not pickin' on him.

673
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,934
We just want him
to feel wanted.

674
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:35,935
Right, blimp?

675
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:38,371
Oh, sure, yeah.
This is the very reason

676
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,607
Why god created fat,
neurotic adolescents.

677
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:42,642
Right, coach?

678
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,680
Blimp: Aah!
2 points.

679
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,616
I apologize, sir,

680
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:52,685
But contemporary
psychologists agree

681
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:55,455
That this type of eye-hand
coordination exercise,

682
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:56,456
It's very-

683
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:57,823
Hamilton!

684
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,626
Staple it shut, huh?

685
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:03,496
All right, you guys.
Gather around.

686
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,798
A word to you
party animals

687
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,301
About the misspent
mixer coming up-

688
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:09,335
No drinking.

689
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:13,339
No necking.
All: Aw!

690
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:14,507
No mooning.

691
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,541
No fun.

692
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,842
No kidding.

693
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,814
Coach: All right, guys.
A few last-minute tips.

694
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:24,517
When you meet a girl,
compliment her.

695
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,321
And nothin' obvious like,
"wow, nice dress. "

696
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,222
Say something different.

697
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,257
When you say
somethin' different,

698
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,058
They think you mean it.

699
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:35,495
Also, use her name a lot.

700
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:36,929
Girls really
get off on that.

701
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:37,997
With a line like...

702
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:40,533
"gee, muffy, I really
like your panty-hose,"

703
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,801
That'll work out
great, right?

704
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:45,004
You get that far,
you don't need a line.

705
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,540
You should start looking
for signs of arousal.

706
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,108
What signs?

707
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:51,010
Ripping off their panties.

708
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:54,514
Yeah, there's a hint.
Also, nipples.

709
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,016
They're a dead giveaway.
They're kind of like

710
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,820
The plastic tab
on a purdue chicken.

711
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,356
Pop up to let you know
when they're ready.

712
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:04,757
Ha ha ha.

713
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,660
Coach, they've got medicine
for that, you know.

714
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:08,894
What?

715
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:10,596
Well, whatever it is you're
trying to kill down there.

716
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,900
All right. All right, guys.

717
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,235
In a few minutes,
you're gonna line up

718
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:18,404
To meet your hostess
of the evening.

719
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:22,408
Be polite. Be gentlemen.
No pushing, no shoving.

720
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,577
Take the girl
that they assign to you

721
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,946
No matter what
she looks like.

722
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:30,082
Remember, dogs
have feelings, too.

723
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:33,419
All right.
Now, let's go, huh?

724
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:39,559
Coach: Let's go!

725
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:57,510
I hate these things.

726
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,211
Why do I even
come to these things?

727
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,347
The whole thing makes me
stinkin' nauseous.

728
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:03,249
All right.
How do I look?

729
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:05,284
Aah!

730
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:13,125
I'm out of position.
Wonderful. Great.

731
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,427
Every time.

732
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,868
Oh, wow.

733
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:49,462
Hi. I'm palmer woodrow.
How's tricks?

734
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,763
How's tricks?

735
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,264
What happened back there?
I believe that I was-

736
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:55,435
Let's talk bottom line.
I'm in love with you.

737
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:58,070
No, actually, you're not.
You just think you are.

738
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:00,039
It comes from living
in an all-male dorm.

739
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:01,240
Oh? You lived in one?

740
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,175
Well, yeah, I used
to work for the cia,

741
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,144
But... What?

742
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:06,111
Rand.

743
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:10,149
Wow. What is it?

744
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:12,117
I was complimenting
my date.

745
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,185
Uh-huh.

746
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:18,057
I said, "hey,
what a great mole. "

747
00:36:18,124 --> 00:36:20,225
Oh, blimp, you didn't.

748
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:21,828
And she got pissed.

749
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,195
What do you expect?

750
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:24,931
Well, now what do I do?

751
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,499
Well, I don't know.
Don't-look,

752
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:28,067
Don't ask me.
Go ask coach, all right?

753
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,902
Go on.
Blimp: All right.

754
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,240
No, thanks.

755
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:46,986
¶ ooh, my little pretty one,
my pretty one ¶

756
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:50,857
¶ when you gonna give me
some time, sharona? ¶

757
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:54,393
¶ ooh, you make my motor run,
my motor run ¶

758
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:58,163
¶ got me comin' off
of the line, sharona ¶

759
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:02,969
¶ runnin' down the length
of my thigh, sharona ¶

760
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:08,173
It's a little bit on
the hawaiian punch side.

761
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:11,410
So, you're tracy hoover?

762
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:14,213
Are you related
to the school or something?

763
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Or something.

764
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:17,617
My great-grandfather
founded it.

765
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:20,386
Yeah? That's too bad he didn't
found it someplace warmer.

766
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,088
Well, I guess
he wasn't thinking.

767
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:25,958
Well, that's ok. It happens
to me sometimes, too, you know.

768
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,795
You're gonna
think I'm crazy.

769
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:31,063
No, never.

770
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:32,264
Wait, you haven't
heard it yet.

771
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:35,668
It's like this. I mean,
the first moment I saw you,

772
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,670
I mean, it was wow!

773
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:40,840
I was nailed.
Gone. Dead.

774
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,875
I didn't even know you,
and you're breakin' my heart.

775
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:45,678
I'm flattered, I think.

776
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:46,812
Well, you should be,

777
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,381
'cause I've only felt
that way about pia zadora.

778
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,588
Excuse me.
I believe there was

779
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:57,757
Some sort of confusion
on the line, woodrow.

780
00:37:57,824 --> 00:38:00,159
You see, daphne here
was to be your escort,

781
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:01,961
And tracy was to be mine.

782
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,964
Believe me,
there was no confusion.

783
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,101
Everything is copacetic.
Let's dance.

784
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,804
Just don't look at me.

785
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,309
¶ ooh, my little pretty one,
my pretty one ¶

786
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:21,013
¶ when you gonna give me
some time, sharona? ¶

787
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,617
¶ ooh, you make my motor run,
my motor run ¶

788
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:28,821
¶ got me comin'
off of the line, sharona ¶

789
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:45,071
So, what's the story
with you and bif?

790
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:46,538
We date. Why?

791
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,373
Oh, yeah?

792
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,710
Do you enjoy
dating boring guys?

793
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:54,680
Where did they get
these morticians from?

794
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:58,517
Hey, you guys know anything
from the 20th century?

795
00:38:58,585 --> 00:38:59,919
All right.

796
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:03,856
Break time!

797
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,992
Band member: 1, 2...

798
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:08,160
1, 2, 3!

799
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,685
That's right.
He's my best friend.

800
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,320
He learned it
from me. Uh-huh.

801
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:36,522
Come on, tracy,
what do you say?

802
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:37,523
Why don't we
get out of here?

803
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,624
I've got a little
cold pheasant,

804
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,225
Some champagne
in the car.

805
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,227
No, no. Not now.

806
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:45,531
¶ I said there's something
I was bound to do ¶

807
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:49,468
Look at him. He's really
terrific, isn't he?

808
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:53,973
Tracy, I just bought
the new neil diamond tape.

809
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:58,277
¶ ooh, you got me, yeah ¶

810
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:00,746
¶ ooh, I'm yours ¶

811
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:04,449
¶ ooh,
you can't stop me, girl ¶

812
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:10,756
¶ you're so sexy,
you're really cool ¶

813
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:33,512
This man is gonna
wrinkle his clothes.

814
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,119
All right, palmer!

815
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:43,455
What are you guys doin'?
I can't see!

816
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:44,724
Come on! Come back!

817
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,640
I can't see anything.
Look, will you just give me 'em?

818
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:04,409
Oops. Oh, come on,
rand. Dunk for 'em.

819
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:05,811
Come on.
Look...

820
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:08,680
Ha ha ha!

821
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:10,850
You geeks dunk for them.

822
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,752
Oh, buzz off,
palmer.

823
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:14,419
Or do you want
to dunk for 'em?

824
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:16,655
Sure.

825
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,758
Oh, right.
Captain flashdance.

826
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,459
¶ dum, dum, dum,
to the rescue ¶

827
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:21,727
¶ dum, dum,
dum, dum ¶

828
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,132
You have had it,
buddy!

829
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,332
Get him!
Get him!

830
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,770
Hey, you know,
no one's ever really

831
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:32,671
Stuck up for me
like that before.

832
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:35,374
Thanks.

833
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:37,342
Was that part of
the preppy credo, too?

834
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:39,945
Come on.

835
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:41,346
God...

836
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:44,449
That palmer
is such an ass.

837
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:50,823
Harriman: When you
attend a function,

838
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,158
Like that dance last night,

839
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:53,759
You don't just
represent yourself,

840
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:55,094
You represent
hoover academy,

841
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:58,030
Which made your actions
even that much more offensive.

842
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,365
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

843
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,635
You're all dismissed,
except for you, mr. Woodrow.

844
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:06,505
Well, it hasn't
taken you long

845
00:42:06,572 --> 00:42:09,675
To become a disruptive
element around here, has it,

846
00:42:09,742 --> 00:42:11,010
Mr. Woodrow?

847
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:13,645
Well,
I'm a fast worker.

848
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:15,281
Do you get
cable here?

849
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:18,150
'cause look. Whoa.
A lot of snow here.

850
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:20,619
I mean, it must
be the antenna.

851
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:22,087
You're testing me,
right? Huh?

852
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:24,489
Want to find out how
far your boundaries go?

853
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:26,892
And how far
you can push. You see?

854
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
Yeah, I know
about those things.

855
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:30,595
So, let me
give you an answer.

856
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:32,798
You can't push too far,
so straighten up,

857
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:34,499
Because right now
your toe's on the line

858
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:37,102
With old darby harriman
here. Out.

859
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:44,276
Rand: Look, if you
impress tracy enough

860
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,777
To be invited
to the hoover ball,

861
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,479
You better
learn from the master

862
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:48,680
How to behave.

863
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:50,449
That's great. Now watch.

864
00:42:52,085 --> 00:42:54,786
You have to walk the right way
in a dinner jacket, all right?

865
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,824
Yeah, that's it.
That's good.

866
00:42:58,892 --> 00:43:01,093
That's good, too, blimp.
All right.

867
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,997
Oh, that's great.
You see how he did it?

868
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,066
I mean, you don't just,
like, stick it in your face,

869
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,268
Light it, and suck.
You gotta have style with it.

870
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,070
Yeah, like that.
That's good.

871
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:31,891
Bartender:
May I help you, sir?

872
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,259
Chivas and soda, please.

873
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:35,794
You look
like a chivas man.

874
00:43:35,862 --> 00:43:38,497
Nothing for me.
I don't indulge.

875
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:41,100
Well, mr. Woodrow,
I've read about your father.

876
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,468
He's somewhat of an
industrial mystery man,

877
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:44,469
Isn't he?

878
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:46,171
Well, he is
to me, sir.

879
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,508
Say, did you
tie this thing?

880
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:53,012
Wow! You did!
That's a bitch.

881
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:54,713
You ought to invest
in one of these.

882
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:55,981
It's only
a few dollars,

883
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,582
But it's
well worth it, sir.

884
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:07,226
Proves my point.
Money can't buy breeding.

885
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:09,728
I'd say you can't
rent it, either.

886
00:44:10,863 --> 00:44:12,697
Excuse me, madam.

887
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:15,167
Wonderful gathering.
Wonderful gathering.

888
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:17,736
Hi.
Hi.

889
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:21,273
Your father talks great.
Is he a foreigner?

890
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:23,575
Uh, no.
Close, though.

891
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:24,977
He did go to harvard.

892
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,347
Eddie: Great ducks.

893
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,614
You like them?

894
00:44:29,682 --> 00:44:31,783
Those are the famous
peabody ducks.

895
00:44:31,851 --> 00:44:33,018
They live upstairs
on the roof,

896
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:34,186
And every morning,
they come down

897
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,421
To play
in the fountain.

898
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,365
Hey, yo, duck.
Are you preppy or regular?

899
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:51,236
Quack! God,
these things are so cute.

900
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:54,673
Oh, they're even cuter
with a bing cherry sauce.

901
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,674
What's wrong, woodrow?

902
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,410
The bowling leagues
didn't meet tonight?

903
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:01,746
Bif. Palmer, we're going
up to the ballroom now, ok?

904
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:13,092
Mother.

905
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,293
Go ahead on up.
I'll be right up.

906
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,698
Could you please
take this?

907
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:25,804
Hey!

908
00:45:30,843 --> 00:45:33,245
Hey. If it makes you
feel any better,

909
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,381
You're not the first
person to do that.

910
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:36,982
Well, it doesn't.

911
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,986
Why don't you go up
with your friends?

912
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:41,987
Why?

913
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:44,023
Because I'm not going
upstairs like this

914
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,324
And be the party dork.

915
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:50,396
Ah. Well, it is gonna
be pretty boring.

916
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,666
I really don't feel
like going up myself.

917
00:45:54,734 --> 00:45:58,237
It is a shame to waste
all these nice clothes.

918
00:45:58,304 --> 00:46:02,207
Come on. Why don't we do
something really elegant?

919
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,609
Yeah.

920
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:15,954
I love this kind
of food,

921
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:17,689
'cause you never
have to clean up.

922
00:46:17,757 --> 00:46:18,924
I don't have to clean up.

923
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,563
What does yours say?

924
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,997
"oh, a-boy,

925
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:29,234
A-you are going
to a-score tonight. "

926
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:31,903
Mine says,

927
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:33,272
"oh, a-boy,

928
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:37,242
Is this guy you're with
a dreamer or what?"

929
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,410
What.

930
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,683
You know, you don't seem
like a palmer woodrow.

931
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,418
What does that mean?

932
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:47,586
You know.

933
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:49,354
palmer woodrow.

934
00:46:49,422 --> 00:46:52,958
It's just too stuffy
for words.

935
00:46:53,025 --> 00:46:54,726
you're not like that.

936
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:56,462
You're...

937
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:57,929
Human?

938
00:46:57,997 --> 00:46:59,731
Yeah.

939
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:03,702
Well, palmer woodrow
is my nickname.

940
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,971
Eddie is my real name.

941
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:08,006
Eddie?

942
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:13,312
Well, actually, um,
eddie's my middle name.

943
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:17,449
Palmer "eddie" woodrow?

944
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:19,184
I think I'll
call you palmer.

945
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:20,185
Besides, I don't
think my parents

946
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:21,653
Would let me
date an eddie.

947
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,688
Would they let you
kiss one?

948
00:47:42,808 --> 00:47:44,276
Mr. Hoover:
Mr. Woodrow.

949
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:48,780
I think we've seen quite
enough of you tonight.

950
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:56,221
Bif: Well,
you know how I hate

951
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:58,023
To talk about
a fellow student, sir,

952
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,527
But, uh,
it's palmer woodrow.

953
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:02,961
Get to the point,
hamilton.

954
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:05,930
He's just not our kind.

955
00:48:05,998 --> 00:48:07,266
And it pains me

956
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,434
To see the hoover image
stained like this.

957
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:11,770
Stained?

958
00:48:11,837 --> 00:48:12,771
Stained.

959
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:14,206
Besmirched.

960
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:17,209
Especially when hoover's
in such need of contributions.

961
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,679
Why, when I told my father
what happened last night,

962
00:48:20,746 --> 00:48:22,181
He said he didn't know
if he could support a school

963
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:24,149
That would tolerate
a palmer woodrow.

964
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:27,219
All right, hamilton,
what did happen last night?

965
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:30,889
Well, gosh, sir,
I hate to, uh...

966
00:48:30,956 --> 00:48:33,124
Hamilton!

967
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:34,560
Woodrow got
very drunk last night

968
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:36,261
At the, uh,
hoover charity ball.

969
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:39,398
He humiliated the students
and the hoovers.

970
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:42,267
Believe me, sir, all the hoovers
want to see him out.

971
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,142
Come on!
Get out of there!

972
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,178
Would you-
move over to the-

973
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:00,219
Stupid game.

974
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,889
Mccrowsky, get over here!
Right there!

975
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:07,226
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Get back to the bench!

976
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:09,695
Come on, we've got it!

977
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:13,599
Attention! Attention!
You guys suck!

978
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,503
Hoover! Hoover! Hoover!

979
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,439
What the hell
is woodrow doing?

980
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:26,211
Diversionary tactic, sir?

981
00:49:28,314 --> 00:49:29,348
Hey!

982
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:46,765
He's crazy.

983
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:48,099
He's cute, though.
Yeah.

984
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:49,534
He's real cute.

985
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:51,637
She's got her eye
on palmer.

986
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:52,971
Look at that ass
woodrow.

987
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:54,740
Get-what are you
doing with that?

988
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:56,675
All right,
get in there.

989
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,411
And try not to
fall down again.

990
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:01,546
Aah!

991
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:06,985
Eddie: Yo!

992
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,220
Let's show him some fancy
stick work, huh?

993
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,163
Wise up, asshole.

994
00:50:32,412 --> 00:50:33,478
Isn't this
a terrific surprise?

995
00:50:33,546 --> 00:50:35,447
Muffy drove all the way
from mount hollyhock.

996
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,649
Shame she missed palmer,
huh?

997
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,951
So, uh, we'll entertain her.
What do you say, buddy?

998
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:41,886
Poor baby.

999
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,922
God, you have
terrible posture.

1000
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:46,625
I'm always telling palmer
to stand up straight.

1001
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,399
You take it easy, buddy.
See you later?

1002
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,741
Look...

1003
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,743
I want to explain
about that girl.

1004
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:08,213
Ha. There's
no explanation needed.

1005
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,614
I just didn't think
she was your type.

1006
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:10,749
She's not.

1007
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,851
You are.

1008
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:15,887
Look, I-I want to
go out with you tonight.

1009
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:17,055
well, I'm busy.

1010
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:18,423
Come on, let's go.

1011
00:51:21,427 --> 00:51:22,561
Forever?

1012
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,296
Tracy.

1013
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:27,766
Tracy, come on!

1014
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,133
Tracy!

1015
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:32,170
Everybody out here!
It's fire drill!

1016
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,440
Fire drill time!

1017
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:36,941
Let's make it quiet.

1018
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:38,109
Let's make it quick.

1019
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:39,578
All right?

1020
00:51:41,614 --> 00:51:42,547
Go!

1021
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:00,098
Code blue.

1022
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:01,533
Come on.

1023
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,605
17 minutes
and 11 seconds

1024
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:08,874
For a fire drill?

1025
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,475
I am disappointed.

1026
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,544
Boy: Move over.

1027
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:13,612
Have you seen palmer
anywhere?

1028
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:14,613
Uh-uh.

1029
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:19,050
Blimp:
Oh, god. Rand.

1030
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,695
Tracy:
Hello?

1031
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:31,696
Eddie:
Hi, tracy.

1032
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,097
shit.

1033
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:38,537
I don't have anything
to say to you, ok?

1034
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,643
Tracy. Palmer.

1035
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,578
Tracy.
Tracy, come here.

1036
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:49,113
If people have
enough money,

1037
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,583
They ought to be taught
how to spend it properly.

1038
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:55,386
Tracy, would you kindly
inform palmer woodrow

1039
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:57,422
That you understood
his admiration

1040
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,891
After the first
6 dozen roses?

1041
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,794
Anything more
is wretched excess.

1042
00:53:16,308 --> 00:53:17,676
Tracy:
Oh, palmer.

1043
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:24,015
When you told me
how much you loved riding,

1044
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,083
I couldn't remember
whether you said

1045
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,785
You preferred
a hunter-jumper,

1046
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:27,886
A tennessee walker,

1047
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,988
Or just a good
old-fashioned trail horse.

1048
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:31,389
It doesn't matter.

1049
00:53:31,457 --> 00:53:33,391
We're going to have time
to do everything.

1050
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:34,993
Regis.
Regis: Yes.

1051
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,428
Tracy: Mr. Woodrow here
is an expert rider.

1052
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:38,897
Regis: Why don't you
mm-hmm. Saddle up

1053
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,532
Chained lightning
for him, ok?

1054
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:42,734
You're going to love
this horse.

1055
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,035
He's great.

1056
00:53:44,103 --> 00:53:46,104
I'll meet you
outside, ok?

1057
00:53:49,308 --> 00:53:50,909
I'll saddle
the motherfucker,

1058
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,846
But I sure hope you got
life insurance.

1059
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:55,981
Um...

1060
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:57,549
Whoa, whoa,
lightning.

1061
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:58,550
It's me, regis.

1062
00:54:00,686 --> 00:54:02,721
I ain't going to play
with you now.

1063
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:04,222
You got anything
old and slow

1064
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:07,291
In maybe a white,
a light brown?

1065
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,529
You don't know a damn thing
about horses, do you?

1066
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:11,930
Well, that's not true.

1067
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,832
That, uh, thing-

1068
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,400
That big thing that
she was on out there,

1069
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:16,701
That's a horse, right?

1070
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:18,102
That ain't no horse.

1071
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,271
<i>This is a horse.</i>

1072
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,206
Heh heh heh heh!

1073
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:27,111
You know, acting crazy ain't
going to help you none.

1074
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:28,179
Yeah, but if
I break my leg,

1075
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:29,514
I'm not going
to have to ride him.

1076
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,082
Chained lightning's going
to break more than that.

1077
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:35,086
Tracy: I'm going to go
warm up buttercup.

1078
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,158
Easy.

1079
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:47,532
What are these for?

1080
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,067
You steer with them.

1081
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:50,334
But most important,

1082
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:52,336
Pull hard to stop-

1083
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:53,538
Real hard.

1084
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:54,839
How do you make it move?

1085
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:56,708
All you got to say

1086
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:58,610
Is g-o.

1087
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:03,882
Just say go?

1088
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,883
aah!

1089
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,505
This is how
you take a boot off.

1090
00:55:27,573 --> 00:55:29,007
Turn around.

1091
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,042
No, no.
Face the other way.

1092
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,511
Come on.
Trust me.

1093
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:36,247
Now you-you pull,

1094
00:55:36,315 --> 00:55:37,315
I'll push.
Ready?

1095
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:38,549
Yeah?
Ok. Yeah.

1096
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:40,218
Now, I don't want
to put your horse-

1097
00:55:40,285 --> 00:55:41,219
Put your horse down
or anything,

1098
00:55:41,286 --> 00:55:43,088
But it's got no heart.

1099
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:44,656
See, it just saw
that flock of cobras,

1100
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:46,725
And, I don't know,
it just jumped up,

1101
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:47,659
Reared,
and just threw me.

1102
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,495
Oops.

1103
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:52,497
Cobras, my ass.

1104
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,500
regis...

1105
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:57,435
Why did you bring
3 glasses?

1106
00:55:57,503 --> 00:56:00,872
<i>Well, I thought
he might want some.</i>

1107
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:04,408
Regis...

1108
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:05,744
Haven't you got
something to do?

1109
00:56:05,811 --> 00:56:07,211
I'm doing it.

1110
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:11,616
Look...

1111
00:56:11,684 --> 00:56:13,718
You don't have
to pretend for me.

1112
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,453
What?

1113
00:56:15,521 --> 00:56:16,655
I know
all about you

1114
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,123
And your family.

1115
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:20,892
What-what do you mean?

1116
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,728
My father told me.

1117
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:26,031
The sense of tradition

1118
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:27,365
And social belonging

1119
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,134
And feeling comfortable
with your wealth-

1120
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:30,568
It all comes in time.

1121
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,270
You don't have
to feel embarrassed,

1122
00:56:32,337 --> 00:56:33,738
And you don't have
to try to impress me

1123
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:36,708
Just because you come
from new money.

1124
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:37,976
You see,

1125
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:40,712
What's important is that
you are what you are.

1126
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,913
You're genuine.

1127
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,447
That's what I like
about you.

1128
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:44,916
Yeah, me, too.

1129
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,450
Ha ha ha ha!

1130
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:48,319
Regis.

1131
00:56:48,387 --> 00:56:50,621
I'm going, I'm going.

1132
00:56:52,624 --> 00:56:56,394
Uh, holler
if you want any more.

1133
00:57:40,906 --> 00:57:43,541
¶ morning, afternoon,
and night ¶

1134
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:46,510
¶ we lay together
side by side ¶

1135
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:48,079
¶ searchin' for lust ¶

1136

¶ searchin' for breath ¶

1137
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:52,650
¶ searchin'
for the touch of life ¶

1138
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:55,319
¶ no words are spoken ¶

1139
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:58,022
¶ the only sound
we hear is ¶

1140
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,127
¶ body talk ¶

1141
00:58:04,363 --> 00:58:06,364
¶ the heat of passion ¶

1142
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:08,767
¶ is such
a beautiful thing ¶

1143
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,935
¶ as it overflows ¶

1144
00:58:11,003 --> 00:58:12,370
¶ pleasure grows ¶

1145
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:14,338
¶ all the dreams
it can bring ¶

1146
00:58:14,406 --> 00:58:18,143
¶ mmm,
you're using your eyes ¶

1147
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,178
¶ and gentle sighs ¶

1148
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,180
¶ with body talk ¶

1149
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:25,316
¶ body talk ¶

1150
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,655
¶ clean and calm,
so soft and pure ¶

1151
00:58:30,722 --> 00:58:33,158
¶ a touching moment ¶

1152
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:36,761
¶ inner feelings,
once explored ¶

1153
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:38,963
¶ but have noted ¶

1154
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:42,066
¶ we were 2 souls
torn apart ¶

1155
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:44,102
¶ with bitter pages ¶

1156
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,205

¶ body talk ¶

1160
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:01,652
Men...

1161
00:59:03,488 --> 00:59:05,290
For the past 5 years,

1162
00:59:05,357 --> 00:59:07,158
Hoover academy

1163
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:11,196
Has averaged the lowest
s. A.T. Scores

1164
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:13,564
In the english-speaking
world.

1165
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:14,565
Student:
Yay, hoover.

1166
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,434
Well, that ends today.

1167
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:17,568
I'm going to give
you guys

1168
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:20,504
A few cardinal rules
to follow.

1169
00:59:28,848 --> 00:59:30,181
First of all...

1170
00:59:31,683 --> 00:59:33,918
It is almost never
the letter "e. "

1171
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:37,989
Good luck.

1172
00:59:46,398 --> 00:59:47,631
Boy:
Yeah, wait up.

1173
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:51,202
¶ flex it ¶

1174
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:56,307
¶ flex it tonight ¶

1175
00:59:59,544 --> 01:00:01,012
Dice man.

1176
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,813
Woman: Hi, eddie.

1177
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:04,815
Nicky, what are you
doing here?

1178
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:09,354
Eddie, what?

1179
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:12,390
No christmas card?

1180
01:00:12,457 --> 01:00:13,992
No valentine candy?

1181
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:16,361
I'm a very delicate
human being.

1182
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:17,828
Yeah, I was gonna...

1183
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:18,997
I was gonna
call you, you know?

1184
01:00:19,064 --> 01:00:20,698
You've caused me
a great deal of hurt,

1185
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:22,267
Not to mention

1186
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:25,303
Causing nicky
a great deal of pain.

1187
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,905
Yeah, well, I was going
to come and see you.

1188
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:27,906
I mean, there was-

1189
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:29,607
I don't doubt it.
I don't doubt it.

1190
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:31,142
Shut your mouth
when I talk to you.

1191
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,111
Get over here.

1192
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:34,979
We've got a problem.

1193
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:36,714
You see, you owe me

1194
01:00:36,782 --> 01:00:40,318
$10,625.

1195
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,786
3,700.

1196
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:43,288
Interest.

1197
01:00:43,355 --> 01:00:45,089
Are you prepared
at this point in time

1198
01:00:45,157 --> 01:00:46,958
To make
full restitution?

1199
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:48,692
When you say "at this point
in time," do you mean now?

1200
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,727
Yeah.

1201
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:50,728
No.

1202
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:53,231
Eddie, not good.
Wrong answer.

1203
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:57,068
You know, you look
like a fish when I do-

1204
01:00:57,136 --> 01:00:58,970
Look at him.
Look, like a gup-

1205
01:00:59,038 --> 01:01:01,372
Hey, you punks
can be hamburger meat

1206
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,407
In 60 seconds.

1207
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:05,410
Cop a walk.

1208
01:01:05,477 --> 01:01:07,946
The beauty of it is,
they think I'm kidding.

1209
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:10,681
Heh heh heh! I crack
myself up, you know that?

1210
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:12,450
Listen, eddie, eddie,

1211
01:01:12,517 --> 01:01:15,386
I understand you're being
paid a considerable sum

1212
01:01:15,454 --> 01:01:17,322
To attend
hoover academy.

1213
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:20,992
No. I get the money
when I graduate.

1214
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,961
The interest alone
will bury you,

1215
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:25,629
But I'll tell you what-

1216
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:27,898
You're enterprising.

1217
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:29,600
Find a way.

1218
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:31,169
You got 72 hours.

1219
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:33,771
Eddie: Ok, 9.

1220
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,939
9's the point.

1221
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:36,474
The point is 9.

1222
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,942
Earn while
you learn, boys.

1223
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:38,943
Earn while you learn.

1224
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:40,011
Give it a little touch
here. Yeah.

1225
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,912
Boy: Lights out.
Lights out.

1226
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,348
All: Aw...

1227
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:47,018
Boy: 7.

1228
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:48,786
That's a loser.

1229
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:50,821
I thought 7
was a winner.

1230
01:01:50,889 --> 01:01:52,890
Only on
the come out one.

1231
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,394
Ok? Only on
the come out one.

1232
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,963
But a 7
is very close.

1233
01:01:59,031 --> 01:01:59,964
It's very close.

1234
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:02,400
You're getting
the hang of this game.

1235
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,635
Come on, sidney,
give it a try.

1236
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:06,070
Try it.

1237
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:11,142
Come on, sidney,
let's go.

1238
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,077
Come on.
You can do it.

1239
01:02:13,145 --> 01:02:15,713
I'm here to help you.

1240
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,981
You baby.

1241
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:18,682
Eddie:
Coach?

1242
01:02:19,985 --> 01:02:21,719
I want to settle
yesterday's bets.

1243
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,454
You played the lakers.
The lakers are losing.

1244
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:24,755
Come on, sidney,
let's go.

1245
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:26,290
Let's give it a try here.

1246
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:28,126
Come on. I'm right here.
I'm going to help you over.

1247
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:29,127
All right, woodrow,
what do I owe you?

1248
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:30,461
110 bucks.

1249
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:32,263
110 bucks?
Aah!

1250
01:02:37,636 --> 01:02:40,338
Somebody want to get
the first aid kit?

1251
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:41,772
And a mop.

1252
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,875
Let me say once again

1253
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:47,512
That whatever grant
your foundation designates

1254
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:48,879
For the hoover academy,

1255
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:50,948
It'll be greatly
appreciated

1256
01:02:51,016 --> 01:02:53,184
And immediately reflected
in improvements

1257
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:54,952
That will impact
student life.

1258
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,921
We want to thank you
again for coming.

1259
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:59,223
It's just a pleasure
to have you on the campus.

1260
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,758
Take a look
at our facility.

1261
01:03:00,825 --> 01:03:02,826
And by the way,
let me remind you

1262
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:04,628
About the reception
tonight.

1263
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:06,330
Be sure to attend.
It'll give you a chance

1264
01:03:06,398 --> 01:03:08,566
To meet some of
the other faculty members,

1265
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:12,503
As well as some of our
representative students.

1266
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:14,805
Yeah.

1267
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,108
Rand: Well, maybe
this dice man character

1268
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:18,109
Will take a check.

1269
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:21,845
Oh, oh, muffy
called you earlier.

1270
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,381
You mean palmer or bif?

1271
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:25,683
Palmer. She's pissed because
you've been avoiding her.

1272
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,784
Said she'd be here
this weekend

1273
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,253
For a confrontation.
Heh heh.

1274
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:30,421
What's the difference?

1275
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:33,291
I'm going to be dead
by this weekend anyway.

1276
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:34,625
Palmer:
¶ la la la la la ¶

1277
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:36,160
¶ la la la la la ¶

1278
01:03:36,228 --> 01:03:37,495
Hey!

1279
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,963
<i>Bonjour, boys.</i>

1280
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:43,401
Palmer,
what-what are you...

1281
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:45,403
What the hell
are you doing here? Yeah.

1282
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:47,037
I'm checking up
on my investment.

1283
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:48,306
Do you mind?

1284
01:03:48,373 --> 01:03:50,975
Hey, who is
reading this?

1285
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:52,143
I mean, give me
a break, will ya?

1286
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:55,146
Emily post does not know
dick about etiquette.

1287
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:56,481
I've been through
this whole book,

1288
01:03:56,548 --> 01:03:59,883
And there's not
one chapter on farting.

1289
01:03:59,951 --> 01:04:01,652
Hey! Hey!

1290
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,921
Man, this is
pinpoint oxford.

1291
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:06,457
Well, aren't you
mr. Hoity-toity?

1292
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:07,458
I thought you were
in europe

1293
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:08,459
Or in a turkish prison
or something.

1294
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,828
Paris ain't all
it's cracked up to be

1295
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:12,730
<i>In the springtime,
mon frere.</i>

1296
01:04:12,797 --> 01:04:13,831
Besides,
it's amazing

1297
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:15,333
How suspicious
your parents can get

1298
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,900
When you're using
their credit cards, you know?

1299
01:04:16,968 --> 01:04:18,169
Mm-hmm.

1300
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:19,837
Hey, rand, will you get
your skinny ass

1301
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:21,572
Off my fries, please?

1302
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,940
Aw, look at that.

1303
01:04:23,008 --> 01:04:23,941
God.

1304
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:24,942
Palmer...

1305
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,477
You know,

1306
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:27,645
You being here,

1307
01:04:27,712 --> 01:04:28,979
You may be able to solve
a few problems.

1308
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:29,980
Yeah? Like what?

1309
01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:31,649
Like muffy, who has
been looking for you

1310
01:04:31,716 --> 01:04:33,184
All year long.

1311
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:35,085
And what else?

1312
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:39,957
Who's this guy,
the auto shop teacher?

1313
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:41,759
Ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1314
01:04:41,826 --> 01:04:43,394
Hey, the 72 hours
isn't up yet.

1315
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,630
Auto shop teacher?

1316
01:04:47,499 --> 01:04:49,567
Heh.
How amusing.

1317
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,569
Heh heh heh.
Get over here.

1318
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,171
Rand: Wait,
you can't-aah!

1319
01:04:53,238 --> 01:04:55,039
What's this,
gumby goes to school?

1320
01:04:55,106 --> 01:04:56,507
Get over here.

1321
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,508
If you don't
kill me,

1322
01:04:57,576 --> 01:04:58,676
I'll buy you
a new gold chain.

1323
01:04:58,743 --> 01:05:00,611
Save your money
for a pine box.

1324
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:01,646
Get in here.

1325
01:05:04,115 --> 01:05:06,050
Eddie.

1326
01:05:06,117 --> 01:05:09,654
I don't have the money
that you want,

1327
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:12,623
So you're wasting your time
and your very fine wardrobe.

1328
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:15,560
You know, eddie,

1329
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:18,362
It greatly disturbs me
that being in my presence

1330
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,264
Makes you want to shit
in your pants.

1331
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:23,067
This is a celebration.

1332
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:25,936
I have made
a momontous decision.

1333
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:27,572
After consultating
with nicky,

1334
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:30,107
I find the only way
I have to collect my money

1335
01:05:30,175 --> 01:05:32,109
Is if you graduate,
am I correct?

1336
01:05:32,177 --> 01:05:33,578
Yes.

1337
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:34,645
Fine.

1338
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,714
Now, because I love you
like a brother-

1339
01:05:36,781 --> 01:05:37,781
And I mean that, eddie.

1340
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:39,250
It comes from the heart.
I mean it-

1341
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:41,719
The left aorta,
the vein that pumps love.

1342
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:42,853
I'm gonna cut you a deal.

1343
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:47,124
You're to collect $10,000
when you graduate.

1344
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:48,826
Keep 50 bucks
for yourself,

1345
01:05:48,893 --> 01:05:50,160
And I get the rest.

1346
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:52,530
50 bucks?

1347
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:54,699
Now, you're not
being released

1348
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,667
Totally on your own
recognizance.

1349
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,836
I mean, you've been known
to screw up in the past.

1350
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:00,871
For this very reason,

1351
01:06:00,939 --> 01:06:04,074
Nicky and myself
will remain

1352
01:06:04,142 --> 01:06:06,143
To make sure
you do not so choose

1353
01:06:06,211 --> 01:06:07,211
To do so again.

1354
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:08,846
Um, I-I don't think

1355
01:06:08,913 --> 01:06:10,848
That this is
a very good decision.

1356
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:12,883
I, however,

1357
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,719
Think it's
a brilliant idea-

1358
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:16,487
Brilliant.

1359
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,890
Is there now
a full understanding

1360
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,526
Between all parties
concerned, eddie?

1361
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:25,329
Uh, if that means
you and me,

1362
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:26,330
Yes.

1363
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:28,031
Good.

1364
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:29,634
Let us now commence...

1365
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:31,669
celebrating.

1366
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,150
Dice: Yo, we ran out
of chicks.

1367
01:06:46,217 --> 01:06:47,585
Hey, dice, dice.

1368
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:50,254
You know,
if I get kicked out,

1369
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,189
You're not going to get
any of your money.

1370
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:53,791
What, you can't have
a little fun?

1371
01:06:53,858 --> 01:06:55,058
I'm going to entertain
your friends.

1372
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:57,728
What are you
worried about? Here.

1373
01:06:57,796 --> 01:06:59,830
Don't worry about it.

1374
01:06:59,898 --> 01:07:01,666
Everybody out, ok?

1375
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:03,701
Just-just-
just go, ok?

1376
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,403
All: Ooh.

1377
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:15,613
Rand: Help! Ah ha!

1378
01:07:15,681 --> 01:07:17,348
Ah ha! Ah ha!

1379
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,783
Palmer, help!

1380
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,418
¶ this is the end ¶

1381
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:21,985
Mommy!

1382
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:27,024
¶ you make your choice,
and now the chance is over ¶

1383
01:07:27,091 --> 01:07:28,225
¶ I thought I was in ¶

1384
01:07:30,362 --> 01:07:34,298
¶ you put me down
and see I'm goin' nowhere ¶

1385
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:38,536
would you lay off the skull?

1386
01:07:38,603 --> 01:07:40,471
I-I-I work a long time
on my head,

1387
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:42,340
And you rattle
my brains.

1388
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:46,910
It-I get confused,
you know what I mean?

1389
01:07:46,978 --> 01:07:48,379
It's good stuff.
Ha ha.

1390
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:00,224
This must be
the building.

1391
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,492
Hear the music?

1392
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,394
It must be upstairs.

1393
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:05,863
My, it's awfully loud,
isn't it?

1394
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,833
Well, mr. Harriman said
there'll be some students here.

1395
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,235
I guess that's why.

1396
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:13,637
You know, I have
very good feelings

1397
01:08:13,705 --> 01:08:15,072
About this school.

1398
01:08:16,341 --> 01:08:18,576
And I'm usually right
about these things.

1399
01:08:18,643 --> 01:08:20,845
<i>You should be paying me
to go here, man.</i>

1400
01:08:20,912 --> 01:08:23,146
You're a jerk.
This is a school.

1401
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:26,183
I know. Is this some fabulous
educational system?

1402
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:27,117
Huh? Huh?

1403
01:08:34,092 --> 01:08:36,159
Party's over!

1404
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:37,160
Boy: Fire!

1405
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:40,564
Good god, this
could be flammable!

1406
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:41,699
There's a fire!

1407
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,434
Pbbt.

1408
01:08:45,504 --> 01:08:46,504
Oh!

1409
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:48,773
You two stay here.

1410
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:51,809
This could be dangerous.

1411
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,984
You disappoint me,
woodrow.

1412
01:09:01,052 --> 01:09:03,621
You really
disappoint me.

1413
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:05,188
Your academic
achievement

1414
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:06,590
Showed such promise,

1415
01:09:06,658 --> 01:09:08,526
And now this.

1416
01:09:08,593 --> 01:09:10,694
You cost this school
a much needed grant

1417
01:09:10,762 --> 01:09:13,297
Because you're cavorting
all over the hoover campus

1418
01:09:13,364 --> 01:09:15,699
With some-who knows
what kind of trash.

1419
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:17,468
I don't understand you.

1420
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,437
I mean, you come
from a good f-

1421
01:09:19,504 --> 01:09:20,971
<i>Well, a rich family.</i>

1422
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:22,973
Level with me, woodrow,
will you?

1423
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,608
You're not some kind of
a mental case, are you?

1424
01:09:24,676 --> 01:09:25,709
Because I don't
need that right now.

1425
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:26,644
I really don't.

1426
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,980
Starting today,
you are on probation.

1427
01:09:30,048 --> 01:09:31,982
And if you want to
continue your education

1428
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,216
At the hoover academy,

1429
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:35,820
I suggest you get your
father here immediately.

1430
01:09:35,887 --> 01:09:37,755
Um...

1431
01:09:37,823 --> 01:09:40,658
Well, my father, he's-
he's in europe on business.

1432
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:42,259
That's your problem.

1433
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:43,494
Get him here.

1434
01:09:43,562 --> 01:09:45,796
Well, forget it, man. You'll
never get my father here.

1435
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:47,598
You're talking about
blowing the whole thing.

1436
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:51,368
I never quite got the hang
of this game, did you?

1437
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:53,236
Look, look...

1438
01:09:53,304 --> 01:09:54,472
If I don't produce
a father,

1439
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:56,574
The whole thing's
gonna blow lunch.

1440
01:09:59,845 --> 01:10:01,479
Don't get testy
with me.

1441
01:10:01,546 --> 01:10:03,647
I'm doing my share.
I'm taking care of muffy,

1442
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,148
And I'm supplying
the capital.

1443
01:10:05,216 --> 01:10:06,517
Well, make sure you do
take care of muffy.

1444
01:10:06,585 --> 01:10:08,385
I mean, she could blow
this whole thing for us.

1445
01:10:08,453 --> 01:10:11,254
Look, will you guys
not sweat it, please?

1446
01:10:11,322 --> 01:10:12,957
Tact is my middle name.

1447
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:22,900
How could I let us
drift apart like that?

1448
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:26,436
How could I forget
how much I want you?

1449
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,238
I must have you...

1450
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:30,140
Now!

1451
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,275
Eee! Aah!

1452
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:39,750
That was fabulous.

1453
01:10:41,352 --> 01:10:44,688
Oh, jeez, I got a red sox
game I got to see.

1454
01:10:44,756 --> 01:10:46,023
Look, it was great
for me.

1455
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,625
I hope it was
fabulous for you.

1456
01:10:47,692 --> 01:10:48,559
Ahh.

1457
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:52,396
Alphonse. Alphonse.

1458
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:53,964
Alphonse. Hey, hey,
I'm through, ok?

1459
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,599
Knock it off, will you?
Here's for your trouble.

1460
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:58,402
Better be getting back
to the restaurant.

1461
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:01,005
Oh, by the way, I never
want to see you again.

1462
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:06,944
Send in mr. Woodrow
and his father.

1463
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,691
Mr. Woodrow.

1464
01:11:20,759 --> 01:11:21,692
Well, I wish
we were meeting

1465
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,960
Under different
circumstances.

1466
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,728
I appreciate
your coming.

1467
01:11:24,796 --> 01:11:27,364
Well, one must
always make time

1468
01:11:27,432 --> 01:11:28,832
For one's children.

1469
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:32,036
Right. Yeah.

1470
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:33,470
Of course.
Ahem.

1471
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:40,811
Oh. Thank you.
Uh...

1472
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,614
Now, I'm sure
that you can appreciate

1473
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:46,283
That education
is my life.

1474
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:48,986
I mean, my love.

1475
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,521
Now, I'm convinced
that there's no such thing

1476
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,057
As a bad boy.

1477
01:11:53,124 --> 01:11:55,726
Believe me, those convictions
have been tested

1478
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:57,427
By your son.

1479
01:11:57,495 --> 01:12:00,698
I know palmer
is not perfect.

1480
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:04,401
<i>He's no chateau
lafitte-rothschild '56,</i>

1481
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:08,739
<i>But he ain't-he isn't
beaujolais '76, either,</i>

1482
01:12:08,807 --> 01:12:11,274
Which, as we all know,

1483
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:14,812
Showed great promise,
but failed to develop.

1484
01:12:14,879 --> 01:12:17,748
<i>Palmer will develop-</i>

1485
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,249
Robustly.

1486
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:21,719
That's an interesting
analogy.

1487
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:22,953
It's not one that
I would've thought of,

1488
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:25,789
But probably
quite accurate.

1489
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:31,128
But don't think that
I fail to appreciate

1490
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:32,963
What you're doing-

1491
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,699
The service
that hoover prep

1492
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:38,201
Renders these boys.

1493
01:12:38,269 --> 01:12:39,937
In fact,

1494
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:41,571
I was contemplating

1495
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,174
Some way of expressing
my appreciation.

1496
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:47,778
Uh, perhaps...

1497
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:49,747
You could help me.

1498
01:12:49,814 --> 01:12:52,249
Yes.

1499
01:12:52,316 --> 01:12:54,018
Yeah. As a matter
of fact,

1500
01:12:54,085 --> 01:12:55,953
Absolutely.

1501
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:57,655
Well, you know,
the old library

1502
01:12:57,722 --> 01:13:00,190
Has served us well
for years, but now...

1503
01:13:00,258 --> 01:13:02,126
I've always wondered
what that building was.

1504
01:13:02,193 --> 01:13:05,095
Well, tradition
has its place,

1505
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:07,564
But a better library

1506
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:10,000
Means
better students.

1507
01:13:11,269 --> 01:13:14,638
The woodrow
memorial library.

1508
01:13:14,706 --> 01:13:19,076
Uh, dad, don't you have
a plane to catch?

1509
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:24,148
Back to mars.

1510
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:27,584
Functional, I suppose,

1511
01:13:27,652 --> 01:13:30,253
But hardly contemporary.

1512
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:33,423
The james beard
gymnasium.

1513
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:35,458
You don't mind
if I call it

1514
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:39,329
After one
of my personal heroes?

1515
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:41,965
The dormitories-
I must see those.

1516
01:13:42,033 --> 01:13:44,601
A pleasant ambiance
is essential.

1517
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:49,606
Well, mr. Woodrow,

1518
01:13:49,674 --> 01:13:51,474
I feel much better
about palmer-

1519
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:52,475
Much better.

1520
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:53,744
In fact,
I see no reason why

1521
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:55,012
He should remain
on probation.

1522
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,414
Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk.
No favoritism.

1523
01:13:57,481 --> 01:14:00,050
If palmer
is on probation,

1524
01:14:00,118 --> 01:14:02,419
Then he must earn
his way off.

1525
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:03,420
What?

1526
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:05,856
That's a refreshing
sentiment.

1527
01:14:05,924 --> 01:14:07,257
Oh...

1528
01:14:07,325 --> 01:14:08,391
Thank you.

1529
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:12,295
No. There mustn't be
any preferential treatment.

1530
01:14:12,363 --> 01:14:15,199
That doesn't build
character in a man.

1531
01:14:15,266 --> 01:14:18,702
Isn't that what hoover
is all about?

1532
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:20,604
I can't believe
you said that, nicky.

1533
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:22,906
How could you say
something like that?

1534
01:14:22,974 --> 01:14:24,307
I thought
I did well.

1535
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:25,375
Well, nicky?

1536
01:14:25,443 --> 01:14:26,643
You went psycho on me.

1537
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,046
The woodrow
memorial library?

1538
01:14:29,114 --> 01:14:30,114
He's probably going
to hold up my diploma

1539
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:32,049
Until the new dorm's
built.

1540
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:34,184
Let him earn his way
off probation?

1541
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:35,185
Thanks, nick.

1542
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:37,020
I was merely echoing
my father's belief

1543
01:14:37,088 --> 01:14:39,156
That you spare the rod
and spoil the child.

1544
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,423
Yeah, well, it's too bad
he didn't believe

1545
01:14:40,491 --> 01:14:41,658
In birth control.

1546
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:43,593
Listen, when you went
in there,

1547
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:45,195
They was ready
to kick you out.

1548
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:48,132
Now they're ready
to kiss your ass.

1549
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:49,933
So, you graduate.

1550
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:52,770
Then I take away
my donation money, ok?

1551
01:14:52,837 --> 01:14:55,372
So now you're a hero.

1552
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:57,040
Hey? Huh?

1553
01:14:57,108 --> 01:14:59,509
Among the modern
society dances,

1554
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:01,611
The waltz
is the most important.

1555
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,113
The origins
of many of the dances

1556
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:05,015
Are rather obscure.

1557
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,850
¶ I'm back ¶

1558
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:08,685
And I'm better
than ever, baby.

1559
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:09,686
Took care of muffy,

1560
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:11,922
Gave her the old
hot beef injection,

1561
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,324
And left her
begging for more.

1562
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:15,993
Hey, who's this,
friar tuck?

1563
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,094
Nice build, kid.

1564
01:15:17,162 --> 01:15:20,230
Uh, blimp, I'd like you
to meet eddie,

1565
01:15:20,298 --> 01:15:21,799
Palmer's
retarded cousin.

1566
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,466
Palmer? Palmer?

1567
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:25,435
Where is the old sot?

1568
01:15:25,503 --> 01:15:26,469
Sot?

1569
01:15:26,537 --> 01:15:28,505
He's eating dinner
with his father.

1570
01:15:28,572 --> 01:15:30,473
And how is
old daddykins?

1571
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:32,475
I guess
daddykins is fine,

1572
01:15:32,543 --> 01:15:35,512
Because palmer hasn't
been back to pack.

1573
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:36,980
No?
Well, then,

1574
01:15:37,048 --> 01:15:38,615
Let's celebrate.

1575
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:42,619
For you, little john,
a muttonchop

1576
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:43,753
And a gift of bacchus

1577
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:45,655
With which
to wash it down.

1578
01:15:45,723 --> 01:15:46,857
It's all right.
He's schizo.

1579
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,758
Thinks he's errol flynn
once in a while.

1580
01:15:48,827 --> 01:15:50,894
Come, you must join
my merry band,

1581
01:15:50,962 --> 01:15:52,762
And then you, too,
may laugh like this-

1582
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:54,497
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1583
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:56,466
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha!

1584
01:15:56,534 --> 01:15:59,303
A manly laugh for
manly men such as we.

1585
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:04,541
Aah!

1586
01:16:04,608 --> 01:16:06,176
Mr. Hoover.
Hi.

1587
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:07,410
Can I help you
with something?

1588
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:08,946
I was looking
for young woodrow.

1589
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:11,581
I have a little something here
for him and his father.

1590
01:16:11,649 --> 01:16:14,318
He's out, but his cousin
the retard's here.

1591
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:16,653
<i>Weren't you the host
on creature features?</i>

1592
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:18,755
I'm sorry I missed him.

1593
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:20,157
There's so much
to talk about

1594
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:23,426
Since his exciting meeting
with headmaster harriman.

1595
01:16:23,494 --> 01:16:24,594
Would you see
that he gets this?

1596
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:25,662
Oh, sure.

1597
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,797
With my regards.

1598
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:29,632
Hey, boris, suck a few
necks for me tonight,

1599
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,968
Huh, buddy?

1600
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,912
After you.

1601
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,413
Ooh!
Ha ha ha!

1602
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:44,681
Big comedy.

1603
01:16:44,749 --> 01:16:45,615
Hey.

1604
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,454
Jeez, don't you think you're
taking this fitting-in bit

1605
01:16:51,522 --> 01:16:52,522
A little too far?

1606
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:53,857
I know you won't
take this personally,

1607
01:16:53,925 --> 01:16:55,658
But you look like
a real asshole

1608
01:16:55,726 --> 01:16:56,793
In that outfit.

1609
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,029
Sounds to me like you guys
are a little jealous.

1610
01:16:59,097 --> 01:17:02,499
Maybe I'm better at this
than you are.

1611
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:03,767
Oh, yeah? Well, at least
I took care of muffy

1612
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:06,336
Without promising to build
her a fucking library.

1613
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:08,238
Are you going
to be here long?

1614
01:17:08,306 --> 01:17:09,506
Because I think
you're going to make things

1615
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:10,507
Very untidy.

1616
01:17:10,574 --> 01:17:11,508
What are you
talking about?

1617
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:13,210
We're at
the finish line, man.

1618
01:17:13,278 --> 01:17:15,279
Besides, I'm lovable,
I'm affable,

1619
01:17:15,346 --> 01:17:19,983
And I pay for
half of this room.

1620
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:21,018
Where are you going?

1621
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:23,120
I thought we were going
to go to a movie.

1622
01:17:23,187 --> 01:17:25,355
Do I look like I'm dressed
for the movies?

1623
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:26,390
Yeah, but you said-

1624
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:27,857
Randall...

1625
01:17:27,926 --> 01:17:30,127
Please, don't whine

1626
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:32,595
And don't
cramp my style.

1627
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:40,370
Hey, he's getting real
good at this, you know?

1628
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:42,872
I mean, he's turning
into a real scumbag.

1629
01:17:42,941 --> 01:17:45,342
The fox certainly is
an elusive animal.

1630
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,376
Palmer!

1631
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:47,811
Hey, palmer!

1632
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:48,812
Hey, chump!

1633
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:51,214
Good ride, palmer.

1634
01:17:51,282 --> 01:17:52,515
You know, I shouldn't be
at all surprised

1635
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:53,984
If we're looking
at this year's winner

1636
01:17:54,052 --> 01:17:56,486
Of the hoover award.

1637
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:58,688
Right. See you up
at the house for cocktails.

1638
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:00,057
All right?
Yes, sir.

1639
01:18:00,124 --> 01:18:01,591
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmm.

1640
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:04,494
What do you want?

1641
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:05,495
Now, that ain't
no way to talk

1642
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:07,497
To your old buddy
regis.

1643
01:18:07,565 --> 01:18:08,898
I have
to mingle,

1644
01:18:08,967 --> 01:18:11,501
Be social.

1645
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:13,003
How would you like it
if I bring chained lightning

1646
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:14,771
By to mangle you?

1647
01:18:14,839 --> 01:18:16,773
Hey, look, what is
your problem here?

1648
01:18:16,841 --> 01:18:17,975
I mean,

1649
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:20,577
You're not really starting
to get into this, are you?

1650
01:18:20,644 --> 01:18:22,079
Is that wrong?

1651
01:18:22,146 --> 01:18:23,513
It's how you live.

1652
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:25,449
No, no. You're
missing the point.

1653
01:18:25,516 --> 01:18:26,783
Hello, ladies.

1654
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:28,185
that's how
my family has lived

1655
01:18:28,252 --> 01:18:29,186
For a very long time.

1656
01:18:29,253 --> 01:18:31,788
This is not
how I think.

1657
01:18:31,856 --> 01:18:34,557
Oh, you think
I've changed.

1658
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:38,161
Well, I haven't. I'm still
the same lovable guy.

1659
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:39,596
Yeah.

1660
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:41,298
Well, I don't think
the same lovable guy

1661
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:45,235
Would let daddy buy him
the hoover award.

1662
01:18:46,704 --> 01:18:49,206
What does that crack mean?

1663
01:18:49,273 --> 01:18:50,140
Aw, shit! Ohh!

1664
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,110
Good guess.

1665
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:00,083
Muffy: Bif!

1666
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:01,018
Bif.

1667
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:05,322
Uh...

1668
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:06,723
I forgot to tell you.

1669
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:09,792
Bif is my middle name.

1670
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,595
Bif is
your middle name.

1671
01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:13,930
Hey, muffy,
great to see you,

1672
01:19:13,998 --> 01:19:15,632
But, hey, sorry,
it's bad timing.

1673
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:16,666
We're really on the run
here with finals.

1674
01:19:20,371 --> 01:19:21,304
Tracy.

1675
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:22,305
How you doing?

1676
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:23,806
Fine.
Is that for me?

1677
01:19:23,874 --> 01:19:24,974
No.

1678
01:19:25,043 --> 01:19:26,443
It's a peace offering
for palmer.

1679
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,245
Oh. Well, if you want
to catch him,

1680
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:29,379
You'd better hurry.

1681
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:33,450
He just ran off with
a muffy something or other.

1682
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:34,717
Eddie: If you really
want to be with me,

1683
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:35,885
Sneak into
the dorm tonight.

1684
01:19:35,953 --> 01:19:36,953
The dorm?
Why not?

1685
01:19:40,758 --> 01:19:42,892
Gosh, tracy, he sure
sees a lot of her, too.

1686
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,594
You know, I just don't know
how he can keep track

1687
01:19:44,662 --> 01:19:47,197
Of who he's dating.

1688
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:49,099
Yeah.
Look, here.

1689
01:19:50,435 --> 01:19:51,801
Heh heh.

1690
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:15,292
Ok, bif,

1691
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:16,326
You better be worth it.

1692
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:21,831
Where's bif hamilton?

1693
01:20:26,637 --> 01:20:28,138
Back off, buster.

1694
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:33,143
Mmm.

1695
01:20:40,985 --> 01:20:42,352
Bif?

1696
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:45,522
Bif.

1697
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:52,962
Sir...

1698
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:56,799
I think that you know
how much this hurts me-

1699
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:57,867
How much it hurts me

1700
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:01,605
To squeal on
a fellow student-

1701
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:04,241
But it's bif, sir.

1702
01:21:04,308 --> 01:21:07,110
He has a girl
in his room.

1703
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:16,353
Damn.

1704
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:19,856
We'll see
what palmer thinks of this.

1705
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:24,093
Bif: Skip?

1706
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:40,644
Where the hell is bugs?

1707
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:41,811
Well, you must've
done something.

1708
01:21:41,879 --> 01:21:43,547
I mean, tracy's
not just pissed at you

1709
01:21:43,614 --> 01:21:45,482
For the sake
of being pissed.

1710
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:48,251
Any of you gentlemen
seen palm-

1711
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:49,719
There you are.
Ha ha!

1712
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:52,222
You rascal. I've been
hunting all over for you.

1713
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:54,791
Uh, how do you think
your finals are going?

1714
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:56,793
Good, I hope, because
it'd be embarrassing

1715
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:57,794
If you didn't win

1716
01:21:57,861 --> 01:21:59,362
That hoover memorial
award this year.

1717
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,231
I mean, after your father
and his business manager

1718
01:22:01,299 --> 01:22:03,166
Set up that wonderful
fund for us.

1719
01:22:03,234 --> 01:22:04,834
All: What?

1720
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:06,503
He didn't tell you
about it, huh?

1721
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,104
Oh, it's really
quite simple.

1722
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:10,473
You see, for
every dollar raised

1723
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,242
And put into the fund
by the academy,

1724
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,843
He matches it
with a dollar.

1725
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,878
And, of course,
that...

1726
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:17,247
That wonderful business
manager of his-

1727
01:22:17,315 --> 01:22:19,082
What's his name?
Diceman?

1728
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:20,850
Uh, he's going
to administer

1729
01:22:20,918 --> 01:22:22,051
The fund for us.

1730
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:24,554
Oh, that's-
that's great.

1731
01:22:24,622 --> 01:22:26,189
yeah.

1732
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:27,190
You-

1733
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:28,592
Do I know you?

1734
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:30,059
Exchange student...

1735
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:32,329
From slobovia.

1736
01:22:32,396 --> 01:22:35,131
Oh, yeah, I think I remember
hearing about that.

1737
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,533
Well, I got to get down
to the gym.

1738
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:37,734
Wordman and I
are playing

1739
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:39,469
A little one-on-one
basketball.

1740
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,038
I'm quite good, really.

1741
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:43,139
I can't believe it.

1742
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:44,574
Look, we're going to
have to tell the school

1743
01:22:44,642 --> 01:22:46,343
Everything, all right?
Everything.

1744
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,311
No way.

1745
01:22:48,379 --> 01:22:49,446
The dice man's
going to say

1746
01:22:49,513 --> 01:22:51,348
That we're
part of the scam.

1747
01:22:51,415 --> 01:22:53,683
Phony student,
phony father-

1748
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:55,118
Real jail.

1749
01:22:55,185 --> 01:22:56,819
Don't look at me.
I did my part.

1750
01:22:56,887 --> 01:22:59,122
I took care of muffy.
Muffy took care of bif.

1751
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:01,124
I did my part.
Just give me my diploma.

1752
01:23:01,191 --> 01:23:03,126
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm through.

1753
01:23:03,193 --> 01:23:04,461
I'm finished, all right?

1754
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:08,298
You have been treating me
like dog shit, mr. Bmoc,

1755
01:23:08,366 --> 01:23:09,299
And you haven't been
very nice, either,

1756
01:23:09,367 --> 01:23:10,634
You know, palmer?

1757
01:23:10,701 --> 01:23:12,235
I'm rich. I don't
have to be nice.

1758
01:23:14,372 --> 01:23:16,706
Don't sound
so depressing.

1759
01:23:16,774 --> 01:23:17,807
Ok?

1760
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:20,343
It's depressing.

1761
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:27,517
Rand: Eddie?

1762
01:23:28,785 --> 01:23:29,719
What are you doing?

1763
01:23:29,786 --> 01:23:31,854
I can't sleep.

1764
01:23:31,922 --> 01:23:34,257
I'm gonna see tracy.

1765
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:35,492
Ohh.

1766
01:23:37,128 --> 01:23:38,261
Ohh!
What, what?

1767
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:40,163
Is there a party?
What? I'll go.

1768
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:42,132
Come on,
come on.

1769
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:43,399
Can I have a refill
on this, please?

1770
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:49,839
¶ takin' the brakes off ¶

1771
01:23:49,906 --> 01:23:51,774
¶ yeah ¶

1772
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:53,543
¶ takin' the brakes off ¶

1773
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,544
Rand: Hey, wait!

1774
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:57,147
Are you nuts?
Are you crazy?

1775
01:23:57,214 --> 01:23:58,414
You're stealing
bif's car!

1776
01:23:58,482 --> 01:23:59,882
So what?

1777
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,351
Palmer: Is this just
a harmless campus hijink?

1778
01:24:01,418 --> 01:24:03,153
I mean, I'm in
no personal danger, am I?

1779
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,787
Look, eddie, you could
be expelled for this.

1780
01:24:04,855 --> 01:24:06,523
I'm scared!
We're going to crash!

1781
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:08,258
We're going to die!
I'm scared!

1782
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:10,293
I don't want to die!
It hurts to die!

1783
01:24:10,361 --> 01:24:11,894
I'm scared!
We're going to crash!

1784
01:24:11,962 --> 01:24:13,863
Will you shut up?

1785
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:16,399
Oh, my god,
we're going to crash!

1786
01:24:17,668 --> 01:24:18,868
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1787
01:24:18,935 --> 01:24:20,336
There. There.

1788
01:24:20,404 --> 01:24:21,737
I arranged
a crash for you.

1789
01:24:21,805 --> 01:24:23,873
Ok? So there's nothing
more to be afraid of.

1790
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,376
My god, it was zero gs
there for a minute.

1791
01:24:26,443 --> 01:24:30,780
¶ lead all the rats
tomorrow ¶

1792
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:31,947
Rand: Oh, my god!

1793
01:24:32,015 --> 01:24:34,884
Now the hoovers are going
to kill us, too.

1794
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:36,719
¶ takin' the brakes off ¶

1795
01:24:36,787 --> 01:24:38,754
My parents-my parents
are going to kill me!

1796
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:40,823
My little sister,
she's going to kill me!

1797
01:24:40,891 --> 01:24:43,826
7 years of prep school
down the tubes.

1798
01:24:43,894 --> 01:24:44,960
God.
Oh, my god.

1799
01:24:45,028 --> 01:24:46,429
Oh, my god.

1800
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:47,664
Ngh!

1801
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,334
You're unstable,
aren't you?

1802
01:24:51,402 --> 01:24:52,335
Rand:
Let's get out of here.

1803
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:53,836
Please take me back.
You're crazy.

1804
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:55,672
I don't want to be here.
I don't like it here.

1805
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:57,540
Then leave.
I'm gonna see tracy.

1806
01:24:57,608 --> 01:24:58,541
It's 3:00
in the morning.

1807
01:24:58,609 --> 01:25:01,177
What is she,
a fucking vampire?

1808
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:02,245
You think
she'll talk to you

1809
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:03,779
Because you throw a rock
through her window?

1810
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:04,780
Well, she isn't
going to talk to me

1811
01:25:04,848 --> 01:25:06,182
After dice and nicky
swindle the school.

1812
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,451
You want to wake her up?
I'll wake her up.

1813
01:25:08,519 --> 01:25:10,253
Ngh!

1814
01:25:11,322 --> 01:25:12,922
No, no! Shh, shh!

1815
01:25:12,989 --> 01:25:14,624
Hey, honey,

1816
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:15,625
Yo!

1817
01:25:17,294 --> 01:25:18,494
What are you
doing?

1818
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:19,629
Aah!

1819
01:25:20,764 --> 01:25:23,933
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1820
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,702
I live here,
remember?

1821
01:25:25,769 --> 01:25:26,869
I couldn't sleep,
so I decided

1822
01:25:26,937 --> 01:25:28,804
To take a walk
around my house.

1823
01:25:28,872 --> 01:25:30,005
Well, that is
terrific,

1824
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:31,641
Because I couldn't
sleep, either.

1825
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,643
Listen, I've been
calling you all day.

1826
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:34,877
We have to talk.

1827
01:25:34,945 --> 01:25:36,078
No.

1828
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:37,447
If I would've wanted
to talk to you,

1829
01:25:37,514 --> 01:25:38,448
I would've.

1830
01:25:38,515 --> 01:25:39,582
Now, would you
please go away?

1831
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:41,351
No. Listen,
listen, listen.

1832
01:25:41,418 --> 01:25:42,818
I stole a car.

1833
01:25:42,886 --> 01:25:44,320
I-I skipped
off campus.

1834
01:25:44,388 --> 01:25:45,821
I drove across
your lawn.

1835
01:25:45,889 --> 01:25:47,290
I mean, that's
worth 5 minutes.

1836
01:25:47,358 --> 01:25:48,358
Palmer:
Excuse me.

1837
01:25:48,425 --> 01:25:49,392
Excuse me.

1838
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,660
You wouldn't mind
if I went in the house,

1839
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,962
Made myself a sandwich,
got a little coffee, would ya?

1840
01:25:54,298 --> 01:25:57,400
I didn't think
you would. Thank you.

1841
01:25:57,468 --> 01:25:58,834
Come on.

1842
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,810
Well, I guess I'll just
stay and watch the car.

1843
01:26:07,878 --> 01:26:12,448
Eddie: I'm just asking
you to hear me out.

1844
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:14,384
So you're going
to sit here,

1845
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:15,485
And you're going
to listen to me.

1846
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,288
There is nothing
you can say.

1847
01:26:18,355 --> 01:26:20,122
Look, I saw you with
muffy again the other day.

1848
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:21,758
Oh, come on,
that's muffy.

1849
01:26:21,825 --> 01:26:22,958
I can explain that.

1850
01:26:23,026 --> 01:26:25,328
No.
It's not that.

1851
01:26:25,396 --> 01:26:27,263
It's you.

1852
01:26:27,331 --> 01:26:29,332
What you are and
what I thought you were

1853
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,933
Are 2 completely
different things.

1854
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,838
I guess it's my fault.

1855
01:26:35,906 --> 01:26:36,972
I've been looking
for something

1856
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,508
That wasn't even there.

1857
01:26:38,575 --> 01:26:40,576
You think that
this has changed me,

1858
01:26:40,644 --> 01:26:42,011
Right?
Yes.

1859
01:26:42,078 --> 01:26:43,279
Well, you're wrong.

1860
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:46,416
I don't even know you
anymore.

1861
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:49,686
God, that makes me
so sad.

1862
01:26:49,753 --> 01:26:50,687
Tracy.

1863
01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:52,121
Tracy, don't go.

1864
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:08,671
Uhh.

1865
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,106
How'd it go?

1866
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:13,242
Ah.

1867
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:15,745
Uhh.

1868
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:17,613
Great blt.

1869
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:19,081
I think the mayonnaise
is a little funny.

1870
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:20,450
I hallucinated
I saw that guy

1871
01:27:20,517 --> 01:27:21,551
Who looked like
boris karloff

1872
01:27:21,618 --> 01:27:22,819
In there again.

1873
01:27:22,886 --> 01:27:24,420
Shit!

1874
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:25,722
Mmm.

1875
01:27:25,789 --> 01:27:27,323
Boy, I tell you,
that sexual tension

1876
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:28,324
Is murder, man.

1877
01:27:28,392 --> 01:27:30,693
It'll scar you
for life.

1878
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:35,297
What, are we
walking back?

1879
01:27:35,366 --> 01:27:37,099
We're walking back?

1880
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:39,535
Can't you steal
another car?

1881
01:27:41,938 --> 01:27:43,205
Bif: Mr. Harriman,
I swear to you,

1882
01:27:43,273 --> 01:27:44,507
I don't know
how it got there.

1883
01:27:44,575 --> 01:27:47,042
I parked it in the lot,

1884
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:48,077
I went up to my room,

1885
01:27:48,144 --> 01:27:49,912
And I studied diligently
all night.

1886
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:52,382
Don't make me puke,
hamilton.

1887
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:54,049
All I know is,
it's your car,

1888
01:27:54,117 --> 01:27:55,385
It was
the hoovers' yard,

1889
01:27:55,452 --> 01:27:56,786
And you're expelled.

1890
01:27:56,854 --> 01:27:58,220
But, sir, I-

1891
01:27:58,288 --> 01:27:59,389
You're expelled.

1892
01:27:59,456 --> 01:28:01,123
Get out of here.

1893
01:28:01,191 --> 01:28:02,425
<i>Moi?</i>

1894
01:28:02,493 --> 01:28:04,394
Expelled?

1895
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:06,061
Aw, but...

1896
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:17,139
Bif: I had plans.

1897
01:28:17,207 --> 01:28:20,309
I can't go
to summer school.

1898
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:23,646
I don't know anybody
who goes to summer school.

1899
01:28:23,714 --> 01:28:25,180
Woman: All right.

1900
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:33,155
take a hike, gumby.

1901
01:28:33,223 --> 01:28:34,690
Hey, nice dress.

1902
01:28:34,758 --> 01:28:36,826
If I knew they turned you
into a freak of nature,

1903
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:38,060
I would've made you
a dicette.

1904
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:39,328
Had I known about
your scam-

1905
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:41,997
You would've done exactly
what you're doing now-

1906
01:28:42,065 --> 01:28:43,165
Cooperating.

1907
01:28:43,233 --> 01:28:44,834
I didn't want anything
to do with this, eddie.

1908
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:48,270
But he did not want to
jeopardize our friendship.

1909
01:28:48,338 --> 01:28:49,672
Look...

1910
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,140
We'll all prosper.

1911
01:28:51,207 --> 01:28:52,875
What do you care about
these people, anyway?

1912
01:28:52,943 --> 01:28:54,176
If they knew
who you were,

1913
01:28:54,244 --> 01:28:55,311
You couldn't
kiss their ass.

1914
01:28:55,378 --> 01:28:57,146
He's right, eddie.
He's right.

1915
01:28:57,213 --> 01:28:59,415
I'm always right.

1916
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:00,817
I'm ingeniousal.

1917
01:29:04,287 --> 01:29:05,621
Whew.

1918
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:08,324
Kid's got
an attitude.

1919
01:29:08,391 --> 01:29:09,892
Yeah, he's got
an attitude.

1920
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,993
Shut up.

1921
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:14,697
Do you have
any drugs?

1922
01:29:25,642 --> 01:29:27,076
Mr. Hoover:
Mr. Woodrow.

1923
01:29:27,143 --> 01:29:28,377
Uh...

1924
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,448
Woman: Ha ha ha!

1925
01:29:32,516 --> 01:29:34,817
Mr. Woodrow. Mr. Woodrow,
I'm delighted to see you.

1926
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:36,486
Why don't you come this way
to the auditorium

1927
01:29:36,553 --> 01:29:37,687
Where we can talk?

1928
01:29:44,828 --> 01:29:48,130
Excuse me. Are you
the gentleman they call dice?

1929
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:49,899
No, I'm
the tooth fairy.

1930
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:51,266
Yeah, I'm dice.
Who are you?

1931
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:53,669
I drive for
the real mr. Woodrow.

1932
01:29:53,737 --> 01:29:54,971
Ahem.

1933
01:29:55,038 --> 01:29:57,239
Yeah? What's that
supposed to mean to me?

1934
01:29:57,307 --> 01:29:59,509
Mr. Woodrow can explain.

1935
01:29:59,576 --> 01:30:01,010
Unless you'd prefer
to have the authorities

1936
01:30:01,077 --> 01:30:02,344
Do the explaining.

1937
01:30:02,412 --> 01:30:03,312
That's all right.

1938
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:42,184
<i>When I have my diploma,
mon ami.</i>

1939
01:30:47,057 --> 01:30:49,491
Well, it's hard for me
to believe-

1940
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,928
Another school year
past,

1941
01:30:51,995 --> 01:30:54,363
Another hoover class
graduating...

1942
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:56,398
Pretty outrageous
disguise, eh, guys?

1943
01:30:56,466 --> 01:30:58,935
<i>Sort of rive gauche,
don't you think, huh?</i>

1944
01:30:59,002 --> 01:31:01,637
If muffy recognizes me,
I'm dead meat.

1945
01:31:01,705 --> 01:31:02,905
Harriman:
Preparation-

1946
01:31:02,973 --> 01:31:04,506
Preparation
to deal with

1947
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:06,208
Those less fortunate
than ourselves,

1948
01:31:06,276 --> 01:31:07,977
That great mass
of people.

1949
01:31:09,412 --> 01:31:11,313
your dirty little scam

1950
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:12,848
Ends today,

1951
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,784
And I will personally
take care of

1952
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:18,054
That wacko hot dog salesman
impersonating me

1953
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:21,156
And that punk
impersonating my son.

1954
01:31:21,224 --> 01:31:22,658
'cause as I see it,

1955
01:31:22,726 --> 01:31:25,027
You're the little fish
in this scam.

1956
01:31:25,095 --> 01:31:27,162
They're the brains.

1957
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,731
Oh, yes, sir.

1958
01:31:28,799 --> 01:31:29,765
As a matter of fact,

1959
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:31,567
They had me sucked
into this whole thing

1960
01:31:31,635 --> 01:31:33,603
Before I even knew
what was going on.

1961
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:36,639
I mean, I'm a song-
and-dance man by trade.

1962
01:31:36,707 --> 01:31:40,042
This tomfoolery
doesn't hold water with me.

1963
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,277
Randall weatherby.

1964
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,881
Palmer e. Woodrow.

1965
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:50,052
Hobart yarborough.

1966
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,154
And last but not least,

1967
01:31:52,222 --> 01:31:53,756
Edmund zucchini.

1968
01:31:53,824 --> 01:31:55,424
excuse me. Zuchini.

1969
01:31:55,492 --> 01:31:59,361
I speak for all of us here
when I say we're darn proud.

1970
01:31:59,429 --> 01:32:00,596
Ha ha. Darn proud.

1971
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:03,265
You've had
a hoover education,

1972
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,468
And a hoover education
is an expensive education,

1973
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:08,437
And that's worth something.

1974
01:32:08,505 --> 01:32:10,039
Now it gives us
great pleasure

1975
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:12,508
To introduce
mr. Thorndike hoover

1976
01:32:12,575 --> 01:32:16,679
To present this year's
annual hoover memorial award.

1977
01:32:16,747 --> 01:32:17,780
Thorndike.

1978
01:32:17,848 --> 01:32:19,348
Thank you.

1979
01:32:25,255 --> 01:32:28,624
Well, this certainly is
an exciting moment, isn't it?

1980
01:32:28,692 --> 01:32:30,860
I want to save my family

1981
01:32:30,927 --> 01:32:32,094
Further embarrassment.

1982
01:32:32,162 --> 01:32:34,396
To do that,
you disappear.

1983
01:32:34,464 --> 01:32:36,732
We understand
each other?

1984
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,167
Dice: Oh, yes, sir.

1985
01:32:38,234 --> 01:32:40,269
If you interfere,

1986
01:32:40,336 --> 01:32:42,404
Things could
become unpleasant.

1987
01:32:47,044 --> 01:32:48,811
Here's your ticket.

1988
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:52,081
You take your song-and-
dance act on the road.

1989
01:32:53,717 --> 01:32:55,384
You like al pacino?

1990
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:56,451
Watch this.

1991
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:00,489
I'm dyin' over here.

1992
01:33:00,557 --> 01:33:03,759
I can't take it.
Everybody's comin' down at me.

1993
01:33:05,395 --> 01:33:07,930
Oh,
he doesn't like pacino.

1994
01:33:10,266 --> 01:33:13,602
How was I to know
he didn't like pacino?

1995
01:33:15,438 --> 01:33:17,940
Have a nice flight,
jerk-off.

1996
01:33:18,008 --> 01:33:19,175
Ha ha ha.

1997
01:33:23,379 --> 01:33:26,615
But enough of
my world war ii experiences.

1998
01:33:26,683 --> 01:33:30,753
It-it's time for this most
important announcement.

1999
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:32,354
It gives me great pleasure

2000
01:33:32,422 --> 01:33:34,590
To announce
this year's recipient

2001
01:33:34,657 --> 01:33:37,026
Of the hoover
memorial award.

2002
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:39,528
Mr. Palmer woodrow.

2003
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:16,766
I'd like to, uh,
thank mr. Hoover

2004
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:19,635
And, uh,
the board of trustees

2005
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:21,103
And, uh...

2006
01:34:21,171 --> 01:34:25,474
Uh, the entire faculty here
at hoover academy.

2007
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:29,211
Uh, this award
means a lot to me.

2008
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,082
Um, more than I think
any of you can imagine,

2009
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:36,351
Because for the first time
in my life,

2010
01:34:36,419 --> 01:34:38,654
I did something
that a lot of people,

2011
01:34:38,721 --> 01:34:40,256
Including myself,

2012
01:34:40,323 --> 01:34:43,225
Didn't think I could do.

2013
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:46,328
And, uh,
that makes me very proud.

2014
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:50,499
Thank you.

2015
01:35:03,013 --> 01:35:04,980
I just got one more thing.

2016
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:10,986
Um...

2017
01:35:11,054 --> 01:35:13,989
We're gonna see what
kind of sense of humor

2018
01:35:14,057 --> 01:35:15,224
You guys have.

2019
01:35:18,728 --> 01:35:21,964
You know how when
I said before how, uh...

2020
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:23,632
Proud I was, you know,

2021
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,934
'cause for the first time
in my life

2022
01:35:25,001 --> 01:35:26,202
I didn't screw up?

2023
01:35:28,805 --> 01:35:31,140
Well, that's not-
that's not the whole truth.

2024
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:33,709
See, I did screw up.

2025
01:35:33,776 --> 01:35:35,945
He didn't say
anything to me.

2026
01:35:36,012 --> 01:35:37,880
Um, I forgot who I was.

2027
01:35:39,382 --> 01:35:40,782
And when I did that,

2028
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:44,286
I hurt the most important
person in my life.

2029
01:35:44,354 --> 01:35:48,157
It was the one person
who could have said, uh...

2030
01:35:48,225 --> 01:35:50,759
"hey, you know,

2031
01:35:50,827 --> 01:35:53,128
"I don't care if you're,
uh, palmer woodrow

2032
01:35:53,196 --> 01:35:55,164
Or eddie keaton. "

2033
01:35:56,933 --> 01:35:59,068
Because, uh...

2034
01:35:59,135 --> 01:36:00,769
Um...

2035
01:36:02,372 --> 01:36:04,139
Here's the joke. Ha.

2036
01:36:06,176 --> 01:36:07,476
That's who I am.

2037
01:36:08,711 --> 01:36:11,280
I'm, uh,
I'm eddie keaton

2038
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:14,016
From jersey.

2039
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:18,053
I was, uh,
I was hired

2040
01:36:18,121 --> 01:36:19,922
To play palmer woodrow.

2041
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:22,691
I did a good job, too.

2042
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:26,962
I did. Uh... I got
a cashier's check, uh...

2043
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:30,665
A red porsche.

2044
01:36:30,733 --> 01:36:34,370
I'm the kind of guy that,
uh, most of you people

2045
01:36:34,437 --> 01:36:35,771
Wouldn't let
into your house.

2046
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:39,909
And, uh...

2047
01:36:42,012 --> 01:36:44,013
And this guy, here,

2048
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:48,984
The one who's gonna give
all the money to the school,

2049
01:36:49,052 --> 01:36:51,954
He's, uh, he's a hot dog vendor
in my neighborhood.

2050
01:36:52,022 --> 01:36:53,855
woman: What?

2051
01:36:53,924 --> 01:36:59,761
And his business manager,
he's my bookie.

2052
01:37:01,464 --> 01:37:02,464
Woman: No!

2053
01:37:02,532 --> 01:37:03,799
Woman: Oh, no!

2054
01:37:06,369 --> 01:37:08,404
Well...

2055
01:37:08,471 --> 01:37:12,541
I don't know about all you,
but, uh, I feel great. Ha.

2056
01:37:12,608 --> 01:37:15,577
So if you still want
to give out these awards,

2057
01:37:15,645 --> 01:37:17,246
I think maybe
you should give one

2058
01:37:17,314 --> 01:37:19,481
To the real palmer woodrow.

2059
01:37:19,549 --> 01:37:21,417
He's, uh, he's right here.

2060
01:37:21,484 --> 01:37:23,819
There in the fourth row.

2061
01:37:23,886 --> 01:37:25,254
I think you'll
like him a lot.

2062
01:37:27,324 --> 01:37:29,825
An award? For little old me?

2063
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:31,827
Swell. Talk about
making a guy

2064
01:37:31,894 --> 01:37:33,528
Feel like part
of the team.

2065
01:37:33,596 --> 01:37:34,529
This is-thanks, eddie.

2066
01:37:34,597 --> 01:37:36,198
Remind me to send you
a christmas bomb.

2067
01:37:36,266 --> 01:37:37,366
Thanks a lot for this.

2068
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:39,335
Uh, it'll look
great in my cell,

2069
01:37:39,402 --> 01:37:41,536
And we'll see you
next year at graduation.

2070
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:43,672
Couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

2071
01:37:52,315 --> 01:37:54,749
How could you let a thing
like this happen?

2072
01:37:54,817 --> 01:37:55,951
I-I'm sorry, mother.

2073
01:37:56,019 --> 01:37:57,219
You're an idiot.

2074
01:37:57,287 --> 01:37:58,387
Yes, mother.

2075
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:04,493
There they are.
There they are!

2076
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,061
Aah! Aah!

2077
01:38:06,129 --> 01:38:07,929
Hey, look who I found.

2078
01:38:07,998 --> 01:38:09,999
My favorite woman
in the whole world.

2079
01:38:10,066 --> 01:38:11,867
You didn't have me
fooled for a minute.

2080
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:13,668
Favorite woman?

2081
01:38:13,736 --> 01:38:15,871
She's a phony, snooty
gold digger.

2082
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:17,006
I know.
Isn't she great?

2083
01:38:17,073 --> 01:38:18,207
We can talk
to each other.

2084
01:38:18,274 --> 01:38:21,310
Aah ooh! Let go of me!
I'll kill 'em!

2085
01:38:21,378 --> 01:38:24,279
I'll kill 'em.
I'll kill 'em.

2086
01:38:24,347 --> 01:38:26,215
I'll kill 'em.
I'll k-

2087
01:38:26,282 --> 01:38:27,949
I just don't know
which one to kill first.

2088
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:30,319
Tactical faux pas,
you blithering idiot.

2089
01:38:30,387 --> 01:38:31,987
This diploma
unlocks my trust fund,

2090
01:38:32,055 --> 01:38:34,289
And I can be very
generous if I want to.

2091
01:38:34,357 --> 01:38:35,590
I'm that kind of a guy.

2092
01:38:35,658 --> 01:38:36,925
I'll kill 'em!
I'll kill 'em!

2093
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:38,227
Take him away.

2094
01:38:38,294 --> 01:38:39,895
This is the most
embarrassing day

2095
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:41,296
In
hoover history.

2096
01:38:41,364 --> 01:38:42,998
Well, it's certainly
embarrassing for me.

2097
01:38:43,066 --> 01:38:44,633
Imagine some impostor.

2098
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,568
Money?

2099
01:38:46,636 --> 01:38:48,570
This is what it's all about?

2100
01:38:48,638 --> 01:38:50,572
Well, I'll just
endorse this check

2101

Over to hoover academy.

Rand: Yeah.

Hey!

Oh.

Ha ha.

2107
01:39:09,426 --> 01:39:10,792
What?

2108
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,461
Am I a total idiot?

2109
01:39:14,797 --> 01:39:16,932
I earned this money.

2110
01:39:18,168 --> 01:39:22,471
And I am going
to enjoy it.

2111
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,739
Aah! Aah!

Well, don't look at me.

Come on, rand.
This guy's my best friend.

2116
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:32,347
I'm his only friend.

2117
01:39:32,415 --> 01:39:33,348
