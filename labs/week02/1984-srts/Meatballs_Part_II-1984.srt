And I don't want you
smoking pot.

150
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,309
Ma, I might
just experiment.

151
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,245
Well, don't pay for it.

152
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,094
Hey, are those alive?

153
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,229
No, they're stuffed.

154
00:09:56,296 --> 00:10:00,133
You mean like cashews,
bread crumbs, raisins?

155

How much you want for one?

156

What have you got?

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
What's your thing, man?

161
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,059
And remember, boys
only want one thing.

162
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,160
What's wrong with that?

163
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,862
They never want it
when you want it.

164
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,145
Camp, go.

165
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,416
Four-wheel drive, man.

166
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,585
Four-wheel drive,
you numbskull.

167
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,398
Looking good,
young trooper.

168
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,837
Cease, ho.

169
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,242
That's it.
Double time, young troopers.

170
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,509
Get to those or die.

171
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,378
Pick up that
fork-nosed rifle.

172
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,383
Come on, lunge,
twist and hold.

173
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,352
Hee-yah.

174
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,687
Hee-yah.

175
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:30,090
Rip 'em from across
the craw, boy. That's it.

176
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,359
All right,
move 'em out, trooper.

177
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,265
Fine bunch of campers
this year, Foxglove.

178
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,768
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

179
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,302
I tell you,
they're naturals.

180
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,071
You'd put a pig sticker
on the end of a rifle

181
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,406
and a boy knows just
what to do with it.

182
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,479
Hmm, God,
I love it so.

183
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,613
Hmm.

184
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,915
Let's go.

185
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,223
Young whippersnapper.

186
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,902
Get outta here.

187
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,107
This place sucks.

188
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,825
Sally Friedman?
Here.

189
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,860
- Tula Washington?
- You're lookin' at her.

190
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,961
Nancy Lamon.

191
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,964
Okay now, Cabin six.

192
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,766
Which one of you boys
is Armand Carducci?

193
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,976
All right, I'll repeat myself.
Who's Armand Carducci?

194
00:12:56,043 --> 00:13:01,081
The name is Flash and it's
the only one I answer to.

195
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,549
Okay, Flash.

196
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
Now, I'm Giddy.
Uh, Coach Giddy.

197
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,787
I'm the head
counselor here.

198
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,557
Damn. I'm in charge here.

199
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,325
I got the picture.

200
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,762
Good. Now, we're not comfortable
with trouble at Sasquatch.

201
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,564
So don't give me any.

202
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,832
I hear
what you're sayin'.

203
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,834
Now I know
your reputation, Flash.

204
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,470
There's only one thing
I like about it.

205
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,805
Yeah? What's that?

206
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:29,642
How open are you to the
concept of pugilism?

207
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,846
What kind of weird shit
goes on around here?

208
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,114
I'm talking
about boxin'.

209
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,383
The sport,
fighting with rules.

210
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,385
I don't do rules.

211
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,320
I hear you're pretty
good with your hands.

212
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,654
Yeah? So what if I am?

213
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,690
Well, we got a tradition
around here.

214
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,859
It's called Champ of the Lake.
It's us against Camp Patton.

215
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,528
Camp Patton. That's the camp across the
lake, the other side there?

216
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,097
Sort of like a summer
Golden Gloves.

217
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,132
Now we got a fighter,
it's Boomer. He's great.

218
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,667
But he needs a little help, Flash.
He needs a sparring partner.

219
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,970
A real two-fisted talent, somebody like you.
What do you say?

220
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:01,241
Listen, Mr. Coach, I'm not
what you call a team player.

221
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,111
What if I said I'm tellin',
not askin'?

222
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,914
Are you?

223
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,883
No.

224
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,186
So then, why don't you
back off my case, huh?

225
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,188
I don't do
volunteer work.

226
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,091
You wanna give me
Cabin six? I'll take it.

227
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,027
The judge says
that's my sentence.

228
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,395
That's the total picture,
all right?

229
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,534
You know, if you
change your mind...

230
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,936
Forget it.

231
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,147
Trade you my
goalie stick for a Clark bar.

232
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,682
Hey, cool it, Butterball.

233
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,553
I don't do exclusives.
I gotta build up a clientele.

234
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,856
That watch quartz?

235
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,759
Yeah, but my dad
gave it to me.

236
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,464
You always get
the bed by the window.

237
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,632
But I'm the oldest.

238
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,202
That's mine.

239
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,336
It's mine.

240
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,804
Who does Mom love best?

241
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,073
Me.

242
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,341
So you wanna
take the shirt, too?

243
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,513
All right, you turkeys.

244
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,781
Shut up!

245
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,583
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,319
The name's Flash.

247
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,455
Mr. Flash.

248
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,491
And I only got one rule.

249
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,060
Don't bug me!

250
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,429
You got that,
you little twerps?

251
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,068
If you got a problem, tough,

252
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,271
don't bring it to me.
I don't do problems.

253
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,473
Mr. Flash, can we...

254
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,743
Hey, one more thing
you should know.

255
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,013
I don't do questions,
either.

256
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,164
See that, Foxglove?

257
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,799
Morons, wimps and losers.

258
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,336
Same as last year, sir.

259
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,072
This summer
we're gonna crush 'em.

260
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,041
That's the spirit, sir.

261
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,942
Is that a lisp?

262
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,544
Did I hear a lisp, Foxglove?

263
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,146
A lisp, sir?

264
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,580
Goddamn homo talk.

265
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,450
Impossible, Colonel,
we're alone.

266
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,385
Cover my back.

267
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,154
Yes, sir.

268
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,729
I was seein' this guy, real
cute, but they hated his guts.

269
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,331
And they were
drivin' me crazy.

270
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,100
Well, I was drivin'
them crazy.

271
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,702
So they decided the best
thing for me was camp.

272
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,171
You know
what I mean?

273
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,273
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

274
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,041
This one
I just couldn't resist.

275
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,209
What do you think?

276
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,710
They're really nice.

277
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,313
I couldn't
make up my mind.

278
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,016
Hey, you, uh,
wanna borrow one?

279
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,618
Gee, do you think
that'd be okay?

280
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,886
Oh, sure, I got tons.

281
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,189
What about shorts?
You got shorts?

282
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,224
Well, not exactly.

283
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,060
Here, try these.

284
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:10,163
Oh, and this goes
really cute with that.

285
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,432
Oh, Nancy, I couldn't.

286
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,201
Listen, we're sisters, right?

287
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,169
It's us against the pinkies.

288
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,970
Go on.
Okay, thanks.

289
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,609
But you...
You like me or not?

290
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,378
Yes, I like you.

291
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,413
But I think we should
set a good example.

292
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,449
Oh, well, look,
nobody knows we're here.

293
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,284
This is a great place.

294
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,453
Not like that spot
last summer?

295
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,987
Uh, no, no, no, no.

296
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,022
All those kids,
all those flash bulbs?

297
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,958
No, no, no, no, no.

298
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,026
Or that time
down at the lake?

299
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,797
Oh, Fanny, look, snakes only
come out like that once a year.

300
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,767
Are you sure we're alone?

301
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,502
Sure, look around.

302
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,339
You know, it's just getting so foggy
that I think we should go back to camp.

303
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,841
What do you mean,
it's not that foggy.

304
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,245
Oh,
we'll do it some other night.

305
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,876
Mom,
it's really creepy here.

306
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,678
I wanna go home.

307
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,815
But you'll like this camp.
Sonny, you'll see.

308
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,984
But it's not even
in our solar system.

309
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,755
Hey, don't you want to
earn your Earth Merit Badge?

310
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,157
Yes, Dad.

311
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,859
Then what's to talk?

312
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,329
Now, Sonny,
it looks like rain,

313
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,198
so be sure to wear
your little raincoat, dear.

314
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,167
But I don't want
to wear Earth clothes.

315
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,737
That's nonsense, Son.

316
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,407
You're going to be
just fine. You'll see.

317
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,808
Listen to this.

318
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,879
Who spent 325 jamochas on
English lessons for you?

319
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,080
You, Dad.

320
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,883
So, kiss your mother
goodbye.

321
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,452
Goodbye, dear.

322
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,290
And be careful
from the poison ivy.

323
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,391
Okay.

324
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,774
Good morning, Rene.

325
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,243
Ah, big day
ahead of us, huh?

326
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,380
You under control
in here?

327
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,248
But of course.
Uh-huh.

328
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,157
Some little adjustments
maybe, eh?

329
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,597
Listen to me, you crazy frog.
I want food we can eat.

330
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,466
Burgers, doggies,

331
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,601
home fries,
eggs over easy.

332
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:13,039
I'll go as far as French toast,
but nothing, nothing fancy.

333
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,246
You know where
I'm comin' from?

334
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,714
Oui, monsieur.
I don't.

335
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,424
Come on, will you?
Open up.

336
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,693
Come on, open up!

337
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,861
I'm going first.

338
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,463
You always go first.

339
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,531
Who was born first?
Me.

340
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,633
So gimme a break,
will you?

341
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,871
I gotta go!

342
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,774
Both of you?
At the same time?

343
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,241
That's sick.

344
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,416
What's the problem?

345
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,718
I think
somebody died in there.

346
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,088
Here, take this.

347
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,434
Let her rip.

348
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,253
What is it?

349
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,088
I don't know.

350
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,093
That sure is no pet.

351
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,496
- Ted's right.
- He's afraid.

352
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,600
He's not the only one.

353
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,202
Do you think maybe, like,

354
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,938
maybe he's from...

355
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,617
Are you from space?

356
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,491
Did you see that? Did you?
I mean, wow! It understood.

357
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,925
Yeah, it did.

358
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,494
It really did.

359
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,999
That sure
is a great trick.

360
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,268
Do you have a name?

361
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,808
Where are you from?

362
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,512
Me, Ted.

363
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,347
Who are you?

364
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,484
Me Ted.

365
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,952
What did he say?

366
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,154
I think he said meathead.

367
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,656
Meathead.

368
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,390
Meathead?

369
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,259
Meathead's what he said.

370
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,327
Meathead.

371
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:27,634
Listen, uh, Meathead,
we won't hurt you or anything.

372
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,870
We're just, well,
you know, curious.

373
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:34,941
We've never seen a...
A something like you before.

374
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,743
Look, we gotta
go for breakfast.

375
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,578
Do you want us to
bring anything back?

376
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,847
Uh, Big Mac.

377
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,783
How does he know about
Big Macs?

378
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,952
Think he's got a guidebook?

379
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,089
Right.

380
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,824
But he does, seriously.

381
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,093
Okay, ladies...

382
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,795
On the toes.
Come on.

383
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,832
Hurry up, we're late.

384
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,701
Just put this.

385
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,535
Hurry. Will you hurry?

386
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,337
Put your head back.

387
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,949
Hi, girls.
What's happening?

388
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,120
My name's Flash.
What's yours?

389
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,823
Don't talk to him,
Cheryl, he's a dork.

390
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,860
I'm not a dork,
I'm Italian.

391
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,901
Other way.

392
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,338
Hey, Flash.

393
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,274
Nah, I'm just lookin'.

394
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,644
Come on, come on,
come over here.

395
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,852
Did you ever
put the gloves on?

396
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,521
Where I come from,
fighters don't have time for dressin' up.

397
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,224
Besides, I'm just lookin'.

398
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,393
Kick 'em high, ladies.

399
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,895
Up, up, up.

400
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,799
Hey, Boomer. Boomer.

401
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,500
This is Flash.

402
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,802
The kid with
the reputation.

403
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,704
Oh, yeah.
Uh, hey, Flash.

404
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,272
How's it goin'?

405
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,074
Uh, pretty slow.

406
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,976
I can believe it.

407
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,045
What is that,
some kind of crack, uh, Bash?

408
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,246
Flash.

409
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,815
Oh, yeah.

410
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:58,985
Hey, you know, Mash, you got
a pretty good sense of humor.

411
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,452
You know what I'm gonna do?

412
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,889
I'm gonna knock
it right outta your head.

413
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,657
Wham, bam. Wham.

414
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,859
What do you think of that?

415
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,064
You wanna try?

416
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,767
Sure. I love fightin'.

417
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:20,807
Put 'em on.

418
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,208
All right.

419
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,910
Kick 'em high, ladies.

420
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,611
Up, up, up.

421
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,413
Raise those thighs.

422
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,553
Well, you take it easy.
Keep your guard up, huh?

423
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,523
Nothin' fancy.

424
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,162
Come on.

425
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,198
Right here.
Right here.

426
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,834
Come on.

427
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,402
You gotta do
better than that, Bash.

428
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,674
That's all
for today, ladies.

429
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:13,860
Let's go.

430
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,599
Hey, Trash.

431
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,904
Hey, didn't anybody ever tell
you boxing and broads don't mix?

432
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,206
That guy really is a dork.

433
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:28,440
A what?

434
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,777
A dork. You know, dork.

435
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,946
Oh, yeah, sure, a dork.

436
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:38,184
Hey, like, you know, you know,
you're a pretty good fighter, Crash.

437
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,353
Thanks. You're not so bad
yourself, Bloomer.

438
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,590
My name is Boomer.

439
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,159
What are you,
makin' fun of me again?

440
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,797
Oh, I'm sorry.

441
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:55,001
Nancy, will Flash
always be a dork?

442
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,073
You really don't know
what it is, do you?

443
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,274
A dork.

444
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,743
You know, like in,
joystick?

445
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,413
Heater, wang,
pud, equipment?

446
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,783
Uh, pinkie.

447
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,152
Oh, that's what it is.

448
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,653
So you didn't know,
right?

449
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,023
Well, I mean, I knew...
You ever seen one?

450
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,858
Sure. Lots of times.

451
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,828
What, you got a brother
or something?

452
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:22,929
No.

453
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,932
A boyfriend?

454
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,699
Well, not really.

455
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,569
Well then, who?

456
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,737
"Who" what?

457
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:33,639
Whose did you see?

458
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,241
Oh.

459
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,444
Look, come with me and I'll show
you a couple of real doozers.

460
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,282
Oh, my God.

461
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,085
Try not to
have a heart attack.

462
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,221
Ooh, boy, he is
really somethin'.

463
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,057
I've seen
bigger though.

464
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,825
You mean, they come
in different sizes?

465
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,261
Haven't
you ever seen one?

466
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,897
Hey, guess
who's never seen...

467
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,631
Oh, nice going.

468
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,134
What did I say?

469
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,974
What'd I say?

470
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,309
Whoa!

471
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,444
I've never seen
one that big before.

472
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,180
You've never
seen one period.

473
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,015
Have, too. My brother.

474
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,683
Yeah, but he's five.

475
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,385
No, he's six.

476
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,091
You know, Tula didn't
mean anything by that.

477
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,459
It's just that...

478
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,496
Well, you act like you've been
in a convent your whole life.

479
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,164
Well, I haven't.

480
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,201
It's just that

481
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,637
we don't discuss
those sort of things.

482
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,607
And nobody ever even
talked to you about it?

483
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,144
You mean S-E-X?

484
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,446
Don't tell me, like,
they always spelled it out?

485
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,680
Always.

486
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,149
Oh, brother.

487
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,487
You don't know anything,
do you?

488
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,590
Come on.

489
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,061
Okay, you guys, listen up.

490
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:06,865
You know, like, there was a time,
not so long ago I might add,

491
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:10,236
when all of us were just
as deprived as Cheryl here.

492
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:13,105
So I say that
we gotta help her.

493
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,908
I say that
we take a pledge

494
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,611
that before camp ends...

495
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,480
She sees a pinkie!

496
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,183
All right.

497
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,551
Are you sure?
Yes.

498
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,519
What's goin' on in here?

499
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,521
Nothin'.

500
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,291
Is that a fact?

501
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,462
Oh.

502
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:40,132
Whose is this?

503
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,938
No matter.
It's confiscated.

504
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,408
Just remember, ladies,

505
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:52,378
that this is a cabin
for proper young women.

506
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,949
There will be
no talk of pinkies.

507
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,985
They're not play things,
you know.

508
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,619
They're weapons.

509
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,821
Dangerous weapons.

510
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,957
Like loaded guns.

511
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:08,560
They can go off when
you least expect it.

512
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,796
Do I make
myself clear?

513
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,532
Yes, Fanny.

514
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,600
Good.

515
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:27,446
Oh, what a beautiful day.

516
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:31,683
You really think so, do you?

517
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,587
Boomer. Boomer. Boomer.

518
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,855
Boomer!

519
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,192
Uh, hey, Giddy, that you?

520
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,329
I can't see. I got
a canoe on my head.

521
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,232
I noticed. Boomer, please,
the lake's the other way.

522
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,733
Oh, thanks, Giddy.

523
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,635
Don't mention it.

524
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:56,608
Giddy.

525
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,411
I'm going lose...

526
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,646
Oh, oh!

527
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,091
I think I got
a fish in my pants.

528
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,594
Oh, no, wait,
it's just me.

529
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh, what's it called?

530
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,836
Kybo. K-Y-B-O.
Keep your bowels open.

531
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,238
They were supposed to
burn them

532
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,507
when they switched over
to what we have now.

533
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,042
I mean,
no one will come here.

534
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,610
It's totally safe.

535
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,712
Yeah, I can believe it.

536
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,781
So what you think,
Meathead?

537
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,649
Kybo, huh? Okay.

538
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,320
That one.
I like that one.

539
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,521
Quarter-moon.

540
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,022
Good choice.

541
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,225
Thank you.
Oh, did somebody fart?

542
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,293
Oh.

543
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,140
Move 'em out.

544
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,377
Ten, hut!

545
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,282
Two fingers off the bridge
of the nose, young trooper.

546
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,188
Ten, hut!

547
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,956
Chief Rawhide's
here to see you, sir.

548
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,659
Hmm. Is he wearin'
those damn feathers?

549
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,895
Yes, sir. Accented by
some lovely little beads.

550
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:25,964
A lisp.

551
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,467
God damn it.
Foxglove, I heard a lisp.

552
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,502
I'll check into it, sir.

553
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,605
I hate feathers.

554
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:39,978
Bitch.

555
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,760
How?
Who?

556
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,927
Where?
Here.

557
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:56,995
What?

558
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,096
Rights to lake.

559
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,234
No acid rain.

560
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,635
Good.

561
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,404
No PCBs.

562
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,472
Great.

563
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,440
Clear like mountain stream.

564
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:09,541
I love it.

565
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,909
Many fish.
Hmm.

566
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,678
Wind surfing potential.

567
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,180
Ah-ha.
Good deal.

568
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,247
Hmm.

569
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,150
You make fair trade.

570
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,486
I'm a fair guy, Chief.

571
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,720
Honest Injun.

572
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,058
Injun.

573
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,201
Attention.

574
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,046
Good morning, Colonel.

575
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,515
You call these
ankle biters campers, Giddy?

576
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,116
My God,
it's worse than last year!

577
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,653
It's a goddamn
waste of human potential.

578
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,621
Listen to me,
you pipsqueak

579
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,624
pistol packin' package
of paramilitary paranoia...

580
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,527
How do you say that
so fast?

581
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,664
I hear what you're
saying, Colonel.

582
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,341
Well, of course,
you can hear me.

583
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:52,978
We're only
six inches apart.

584
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,282
No, no, no, no, I mean, I mean, I...
I respect your space.

585
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,883
I know where
you're comin' from.

586
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,352
Oh, don't give me that
communication bullshit, Giddy.

587
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,154
I'm here on a mission
and I will not be heard!

588
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,056
I mean,
you will not hear me.

589
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,659
You... Well, I'll tell you
where I'm comin' from, Giddy.

590
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,029
I'm comin' from my lake!
Show him the papers, Foxglove.

591
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,364
Yes, sir.

592
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,667
It's mine. All mine!

593
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,536
From shore to shore.

594
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,670
Men!

595
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,544
You mean, the Chief sold you...
But I... Wait a minute.

596
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,246
Well, what good is my
camp without a lake?

597
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:32,784
Exactly my point, Counselor.
This year's Champ Sunday is gonna be your last.

598
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,152
Foxglove!

599
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,622
Wait, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel.
Please, please.

600
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,491
Let's...
Could we discuss this over lunch?

601
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,161
Lunch? You're nuts.

602
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,098
We're gonna pave
this place, Foxglove.

603
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,167
We're gonna wall-to-wall
concrete it.

604
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,902
We're gonna flank it
with howitzers,

605
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,540
and we're gonna bring a whole
goddamn division of T-47s right here.

606
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,375
Relax. Relax.

607
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,877
I can handle this.

608
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,480
I can.

609
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,045
I hope he's okay.

610
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,914
It was your big idea.

611
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,759
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
It's only me. Sorry.

612
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,294
What are you
doing here?

613
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,962
I came to tell you
I'm okay.

614
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,931
Hey, what's goin' on
out there?

615
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,766
Uh-oh, be cool, guys.
Be cool.

616
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,067
Sorry, Mr. Flash.

617
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,936
Easy, Barry, tell him
you're just scared.

618
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,037
Just...
Scared.

619
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,171
Scared.

620
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,973
Your mothers will be
a whole lot sorrier

621
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,975
if the Flash misses out
on his sleep.

622
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,811
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

623
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,413
Hit the sheets.

624
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:15,421
Meathead, you gotta start
using the door around here.

625
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,589
You okay?

626
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:21,026
Was that close, guys,
or was that close?

627
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,894
Oh, I've seen closer.

628
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,797
Well, maybe not that close.

629
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,374
What the goddamn hell is
that, Foxglove?

630
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,112
Sounds like tambourines.

631
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,095
Whoa, Marcel.

632
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,568
Whoa, Havoc.

633
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,924
Colonel, what
a pleasant surprise.

634
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,527
Don't give me that bleeding
heart routine, Giddy.

635
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,829
I wanna know...
Wanna know what those... Priests.

636
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,263
Priests.
What are they doing?

637
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,232
Praying. Praying?
What are they praying for?

638
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,433
Likely a new home.

639
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,968
Home? Home, what home?

640
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,505
God's truth, Giddy.
What have you done?

641
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,973
Like I said, Colonel,
what good's a camp with no lake?

642
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,141
But a temple.

643
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,243
Huh, temple? No.

644
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,545
No!

645
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,213
Yeah, I'm goin' back
to the urban ghettos.

646
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,216
Poverty, crime, trash,
disease, honest work.

647
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,018
Look, you can't do that.

648
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,753
I've had good years here.

649
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,922
Wonderful kids.
Some success stories.

650
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,356
I wanna give
something back.

651
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,726
These people need a place
to let their sheets down.

652
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,494
Hey, Giddy, no,
you can't do it.

653
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:03,995
You can't do it.
You can't!

654
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,664
These people,

655
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:08,800
I hear they wipe with
their bare hands.

656
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,402
That's just it.
They don't use water.

657
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,476
Giddy. Hey, Giddy, look,
I'll be the first to admit I've been rash.

658
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,446
Oh, now, wait.
Here comes one of them now.

659
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,549
Hi, Your Excellence.
Come in.

660
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:25,817
Oh, Giddy,
are you outta your mind?

661
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,252
Your Excellence,

662
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,555
please shake hands with a good friend of
mine, Colonel Hershy.

663
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,390
I love you.

664
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,860
Oh, get him...
Get him outta here, Giddy.

665
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,361
Your Excellence,
Your Excellence,

666
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,230
five minutes and then we'll
finish the paperwork. Okay?

667
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,635
Giddy.

668
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,604
Giddy, Giddy, please.
You've got to listen to me.

669
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,607
Part of me hears what you say
and then part of me doesn't.

670
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,909
Jackboots and marching tunes
are a thing of the past.

671
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:53,278
Bare feet and mantras are
taking over the country.

672
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,447
Oh, no, not you, Giddy.

673
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,117
Now listen.
There's gotta be some way.

674
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,654
There's always
Champ of the Lake.

675
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,658
Champ of the Lake?

676
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,959
What are you talkin' about?
Make sense, Giddy.

677
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,795
Our last fight, Colonel.

678
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,530
How about I hold off the sale?
Would you like that?

679
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,132
You're damn right
I'd like that.

680
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,501
You raise the stakes
on Champ of the Lake,

681
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,604
I'll put a hold on their deal.

682
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,772
Raise the stakes?
Sure I'll raise 'em.

683
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,540
Christ, Giddy, you name it.

684
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:26,177
My camp for your water
rights, all or nothing.

685
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,580
The whole shootin' match?

686
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,115
Kit and caboodle.

687
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,683
Lock, stock and barrel?

688
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,851
The works.

689
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,485
From here to eternity?

690
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,487
The whole enchilada.

691
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,090
Damn it, I'll take it.

692
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:42,060
I'll take
the whole goddamn thing.

693
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,630
Foxglove!

694
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,802
Hook, line and sinker.

695
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,340
All right,
Mr. Dumbjohn.

696
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,441
Yeah?

697
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,109
I know what this is.

698
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,711
What does this mean?

699
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:03,148
This one's for you,
this one's for the horse you rode in on.

700
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:11,422
Hey, hands off that horse.
That's my horse.

701
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,992
Ah-ha, I knew
it would feed an army.

702
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,327
Why, you...

703
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,840
Didn't I tell you campers,
no smokin'?

704
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:30,175
Didn't I?

705
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:33,945
Didn't I?

706
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,247
I should hope so.
Filthy habit.

707
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,449
The Colonel's
expecting you.

708
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,287
Despot.

709
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,696
You called, sir?

710
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:52,330
Of course,
I'm called "sir!"

711
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,632
I'm a bloody colonel,
aren't I?

712
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,535
Yes, sir.

713
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:03,341
Sergeant Paladin, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

714
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,443
is to sound off
like you got a pair,

715
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,112
move out
like you had a purpose,

716
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:09,314
grab your squad,
hit that assault craft,

717
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,952
cross that lake and
neutralize this idiot

718
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,487
with extreme prejudice.

719
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:34,539
The ancient Sasquatch Indians used to
boogie to this one and now so can you!

720
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,842
Are you
gonna be okay here?

721
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,343
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Okay.

722
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,419
I wanna dance.

723
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,188
Oh, yeah? With what?

724
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,057
I want somethin' tall,
lean and mean.

725
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:28,894
There's a horse outside,
why don't you go get it?

726
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,461
I ain't into
that sort of thing.

727
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,230
That's not what I heard.

728
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,070
Have you been talkin'
about me again?

729
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,508
I don't care. Those guys are
always talkin' about me. So what?

730
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,776
So what?

731
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:51,983
You wanna dance?

732
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,353
Shit.

733
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,841
Cheryl, uh,

734
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,210
I, uh...

735
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:22,213
Can you talk?

736
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,015
Yes.

737
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:27,986
Oh, it just seems like you're not
that heavily into conversation.

738
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:30,421
Oh, well,
I'm just not used to it.

739
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,824
With boys, I mean.

740
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,226
Well, you can
practice on me.

741
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,327
Okay.

742
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,763
Flash,

743
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,299
people, they talk,
you know, and...

744
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:43,201
Well, they say
you're sort of mean.

745
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,369
Oh, yeah?

746
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,804
Just tell me
who it is and I'll...

747
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,307
I mean, did they
really say that?

748
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,843
About me?

749
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,546
Nah, I can't
figure that out.

750
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:59,150
I mean, how many mean
altar boys have you met?

751
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,452
You're an altar boy?

752
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,589
Are you kiddin'?
Me and the rabbi are like this.

753
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,058
Rabbi?

754
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:10,228
Oh, uh, well, see,
that's what I call...

755
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:14,232
As a matter of fact, he can't kiss nothin'
unless the Flash checks it out first.

756
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:18,203
Like the robes and
the cups and the crosses

757
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,738
and shit like that.

758
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,377
Listen, uh, you wanna get
some holy water or somethin'?

759
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:28,779
Okay.

760
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,582
All right.

761
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,012
Yep,
that's him all right.

762
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,881
You want me
to drop him?

763
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,551
Get a grip on yourself,
we got orders.

764
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,495
Okay, men,
let's move out.

765
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,044
Psst.

766
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,714
Hey, come here.

767
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,316
Hey, who is that?

768
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:39,784
It's me, Boomer!

769
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,486
Oh.

770
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,892
Hey, I'm Boomer.

771
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,473
So will you do it?

772
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,910
I don't know. I mean,
streaking's not such a big deal anymore.

773
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:09,347
Believe me, for some people
it'll be a major deal.

774
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:13,284
So, uh,
what do I get for pullin' it off?

775
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,190
Okay. You talked me into it.

776
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:21,826
Don't forget,
it's Cabin 10.

777
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,534
Come on, Fanny,
I got the perfect place.

778
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,695
You seen Boomer?

779
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,311
Hi, Jamie, Fanny.

780
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,414
Have you seen Boomer?

781
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:17,515
Boomer?

782
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:19,317
No, he's not here.

783
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:21,186
No, he's not here.

784
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,624
Oh, Fanny, I'm sorry.

785
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,798
Okay, here you go!

786
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:04,762
Give me the other one.

787
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,364
Okay, okay.

788
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:09,927
Fanny?

789
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,789
Fanny?

790
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,658
Jamie?

791
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,361
Ta-da!

792
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,231
Oh, shit!

793
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,233
Hey, Meat, what you doin'?
What's happenin'?

794
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,068
Lookin' for somethin' to do.

795
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,336
Why the raincoat?

796
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:27,104
Oh, it's gonna rain.

797
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:29,407
Good, Meat,
be prepared.

798
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,246
Hey, look!

799
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,248
Hey,
he's doin' it again.

800
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:42,487
Hey, Meathead, come on.
You gotta act sorta normal around here.

801
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:47,191
You can't walk through stuff or people
are gonna know you're, uh, different.

802
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,427
Yeah, you're right.
You guys go ahead.

803
00:53:49,494 --> 00:53:52,162
I'm gonna practice
walkin' around stuff.

804
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,231
So long, Meat.

805
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:56,000
See you later.

806
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,935
Okay.

807
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:01,606
Gee, I wonder when I'm gonna
get to play basketball.

808
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,107
Or use a bow and arrow.

809
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,609
Somethin'. Anything.

810
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,645
Hey guys.

811
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:46,183
Uh, uh, excuse me.

812
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:10,841
Here.

813
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:22,219
Flash,
why are you a dork?

814
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,091
Are you for real?

815
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,326
Yes. Are you for real?

816
00:55:29,394 --> 00:55:31,195
No, no. I meant...

817
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:34,799
Forget it.

818
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,535
Flash, don't be afraid.

819
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,004
Me afraid?

820
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,007
Hey, I'm heavily into rockets

821
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,075
and saucers,

822
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,545
and well, creatures.

823
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,618
You guys
know about this?

824
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,085
I mean, him?

825
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,123
Wait a second.

826
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,858
How long has he been here?

827
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:02,993
A few weeks.

828
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,829
And I didn't notice?

829
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:13,738
Uh, I guess I wouldn't have.

830
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,706
Nobody else has either.

831
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,344
I don't know.

832
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,480
He's no trouble.

833
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:25,049
We promise
we won't let him bug you.

834
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,121
Flash, call me Meathead.

835
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:36,226
Okay, Meathead.

836
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,896
I'll take a shot.

837
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,834
Uh, you know, you're
not such a dork, Flash.

838
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,364
Hey, Boomer, what gives?

839
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,200
He's goin' bozo, Crash.

840
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,736
I told him
I still got a right.

841
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,437
You gotta stop him, Crash.

842
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:22,807
They're gonna hurt him
worser than me.

843
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,208
You don't mean he's gonna...

844
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,910
Yeah. You gotta
tell him, Flash.

845
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,945
See, I don't need
no knuckles to fight.

846
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:30,748
I don't need no hands or feet either.
You know why?

847
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:34,218
Because I'm gonna beat him
with my brains. That's right.

848
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:38,956
I got more brains in my little
finger than I do in my whole head.

849
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,930
Take it easy, will you?

850
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:47,498
I gotta think.

851
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:49,767
Yeah, you're
lucky that way.

852
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,577
Look, I wanna fight.

853
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:02,847
What?

854
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,282
Champ of the Lake.
I'll take it.

855
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:08,252
Thanks, Flash,
but it's my fight now.

856
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:18,062
I'm your fighter.

857
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:21,866
I thought the Flash
don't do volunteer work.

858
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,568
Yeah. Well, that's a fact,

859
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,603
but sometimes
a situation comes up

860
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,039
that calls for a little
of the Flash's specialty.

861
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,075
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

862
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,277
You?

863
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,679
Yeah, me.

864
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:35,980
Champ of the Lake?

865
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,147
Yeah.

866
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:40,685
I think I like it.

867
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:41,786
All right!

868
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,288
All right!

869
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,492
All right, Giddy!
Way to go!

870
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:00,204
Here you go, boy.

871
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:03,407
Ooh, yeah, Mad Dog. Ah!

872
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,675
Ooh, Mad Dog, Mad Dog.

873
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,144
Bad Mad Dog.

874
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,513
Get outta here.

875
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,282
I wonder what Giddy's
got up his sleeve.

876
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,452
We need information,
Paladin.

877
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,787
Sir?

878
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:17,955
I want a prisoner.

879
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,289
Yes, sir!

880
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,295
Not one of ours,
you tank tread!

881
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,397
One of theirs!

882
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,936
A goddamn
red-blooded Sasquatch!

883
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:33,070
Yes, sir!

884
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:23,053
Hey, Flash.

885
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:27,257
What do you want?

886
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,827
Listen, I feel sorta
funny about doin' this.

887
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,096
Doin' what?

888
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,964
Cheryl would kill me.

889
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,300
What for?

890
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,202
But I'm doin' it for her.

891
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:40,871
Of course you are.
What are you doin'?

892
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:44,875
Well, she wondered
if you'd...

893
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,744
Oh, I shouldn't.

894
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,779
Yeah, she wondered what?

895
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:52,149
If you'd go
skinny-dipping tonight.

896
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:53,784
Me?

897
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,786
I knew I shouldn't.

898
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,454
Me and her?

899
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,489
Yeah. Alone.

900
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:01,992
Tonight?

901
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,660
Down by the cove?

902
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,164
Okay.

903
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:09,399
Tell her I'll meet her there.

904
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:18,008
Tonight?

905
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:20,544
The shooting stars.

906
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,247
He wants you
to watch with him.

907
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,149
The stars?

908
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:28,753
You know, like the Big
Dipper and stuff like that?

909
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,054
The Big Dipper?

910
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,930
Now remember, men,

911
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:42,032
this is not
an ordinary mission,

912
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,968
this is the mission!

913
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,635
You all got
your cyanide capsules?

914
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,771
Mmm-hmm.

915
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,607
All right. Now you people are
the finest counterinsurgency team

916
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,709
I've ever trained
here at Patton.

917
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:54,211
I don't want you
screwin' it up!

918
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:55,746
You read me?

919
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:57,081
Yes, sir!

920
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,116
Move 'em out!

921
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:07,758
I want you to go through those Sasquatch
creeps like crap through a goose!

922
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:11,195
By God, you pull this off

923
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:14,731
and there'll be ice cream
for dessert tomorrow!

924
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:26,343
A great night
for shooting stars.

925
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,179
Yeah, and, uh,
shooting moons?

926
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:32,082
Well, where do you
ever see a shooting moon?

927
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:34,651
Mostly out
of car windows.

928
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,761
We got the best view.

929
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,231
Hey, you guys,
here comes Cheryl.

930
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:53,971
Hi.

931
01:02:54,038 --> 01:02:55,539
Hi.

932
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,241
I'm glad you came.

933
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:58,675
Well, I didn't wanna
miss it.

934
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,577
Yeah, me neither.

935
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,647
What's happening down there?

936
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,115
Shh, you want them to hear us?
No.

937
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:06,683
Look at there!
Lookie, quick. Look, look.

938
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:09,453
It's all new to me,
you know?

939
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,355
Yeah, I kinda guessed that.

940
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,393
Do you mind explaining
as we go?

941
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,528
Sure. No problem.

942
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:19,864
Oh, good.

943
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,933
This is called first base.

944
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,235
Where? I don't see it.

945
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:27,071
Sorry.

946
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:30,607
Look,

947
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:33,343
I thought I was gonna see
the Big Dipper.

948
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,811
Yeah, we'll get to that.

949
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,146
Well, where is it?

950
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:37,581
Oh, my God.

951
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,558
Okay, this is it.

952
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,028
It's a nice spot.
Really secluded.

953
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:54,031
Are you sure it's safe?

954
01:03:54,098 --> 01:03:56,700
Does a bear
shit in the woods?

955
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,111
So you ready?

956
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,278
For what?

957
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,080
To go in the water.

958
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:12,216
The water?

959
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:14,584
Can you see better
from the water?

960
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:16,020
Absolutely.

961
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:19,556
Oh, please.

962
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:23,227
You go over there
and I'll go over here

963
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,529
and I'll meet you
in the water.

964
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:30,200
Okay.

965
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,003
I trust you, Flash.

966
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:37,942
Water?

967
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:41,111
Shh!

968
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:44,949
What is this?

969
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,683
Oh, what is that?

970
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,453
It's my compass.
It always points north.

971
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,858
Boy, what a show.

972
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,065
What's he doin'?

973
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:03,267
He just dropped his drawers.

974
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,052
Did you hear somethin'?

975
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:28,425
How can you see better
from the water?

976
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:39,469
Flash?

977
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,409
Stop pushing me.

978
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:48,112
You stop shovin' me
and I'll stop pushin' you.

979
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:54,118
Oh, Fanny.

980
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:56,686
It feels like a rock!

981
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:59,656
Oh, it is a rock.

982
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,038
Flash, is that you?

983
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,275
What the...

984
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,145
Flash?

985
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,696
There's a bear!

986
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,052
Uh, maybe we should
find a new place.

987
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:40,224
Hi.

988
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,291
Hi.

989
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:42,992
Have you seen Flash anywhere?

990
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,662
No, not since last night.

991
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,534
Where is he?

992
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:49,826
He's ready, Paladin.

993
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,230
He's ready,
aren't you, big fella?

994
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,355
Where is he?

995
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:19,423
He's ready.

996
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,524
Where is he?

997
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,392
Paladin, where is he?

998
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,195
Hey, Giddy! Come here.

999
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,369
Come here.

1000
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,342
I want you
to meet Mad Dog.

1001
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,178
All right, heel, back!

1002
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,582
Where's your boy?

1003
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,050
He'll be along anytime now.

1004
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,185
Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

1005
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:51,020
I'm sure.

1006
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:10,674
That is my dress.

1007
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,613
Easy. Easy.

1008
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,531
Flash look pretty.

1009
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:42,739
Put 'em on.

1010
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:54,418
Where have you been?
Some kind of private party?

1011
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:56,219
Who am I fightin'?

1012
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:57,321
It.

1013
01:10:58,555 --> 01:11:00,056
You're dead.
Yeah.

1014
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:01,525
You're dead.

1015
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,694
Why is he wearing that?

1016
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,463
I don't know.

1017
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,632
You're lookin' good,
Flash.

1018
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,935
All right, listen up!

1019
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,603
Now, this is gonna be
a fair fight.

1020
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,873
Throw any weird punches and I'm gonna
be forced to get physical with you.

1021
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,243
Any questions?

1022
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,678
All right, shake hands.

1023
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,850
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1024
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,852
Get mad, Mad Dog!
Come on, kill, kill, kill!

1025
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:15,899
Kill him.

1026
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:24,007
Stop him! Stop him!

1027
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,075
Get him, Mad Dog!

1028
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:29,312
What are you doin'?

1029
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:30,380
Disgusting!

1030
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:31,648
Flash!

1031
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:34,651
Get off of me, you fruit,
and fight like a man!

1032
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:36,686
Foul! Make war, not love!

1033
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:05,915
Flash, look out!

1034
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,223
You all right?

1035
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,625
Look, stay away from him.

1036
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:16,760
I'm stayin'.
Keep movin'.

1037
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:18,227
I'm movin'.

1038
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,940
Come back in here! You can't get away with it.
Come on, get back in here!

1039
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,509
Come on, get in here!

1040
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,711
I'm gonna kill you! Come on!

1041
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:37,113
Yeah, little fruit,
get on back in there!

1042
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,482
Take your medicine!

1043
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:58,334
One, two,
three, four, five...

1044
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,020
Okay, Mad Dog, I want
you to stop fartin' around.

1045
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,822
I want you to put him away,
you hear me?

1046
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,223
Get mad.
Get mad, Mad Dog.

1047
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,527
Yeah.
That's a good boy.

1048
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:25,261
Where am I?

1049
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,330
Hey, come on, Mash.

1050
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:30,233
Hey, Bloomer!

1051
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:34,604
Uh, Fanny,
I know a place.

1052
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,973
Please, I got it all
figured out.

1053
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,742
Whatever you have got
figured out

1054
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,677
does not include me!

1055
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:42,879
Fanny, please, I love them.

1056
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:44,013
Them?

1057
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,181
Uh, I mean, you.

1058
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:04,433
Jab, jab, jab!

1059
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,638
Keep runnin'.

1060
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,082
That's it,
move, move, move!

1061
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,451
In the la bonzai!

1062
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,564
Do you think he'll get up?

1063
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:38,201
One,
two, three, four...

1064
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,736
Come on, Cash, kid,
get up!

1065
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,605
Yeah. Come on, Flash!

1066
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,216
Wow!

1067
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:55,885
Wha...

1068
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:57,687
What kind
of bull is this?

1069
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,692
Come on, Flash!

1070
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:04,293
Attaboy, Flash!

1071
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,333
Come on, Mad Dog!

1072
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,635
Sic him!

1073
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:26,983
God, he really is a fairy.

1074
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,652
What's goin' on?

1075
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:34,390
You didn't tell us
he could fly.

1076
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:01,350
Come on, Flash, come on!

1077
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:02,986
Come on!

1078
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,721
Come on! Get down.

1079
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:09,492
All right!

1080
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:14,497
Hey, Giddy, how come
you never taught me that?

1081
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:18,167
Come on, big boy.
What you gonna do now, huh?

1082
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:19,869
Come on, come on.

1083
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:28,111
Hey, get down from there!

1084
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,213
Hey, Ref!

1085
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:33,582
Get outta here!

1086
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,819
Get down!
That's against the rules!

1087
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:37,787
Don't you dare
tear that dress, buddy!

1088
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:39,789
Come down from there!

1089
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:48,231
Hi, Cheryl,
what's happenin'?

1090
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,202
Ref, get him down! Get him down!
It's illegal! No flying!

1091
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:56,005
It's against the rules
of war. No flying!

1092
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,446
Get him down!

1093
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,614
Foul! Foul!

1094
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,121
Get him down!
Get him down!

1095
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:19,095
You can do it!

1096
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,400
Aliens.

1097
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:04,240
Oh!

1098
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:09,278
One,
two, three, four...

1099
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,779
Oh, Flash, Flash,
come up!

1100
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:46,782
Hey!

1101
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:48,117
Hey, Ref!

1102
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:18,414
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1103
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,566
Ha, ha!
I knew it!
I knew it!

1104
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:55,151
Now that is what
you call a pinkie!

1105
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,861
It's all right, Flash.

1106
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:08,131
No wonder
they call him Flash.

1107
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,244
Giddy, be reasonable.
What good is a camp without a lake?

1108
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,746
Colonel, I'm sensitive to your
needs, but a deal's a deal.

1109
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,348
Oh, deal!
Hold it, hold it!

1110
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:27,516
I hear where you're
coming from, Giddy,

1111
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:30,353
but I've ordered a
submarine for next year.

1112
01:21:30,419 --> 01:21:32,788
Colonel, you really have
to refocus your energies.

1113
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,890
Now, look, this winter
I'm offering a workshop.

1114
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,993
New directions
in lifestyle orientations.

1115
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,561
You can't do this to me!

1116
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:39,862
Giddy!

1117
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,830
I'm warning you,
I'll be back!

1118
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,233
Next summer, Giddy,
I'm gonna be back!

1119
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:48,671
And I'll be back, Giddy!

1120
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:53,576
So you like your present,
Meathead?

1121
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:56,612
Oh, yes, Steve,
it's really great.

1122
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:58,781
Hello?
Anybody home?

1123
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,918
Hey, Meathead,
they're here.

1124
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:05,788
Well, goodbye, guys.

1125
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,290
Nice knowin' you,
Meathead.

1126
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:08,924
Goodbye, Meathead.

1127
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,859
Goodbye, Meathead.

1128
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:14,030
Come on, Meathead.

1129
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,631
Meathead!

1130
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:17,200
Meathead!

1131
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,272
Oh, I know.

1132
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:28,544
Hmm.

1133
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:41,457
Well, so we say at home,
goot-a-bye, mulas.

1134
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,667
Well, Mr. I-don't-want-to-
go-to-summer-camp,

1135
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,169
did you have
a good time?

1136
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:54,837
Oh, it was really great, Dad.

1137
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,172
Did you have
