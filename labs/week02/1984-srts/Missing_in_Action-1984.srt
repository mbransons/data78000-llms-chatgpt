1
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:46,518
Move it! Move it!

2
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:50,733
- Hang on, Junior! Take it easy!
- Come on! Come on!

3
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:03,964
Move it!

4
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:11,603
Come on! Come on!

5
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,649
Through here! Through here!

6
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,187
Gotta cross this! Let's go!

7
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,798
Let's go!

8
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:04,069
Keep it moving!

9
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:09,912
Move it!

10
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,968
Come on!

11
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:32,118
Come on, soldier!

12
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,359
Choppers!
- Quickly! Go!

13
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,293
Let's go!

14
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,929
Behind you!

15
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,117
Come on! Get in! Get in!

16
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,459
- Let's go! Let's get outta here!
- Go, go, go!

17
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,128
Wait!

18
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,471
Get in!

19
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:24,605
Over here!

20
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,103
Get up! Get up!

21
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,278
Let's go! Let's go!
Get your ass up in the air!

22
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,532
Get out the way, damn it!

23
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,706
All right, we're ready! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!

24
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:35,978
Come on! Keep going!

25
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:44,952
Move it!

26
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:50,963
- Hurry up, godammit!
- Give me your hand!

27
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:53,301
Take off! Take off! Go! Go! Go!

28
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,205
Move it!

29
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:34,956
Aah!

30
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,713
He won't try that shit again!

31
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,884
Griffin, get him out of here!

32
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,434
God...!

33
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,880
...American servicemen
missing in action. Bill?

34
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:28,342
Thanks, Jane.

35
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,681
Preparations for a high-/eve/ meeting
with the Vietnamese continue today

36
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:35,144
as a senate delegation made ready
to leave for Ho Chi Minh City.

37
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,857
The primary purpose of the talks
is to determine whether or not

38
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:42,323
American servicemen are still being
held as prisoners of war in Vietnam.

39
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,996
In recent months, American veterans'
organizations have increased demands

40
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:49,753
for information regarding
some 2,500 American servicemen

41
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,341
who did not return home
from the war in Vietnam.

42
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,849
The fate of these Missing In Action
Americans still remains uncertain today.

43
00:09:57,017 --> 00:10:00,314
Reported sightings of foreign
prisoners being held in Vietnam

44
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,323
have resulted in greater efforts to
resolve the MIA issue once and for all.

45
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,036
Senator Maxwell Porter, head
of the US delegation to Vietnam,

46
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:11,625
expressed guarded optimism
that talks would result

47
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,588
in shedding some light
on this unresolved issue.

48
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:16,382
But we're cautioned,
however, that progress

49
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,720
would probably
be slow and painstaking.

50
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:22,393
You give off bad vibes, Shocker!

51
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:32,911
Spider-Man, we meet again!
Sooner than I expected!

52
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,082
I love reunions!

53
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,255
Here's one, Iceman!

54
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,064
Looks like I'll have to settle
with the wall-crawler

55
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,024
before I do anything else!

56
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,948
And I know just how I'm going to do it!

57
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,798
Leaving?
Was it something I said?

58
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:09,225
Puny insect! My vibro-shock
power lets me vibrate out of any trap!

59
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:14,150
The next reunion will be your last!

60
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,354
Over there!

61
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,654
Listen to me!

62
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,086
One of you for one of mine!

63
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:52,570
Shocker returns
with even more vibro-shock power!

64
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:59,375
Spider friends...

65
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,468
---Q0 for it!

66
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,765
Let's visit a maximum-security prison!

67
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,777
It's the Shocker! He's making a break!

68
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:34,394
Spider-Man put me in that hole
and now I'm gonna get even!

69
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,733
As you may recall,
he masterminded an escape of Americans

70
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,947
from a Vietnamese prison camp and has
maintained that the camp in which

71
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:44,077
he was held was not
the only one in Vietnam.

72
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,166
Though he has never been able
to offer any proof of his allegations,

73
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:50,506
Braddock has been one of the most
outspoken proponents of the theory

74
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:54,095
that American prisoners are
still being held in Vietnam today.

75
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,598
Braddock has, however,
refused all recent offers

76
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,771
to speak to servicemen 's organizations
on the subject of MIAs

77
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,275
and has completely withdrawn
from any public discussion

78
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,070
of the MIA controversy.

79
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:06,951
The American delegation had hoped
that Braddock's presence at the talks

80
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:09,455
would increase their ability
to negotiate.

81
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,839
This is Braddock.

82
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,056
I'll go.

83
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:23,146
The Vietnamese government
will never buy it.

84
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,651
The people in these photos
could be damn near anybody.

85
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,031
Including American MIAs.

86
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,789
Now, listen, even our own experts agree
that that's only a 50-50 chance.

87
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,418
You can imagine
what their people are gonna say.

88
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,505
We're gonna need something
a hell of a lot stronger than that

89
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,759
if we're gonna make
an impression on 'em.

90
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:45,016
Isn't that why Colonel Braddock
is along? As irrefutable evidence?

91
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,355
Some piece of irrefutable evidence.

92
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,525
Just look at the way
the son of a bitch is dressed.

93
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,904
Who am I trying to impress, Senator?

94
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,271
Senator Porter, I am General Tran.

95
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,399
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.

96
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,111
It's a pleasure, General.

97
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,284
I'd like to introduce you to
Ann Fitzgerald, State Department.

98
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,286
- Miss Fitzgerald, welcome.
- Thank you.

99
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:45,915
Colonel James Braddock.

100
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:50,631
Ah, Colonel Braddock,
I've heard much about you.

101
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,344
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.

102
00:15:58,436 --> 00:15:59,979
Colonel!

103
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,165
Excuse me.

104
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,337
You're a goddamn embarrassment,
Braddock.

105
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,883
That's why I'm here, Senator.

106
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:22,311
Something I've been wondering.
What made you change your mind?

107
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,774
I mean, we must've asked you 20 times.

108
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:26,527
I've got my reasons.

109
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,544
What's wrong?

110
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,883
Nothing's wrong.

111
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,543
So nice to have you with us.

112
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,924
Senator Porter, we all know that
Colonel Braddock was brought here

113
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:19,222
only in an attempt
to embarrass my government.

114
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,726
That's not true, General.

115
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,354
But I believe that once
the real reason

116
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:26,861
for his extended imprisonment
is revealed,

117
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:29,616
the world will take
quite a different view of him.

118
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,621
Miss Fitzgerald.

119
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,923
Colonel Braddock...

120
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,739
- General!
- Can we get through here?

121
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,576
Excuse me, General, sir...

122
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,231
These people were eyewitnesses
to some of the war crimes

123
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:40,281
committed by Colonel Braddock
against the people of Vietnam.

124
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,059
Innocent women, children
and old men were his victims.

125
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:59,323
You have their sworn statements
in front of you.

126
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,232
What did he say?

127
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,863
He said he understands and it's OK.

128
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,584
Colonel Braddock...
is it not true that during the war

129
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:21,592
there was a price on your head
of 5,000 American dollars?

130
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:26,557
It was more like $20,000.

131
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,186
What?

132
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,442
Why don't you tell us
why there was a price on my head?

133
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,861
For your war crimes, of course.

134
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:39,915
For killing assholes like you.

135
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,876
Colonel!

136
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,472
The atrocities,
as documented in front of you,

137
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:51,936
were the real reasons
why Colonel Braddock was held here!

138
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:56,360
He was not a prisoner of war,
but a common criminal!

139
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:23,032
Been

140
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:28,875
Thanks.

141
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:40,269
I see you've come up in the world.

142
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:46,740
You got out
of this country once, Colonel.

143
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,040
You might not be so lucky this time.

144
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:02,935
Tran is up in arms about
your behavior this afternoon.

145
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:08,735
Porter called Washington
trying to get you recalled.

146
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:13,160
And the President is outraged...
publicly.

147
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:17,543
Ah, Miss Fitzgerald,
you look lovely tonight.

148
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:21,174
Uh, Colonel Braddock, there is a
question I've been wanting to ask you.

149
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:24,681
Is it true that you let
ten of your men die in prison

150
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:29,397
all because you alone refused
to admit your war crimes?

151
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,539
You are the most undiplomatic man
I have ever met.

152
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm not running for office. Besides,
you don't know anything about me.

153
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,304
Oh. Well, let's see.

154
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,768
James Thomas Braddock, 38 years old.

155
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:53,689
Colonel in the Army Special Forces.
Retired.

156
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,982
Prisoner of war for eight months.

157
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:58,323
Missing in action for seven years,
escaping last year.

158
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,826
And you are now in Saigon
at the request of the President

159
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,707
to see if there are
any more Braddocks in Vietnam.

160
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:10,301
Like I said,
you don't know anything about me.

161
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,230
How about a nightcap?

162
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:24,201
Yeah, sure.
See you in a few minutes, huh?

163
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:19,046
The champagne's getting warm.

164
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,715
Oh, yeah.

165
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,894
Been quite a day.

166
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:31,108
Yeah. It should be quite a night, too.

167
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:35,199
Now, look, Braddock, just because...

168
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,748
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- What does it look like?

169
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,347
Would you mind?
I'm a little on the shy side.

170
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,979
I don't believe this.

171
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:56,361
Look, Braddock, I invited you up here
for a nightcap, not...

172
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:01,579
Jim!

173
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:09,759
What the hell is this?

174
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:14,225
I'm gonna take a look around Saigon.
See how it's changed since the war.

175
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:18,107
We are not supposed to leave
the hotel without an escort.

176
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,485
Jim, do you hear me?

177
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:22,532
I won't be gone long.

178
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:25,036
I'm supposed to be keeping you
out of trouble.

179
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:31,504
Shit.

180
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:43,318
Braddock, don't.

181
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,958
How are you gonna
get out of here, anyway?

182
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,217
FIY-

183
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,601
Bastard.

184
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,489
Keep your eyes shut...

185
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,367
...and listen very carefully.

186
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,462
The answer you give me...

187
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:59,931
...will decide whether you live or die.

188
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,186
And I'll know if you're lying

189
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:10,408
Now, where are the American MIAs?

190
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:12,787
I don't know.

191
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:14,207
Don't do it!

192
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,129
There is a camp.

193
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,799
- Delta region.
- Where?

194
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,433
Dong Ha. Dong Ha.

195
00:33:25,143 --> 00:33:27,730
Eight kilometers from the coast.

196
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:38,499
No, don't! Don't! Spare me!

197
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,045
I gave you the information. I gave it.

198
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,340
That's all I know. Don't...

199
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,665
If you move...

200
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,715
...I'll kill you.

201
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:41,507
I suppose he's been here
with you all night?

202
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,054
That's right.

203
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:48,185
How very convenient.

204
00:40:49,772 --> 00:40:51,441
Yes, isn't it?

205
00:40:51,608 --> 00:40:53,528
You...

206
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:55,865
You leave tomorrow...

207
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:58,495
...or you'll not leave at all.

208
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:18,403
I wish you didn't have to go.

209
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:21,285
Nothing I can do here.

210
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,624
Jim, why Bangkok?

211
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:27,921
I have to look up a friend.

212
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:36,770
An old army buddy.

213
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:49,960
Be careful.

214
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:16,045
Flight 320 from Ho Chi
Minh City, arriving at Gate Six.

215
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:28,275
Flight 210 to Singapore
now boarding at Gate Three.

216
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:08,074
Do you need a nice girl, sir?
It's ten dollars.

217
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:10,369
It's awfully cheap.

218
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:01,125
- Buy me a drink, handsome?
- Not tonight.

219
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,257
Do you speak English?

220
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:07,971
You bet.

221
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,852
- I'm looking for a friend.
- Isn't everybody?

222
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:22,620
He must be a good friend.

223
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:26,001
His name's Tucker. Jack Tucker.

224
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:40,193
I think... maybe I have heard of him.

225
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:44,450
- Where can I find him?
- What do you want him for?

226
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,356
Wrong answer.

227
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:53,615
He's probably at Madame Pearl's
whorehouse down the road.

228
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:57,119
Thanks.

229
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,793
Come back soon.

230
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,077
Taxi! Taxi!

231
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:34,269
Patpong Road.

232
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,198
Sam Song Hotel.

233
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,615
J' She sits alone waiting for suggestions

234
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:57,080
J' He's so nervous,
avoiding all the questions

235
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:59,668
J' His lips are dry...

236
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,881
- Where's Madame Pearl?
- She's over there.

237
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:08,014
J' If you want my body
and you think I'm sexy

238
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:11,229
J' Come on, honey, let it show

239
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:19,159
I'm looking for Jack Tucker.
Is he around?

240
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:21,121
He'll be here... in a moment.

241
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,967
Thanks.

242
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:37,189
How's it going, Tuck?

243
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:39,111
Braddock.

244
00:48:39,278 --> 00:48:42,868
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I wanna rent your boat.

245
00:48:44,036 --> 00:48:46,289
Oh, shit. We'd better talk later.

246
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:52,008
It's important. How much?

247
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:53,887
Five grand.

248
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,684
- Four grand!
- I didn't hear ya!

249
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,855
Two!

250
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:04,028
- Did you say one thousand?
- No.

251
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,289
Yeah, a thousand bucks.

252
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:12,210
That's what I thought you said.
Come on.

253
00:49:12,378 --> 00:49:15,967
What the hell do you need
my boat for, anyway?

254
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:19,556
We're going back to Nam
to rescue some MIAs.

255
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:24,147
Oh, shit, Braddock. You're crazy.

256
00:49:24,315 --> 00:49:26,819
You said "we."
You said "we're going back."

257
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:29,824
You owe me, Tuck. I need your help.

258
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:34,832
Yeah, I owe you.

259
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,086
More than once.

260
00:49:40,884 --> 00:49:44,015
All right, you bastard.
I'll take you in.

261
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:46,603
But I'm not going ashore.

262
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,896
OK?

263
00:49:49,191 --> 00:49:50,443
OK.

264
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,036
Getting in is no problem.

265
00:50:20,204 --> 00:50:23,542
I've been smuggling cigarettes
and booze for years.

266
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,842
My new Southern Belle's one of the
fastest boats in the water around here.

267
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,722
There she is.

268
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,818
What the hell is that?

269
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:43,952
Like my daddy always said,
don't believe everything you see.

270
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:57,810
Discourages pirates.

271
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:04,280
I'll show you something back here.

272
00:51:13,212 --> 00:51:17,344
They're Detroit diesels.
Turbocharged, 650 horsepower.

273
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:20,267
We can hit 21 knots if we have to.

274
00:51:31,953 --> 00:51:37,462
M-16s, grenades, C-4, LAW.

275
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,716
You're playing for keeps.

276
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:43,472
What the hell do you need
an assault raft for?

277
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,895
The camp's in the delta.
A raft is the easiest way in.

278
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,150
How come you never mention
getting out?

279
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,325
If we can hit the camp without raising
an alarm, we'll go back the way we came.

280
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:57,747
- That's nice. And if not?
- We'll think of something.

281
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:01,338
Great. Look, you wanna do me a favor?

282
00:52:01,505 --> 00:52:03,173
Next time I ask you something
about the mission,

283
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:06,011
you don't tell me nothing, OK?
I'd rather not know.

284
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:08,015
- There is something else.
- What?

285
00:52:08,183 --> 00:52:10,603
We could use a long-range chopper
as a backup.

286
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,148
Now how in hell are we supposed
to manage that?

287
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:15,947
We'll think of something.

288
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,871
Gentlemen,
I can help you with everything,

289
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,376
even the M-16s, but not the raft.

290
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:25,504
Bullshit, Carlos.
We both know you got one.

291
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:30,012
Got one? Sure, I got one.
I got the only one in all Thailand.

292
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:32,016
But have you got the money?
That's the question.

293
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:34,687
Let's see the sucker first,
then we'll talk money.

294
00:52:35,772 --> 00:52:37,817
There she is. Yang!

295
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,078
Quite a unique weapon, eh?

296
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:50,548
She can run 60 miles an hour,
and, with her mufflers on,

297
00:52:50,716 --> 00:52:52,843
no one can hear you coming.

298
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:56,391
Yeah, too bad a single bullet'll
put her out of commission.

299
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,270
Yang.

300
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:13,128
It's Kevlar.

301
00:53:13,296 --> 00:53:15,256
Very expensive.

302
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:18,638
Same material your bulletproof vests
are made out of.

303
00:53:18,806 --> 00:53:22,395
It will stop anything,
short of a grenade.

304
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:25,149
How much?

305
00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:29,281
Twenty thousand American dollars...
for the raft.

306
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:32,078
The rifles and ammunition...

307
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:33,998
...I throw in, free.

308
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:43,849
Five.

309
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:46,770
Don't be ridiculous.

310
00:53:46,938 --> 00:53:50,025
There is nothing like her
in all of Southeast Asia.

311
00:53:54,952 --> 00:53:57,415
- Seven.
- Seventeen!

312
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:09,059
Fifteen. No less.

313
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:19,869
Ten.

314
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,253
Deal.

315
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,553
So, if I get this helicopter of yours,

316
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,430
are you willing to pay?

317
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,934
I didn't figure it was free.

318
00:54:57,937 --> 00:55:03,488
- OK, then. What about the marking? US?
- It doesn't matter.

319
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:08,121
Just make sure I can count on the pilot.

320
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,042
Look around, my friend.

321
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:16,927
In this place, you can count on
people doing anything for money.

322
00:59:01,902 --> 00:59:04,407
Braddock! Hey, hop in!

323
00:59:04,573 --> 00:59:06,452
Come on, we're leaving early.

324
00:59:07,161 --> 00:59:08,747
Get dressed.

325
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,044
AW... Shit.

326
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:44,873
Mike, cast off!

327
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,224
You shouldn't have hurt
those people in Bangkok.

328
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:22,481
Fortunes of war.

329
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:24,234
Yeah.

330
01:05:30,912 --> 01:05:32,957
Fortunes of war.

331
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,844
Well, there she is... Vietnam.

332
01:05:50,892 --> 01:05:52,895
Pearl of the Orient.

333
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:10,322
If I'm not back in 12 hours,
get the hell outta here.

334
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:13,535
You're crazy, Braddock.

335
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,125
Maybe.

336
01:06:17,293 --> 01:06:21,049
What happens if you have to fight
and navigate at the same time?

337
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:23,887
I'll figure something out.

338
01:06:25,556 --> 01:06:28,895
You already have. You son of a bitch!

339
01:06:29,063 --> 01:06:32,361
Goddammit! You knew there was no way
in hell I'd let you go in there alone

340
01:06:32,528 --> 01:06:34,446
once we got here, didn't you?

341
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,743
Let's get one thing straight!

342
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:40,374
I'm only here to operate the damn raft!
That's it. Period!

343
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,504
I'm not getting outta
the goddamn thing for any reason!

344
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:45,757
Give us 14 hours!

345
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:49,850
If I don't make it back,
the Belle 's yours.

346
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:29,835
Come on, Tuck.

347
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:39,852
No. You promised me
I wouldn't have to get off the raft.

348
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:46,323
What do we need that for, anyway?
We're coming back on the raft.

349
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:51,373
If we're lucky. If not, I don't think
our guys are gonna be in much condition

350
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,501
to swim out to the boat.

351
01:08:41,294 --> 01:08:42,295
Tuck.

352
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,817
Aah!

353
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:24,242
Sorry. Won't happen again.

354
01:11:26,664 --> 01:11:30,546
- Do we run or fight?
- We don't have a choice now.

355
01:12:21,844 --> 01:12:24,890
The camp is about one klick
north of here.

356
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:27,311
I'll go the rest of the way on foot.

357
01:12:29,398 --> 01:12:30,524
Thanks for coming this far.

358
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:33,697
- Did I have a choice?
- Yeah, you did.

359
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:38,830
Watch your ass!

360
01:22:38,308 --> 01:22:41,439
Sergeant Dinh, Black Panther Rangers.

361
01:22:44,694 --> 01:22:48,659
- You are after the Americans?
- Yeah. Where are they?

362
01:22:48,827 --> 01:22:52,708
They moved less than three hours ago,
somewhere further inland.

363
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:54,461
Do you know which road they took?

364
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:58,051
There is only one road
that connects with Highway One.

365
01:22:58,218 --> 01:23:00,345
It follows the river all the way.

366
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:03,560
- You are going after them?
- Yeah.

367
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,415
Thank you. Thank you.

368
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:47,303
Tuck!

369
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:50,975
- Tuck!
- Braddock?

370
01:23:54,982 --> 01:23:57,570
- Where's our people?
- They've been moved.

371
01:23:57,738 --> 01:23:59,991
- Shit!
- Let's go!

372
01:25:14,872 --> 01:25:15,916
There it is!

373
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:29,083
Aah!

374
01:27:50,225 --> 01:27:51,227
Braddock?

375
01:27:52,062 --> 01:27:53,480
Is it safe?

376
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:26,163
Holy Christ.

377
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:42,817
You guys are going home.

378
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:49,244
We're going home?

379
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,498
Damn right!

380
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:52,999
Give me your hand.

381
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,588
We're going home!

382
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,240
Come on!

383
01:29:02,909 --> 01:29:04,370
Get to the Jeep!

384
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,796
Get in! Come on!

385
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,133
Get in!

386
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:13,719
OK, Braddock!

387
01:29:57,671 --> 01:30:00,300
- How far to the coast?
- About six klicks.

388
01:30:01,302 --> 01:30:03,139
Pray the boat's still there.

389
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:39,576
Take 'em to the river! I'll catch up.

390
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,079
Out you 90-

391
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:43,334
Keep it goin'!

392
01:30:45,338 --> 01:30:47,090
Keep it goin'!

393
01:31:34,423 --> 01:31:36,091
Two klicks to the coast.
Can you make it?

394
01:31:36,259 --> 01:31:37,261
We'll make it.

395
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:13,676
Come on!

396
01:32:13,844 --> 01:32:15,262
Come on! Come on!

397
01:32:17,016 --> 01:32:19,311
Come on! Move it!

398
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:22,316
Come on! The boat!

399
01:32:22,484 --> 01:32:23,861
Keep moving there! Keep goin' now!

400
01:32:28,661 --> 01:32:30,580
Keep moving! Come on!

401
01:32:56,626 --> 01:32:57,628
Come on!

402
01:33:19,584 --> 01:33:21,044
Come on!

403
01:33:27,264 --> 01:33:29,182
Patrol boat!

404
01:33:47,214 --> 01:33:49,885
Get back! Go back to the shore!

405
01:34:08,669 --> 01:34:10,588
I'll see you in hell!

406
01:34:11,757 --> 01:34:12,841
Tuck!

407
01:34:19,437 --> 01:34:20,606
Take it down!

408
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:50,491
Aah!

409
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:24,007
Hurry up!

410
01:36:45,275 --> 01:36:48,447
- Where to?
- Saigon.

411
01:36:48,613 --> 01:36:50,366
Oh, shit!

412
01:36:50,533 --> 01:36:52,495
If I knew it would be like this,

413
01:36:52,662 --> 01:36:55,040
I wouldn't rent you the helicopter
for a million bucks!

414
01:37:05,476 --> 01:37:09,650
My government is extremely gratified

415
01:37:09,817 --> 01:37:14,992
to be able to put this issue to rest,
once and for all.

416
01:37:55,285 --> 01:37:57,080
In conclusion, then...

417
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,868
...we categorically deny...

418
01:38:05,585 --> 01:38:10,593
...that there are any living MIAs
in the People's Republic of Vietnam.
