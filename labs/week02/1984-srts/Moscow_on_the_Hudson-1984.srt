1
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:30,041
Moscow on the Hudson

2
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:21,360
Excuse me, please, sir.
Does this bus go to the Lincoln Center?

3
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,044
-Lincoln Center?
-Yes.

4
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,724
You're on the wrong bus.
It's okay, don't worry.

5
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,805
All you have to do is go to 57th Street,
change buses and get on the No. 30 bus.

6
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:36,044
Don't worry.
I'll let you know when it's time.

7
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,127
Then you go and get a free transfer
from the driver.

8
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,926
-Thank you.
-No problem.

9
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,162
It's tough getting around here at first.

10
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,047
I WANT TO GO TO ISRAEL

11
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,443
Toilet paper?

12
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,243
Shoes, I think.

13
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,406
They must be Czech or Polish
for such a line.

14
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,725
I don't know.

15
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,647
Size?

16
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:29,718
Forty-five.

17
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,282
No forty-fives left.

18
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,599
Forty-four or forty-six will do.

19
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,802
We only have thirty-eights.

20
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:36,799
I'll take three pairs.

21
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,481
Only two to a customer.

22
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:39,888
Two thirty-eights, then.

23
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:17,399
If you want to go on the New York tour
you'd better behave.

24
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,484
You are late. We're getting ready.
Don't you want to go to New York?

25
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,480
I couldn't help it.

26
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,644
Czech?

27
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,282
The queue was endless.

28
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,043
I wear a forty-two.

29
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,608
These are thirty-eight.

30
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,008
How much?

31
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,644
Forty roubles.

32
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:45,798
Forty?

33
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,963
I know you only paid twenty.

34
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,798
All right. I give them to you as a gift.

35
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,599
Why forty, you only paid twenty?

36
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,599
Did you lick his ass good? Was it tasty?

37
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:46,561
When you arrive in New York,
you must understand...

38
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,800
...that you are representatives
of the nation of the revolution.

39
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,677
Many people will take perverse pleasure in
tempting you with American decadence.

40
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,768
KGB pig!

41
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,200
They see you as targets for seduction.

42
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:05,526
Prostitutes will try to tempt you
with their unhealthy immorality.

43
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,120
And stay away from places
like the subway.

44
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,200
Times Square.

45
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,845
Greenwich Village.

46
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:23,045
Rockefeller Center.

47
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,365
I'm an artist, and an artist without freedom
is a bird without wings.

48
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,167
Watch where you drive, artist.

49
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,439
I know the same nausea is grabbing at you.

50
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,478
I am content.

51
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:49,518
Bullshit! You are a gear in a bad machine.
Don't you have a soul?

52
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,921
My soul is standing in line
at the food store.

53
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,842
Gasoline!

54
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,725
Fill them up.

55
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,648
See how corrupt we are.

56
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,405
America is not corrupt? France?

57
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:40,207
My soul is dying.

58
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,961
My stomach is growling.

59
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,527
Let's practice our English.

60
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,403
Let us practice. You start.

61
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,721
Hello, mister.

62
00:07:55,609 --> 00:08:00,729
-Hello, mister. May I buy lamb chop?
-Sure thing, mister.

63
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:07,199
-Do you read Ernest Hemingway?
-Every fucking day.

64
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,124
Kiss me, beautiful. Beautiful? Beautiful.

65
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,242
I love you.

66
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,686
Yes, my dear clown?

67
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,478
When we come to New York,
I'm going to defect.

68
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:28,518
-Why do you do this to me?
-I had to tell you that.

69
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,723
You know I am obliged
to report you to the authorities.

70
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,006
I want a Mercedes-Benz.
I want to piss in the wind.

71
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,005
I want to see Rio de Janeiro!

72
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,997
I want to see London! I want to see Paris!

73
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:46,798
Stop it.

74
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,163
Taxi, take me out of here!

75
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,886
I could be KGB.

76
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,400
Then my ass is already frozen.

77
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,320
Please. Be careful, my friend.

78
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,562
I hate my life.

79
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,287
Tonight at 9:00, as usual?

80
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,442
Yes, see you.

81
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,728
Toilet paper?

82
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:15,041
Toilet paper or chickens, I'm not sure.

83
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,482
Toilet paper?

84
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,163
Top quality.

85
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,517
Thank you.

86
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,324
Leonid? You're back.

87
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,321
How is your music?

88
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,359
I still play for tigers and bears. And you?
Are you teaching?

89
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,247
No. I have a newjob. I pave streets.

90
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,639
I protested Afghanistan--

91
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,878
I know. I heard.

92
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,047
They said I was crazy,
so they sent me to a mental hospital.

93
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,921
Were you crazy?

94
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,445
If I was really crazy, how would I know it?

95
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,562
We shall talk, Leonid.

96
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,004
Don't ever go crazy if you can help it.

97
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:29,561
You! Don't try to break in the line!

98
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,445
You found it! Congratulations, Vladimir.

99
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:21,764
Why does everyone in this family
make such a fuss over toilet paper?

100
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,843
Eating and going to the bathroom
are the secrets of happiness.

101
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,440
I've made some borsch, Vladimir.

102
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,848
I can't. I'm meeting Svetlana.

103
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,246
If you married her,
you'd get an apartment of your own.

104
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not ready for another marriage.

105
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,768
I like Svetlana.

106
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,966
Is she the one with the big tits ?

107
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:51,324
You should have been a poet, Grandfather.

108
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,163
Oh, I almost forgot! Pickled mushrooms.

109
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,806
It would make me happy
to be a grandmother, Vladimir.

110
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,039
Look at those black people. What a mess.

111
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,168
Beautiful people and great musicians.

112
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,967
Do you know Duke Ellington?

113
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:42,401
There's a great tune: Take the 'A' Train.

114
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,007
Now we'll be arrested for sure.

115
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:28,729
Before we marry, you should join the Party.
It would help us get a good apartment.

116
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,126
You know I'm not a joiner.

117
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,367
It's a bit humiliating,
always borrowing Anatoly's place.

118
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,281
That's what friends are for.

119
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:09,081
Get away, you snoop.

120
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,479
I am going to report you to the police.

121
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,528
-May I kiss your lamb chops, beautiful?
-Okay, mister.

122
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,282
I have something for you.

123
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,447
You certainly know
how to get to a girl's heart.

124
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,080
It's for your soft, rosy bottom,
not your heart.

125
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,642
Will you miss me in America?

126
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,401
Yes.

127
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,598
You know, I am jealous of you.

128
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,205
Why?

129
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,998
I wish I could see America.

130
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,121
Yes, I am lucky.

131
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,521
I'd like to see it with my own eyes...

132
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:29,126
...the decadence...

133
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,362
...the crime, the poverty....

134
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,800
The inflation.

135
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:51,202
You know what I would like from America?

136
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,326
Blue jeans, my darling.

137
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,607
Jordache.

138
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,608
Sergio Valente....

139
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,879
And anything from Calvin Klein.

140
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,360
Too much vodka.

141
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,686
Hush, my Don Juan, hush.

142
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,883
There are whores in Gorky Park
who have carved my name on trees.

143
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,678
Horseshit! You smiling bastards.

144
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,280
Good morning, Grandfather.

145
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,848
Good morning, Vladimir.

146
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,407
Next they'll tell us
the crops are good this year.

147
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,842
The agricultural news
is excellent this morning.

148
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:26,964
Lies, tell us more lies.

149
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,085
You shouldn't talk that way, Father.

150
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:31,125
You have no respect for position.

151
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,521
Let them come and arrest me.

152
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,529
Let them take me away like Leonid,
the neighbour's boy.

153
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:49,203
Leonid is stupid.
He sympathised with the Afghans.

154
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,840
Trotsky was right.

155
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,888
They have dumped shit on the revolution
from head to toe.

156
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,643
You'll land us all in prison.

157
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:02,364
They're not looking for you.
You're not a dissident.

158
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,124
You're not Sakharov or Shcharansky.

159
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:11,285
Our leaders are only good for parades.

160
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,168
And they don't have any balls.

161
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,845
I've never seen the balls of our leaders.

162
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,244
Oh, you'll see them. In the next revolution.

163
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,444
They'll hang the balls of our leaders
on the walls of a museum.

164
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,040
Good morning, Vladimir lvanoff.

165
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,403
I have done nothing.

166
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,127
Perhaps.

167
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,966
Nicholai lvanoff is your grandfather?

168
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:00,925
Of course.

169
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:05,201
Your neighbours say he yells
anti-Soviet slogans out of the window.

170
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,278
He's an old man.

171
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,964
Makes rude gestures at people
doing their socialist duties.

172
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:12,722
He is a comedian. He likes mischief.

173
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,803
Perhaps he is senile
and should go to a mental hospital.

174
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,637
He is a war hero.

175
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,523
Please, I will talk to him.

176
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,483
It might be wiser for you
not to use the apartment...

177
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:30,686
...of your friend, Anatoly Cherkasov,
for your sexual encounters.

178
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,997
I have done nothing wrong.

179
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,284
Good. It might go well
for your grandfather...

180
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,246
...if you kept your eyes on Cherkasov.

181
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:37,843
He is only a clown.

182
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,480
Yes, but perhaps he wants
to clown his way out of the Soviet Union.

183
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,440
Goodbye, Vladimir lvanoff.

184
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:57,044
Also, those fucking shoes are killing me.

185
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:42,759
Vladimir, one day I'll perform on Broadway.

186
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,441
It will be a big sign:

187
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:47,687
"Anatoly Cherkasov
and Barbara Streisand."

188
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,846
America is magnificent.

189
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:54,527
They say it is customary to take towels.

190
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:00,525
Look, a giant prophylactic. It fits me.

191
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:03,840
Please speak English.
You promised. I must practice.

192
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,598
-Okay, mister.
-Thank you very much.

193
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:15,881
This television is a piece of crap,
just like in Russia.

194
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,607
My father will love this.

195
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,279
It must be smooth like velvet.

196
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,886
Stop thinking of your ass
and think about your soul.

197
00:25:28,969 --> 00:25:33,360
Don't play game with me, okay, pal?

198
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:38,848
Do you want to know why I am lucky
to share room with you, polodurak?

199
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:44,767
Because they want me to spy on you.

200
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,042
I shit on them!

201
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:02,600
Maybe this decadence attempt to lure us.

202
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,087
Then they have succeeded.

203
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:11,009
-What a country.
-What a country.

204
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,558
I really do want to go to Leningrad.

205
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,088
Tell me, do you like Barbara Streisand?

206
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:51,765
Yeah, she's wonderful.

207
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,161
Waiter, I'll have a Black Russian.

208
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:17,918
-Is something the matter?
-No, I am happy here be.

209
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:22,799
-Your English is excellent.
-So is your.

210
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:28,328
Veronica Cohen.
I teach Marxism at Columbia University.

211
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:31,847
Vladimir lvanoff.
I am musician with circus.

212
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,243
Yes, I know.

213
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:38,885
You don't look like a Marxist.

214
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:43,326
I'm not. I'm a humanist.
What does a Marxist look like?

215
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:46,282
Usually has beard, moustache.

216
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,883
-The women, too?
-In Russia, especially women.

217
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:56,200
Excuse me. I am happy to talk to you,
but I must now to make toilet.

218
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,958
What about your president?

219
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,609
He was an actor before, just like us.

220
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,398
What about credibility with him?

221
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:16,526
I know what I will do.

222
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,319
Tomorrow, during the opening parade,
in my bicycle routine, I'll do it.

223
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:25,285
-I will defect.
-Good. They throw you right to bear.

224
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,767
Tomorrow is the day.

225
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,566
Think of your family.

226
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:45,440
Would you like to watch me
take a piss, comrades?

227
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:01,204
Soon we'll be back in Moscow.

228
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,082
Ladies and gentlemen, good day.

229
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:16,246
I hope it ain't as bad
as when we had them Chinese acrobats.

230
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:19,924
Them ltalians came one time
and stole half the store.

231
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,523
They weren't ltalians,
they were Romanians.

232
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:25,004
I thought they said they was from Rome.

233
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,847
See the game last night?

234
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,808
Yeah, Magic Johnson was the best guard
I ever saw.

235
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,046
What a pair of hands.

236
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,605
Buon giorno, Lucia, darling.
What a piece of lasagne.

237
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,557
You have only 30 minutes
to shop in Bloomingdale's.

238
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:53,045
Then we go to the airport.

239
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,007
My God!

240
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:54,484
What decadence!

241
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:19,168
Excuse me.

242
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,881
You must be Russian.

243
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:25,644
Yes, I am with the circus.

244
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:28,520
We heard you guys were coming today.

245
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,008
Let me tell you something.

246
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,246
I wish for peace among all nations.

247
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,324
I am looking for blue jeans.

248
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:41,122
We had a nuclear freeze demonstration
this year, and I marched.

249
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,048
"Make love, not war," we say.

250
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,164
Make love, for sure.

251
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,606
I look for blue jeans.

252
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,877
Blue jeans, right. Designer jeans?

253
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:58,444
Jordache, Calvin Klein?

254
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:05,800
You go straight back to menswear,
like where that pole is.

255
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,520
I am Russian, not Pole.

256
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,048
Yeah, I know.

257
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:15,965
Well, anyway, you go straight, okay?

258
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:18,248
Then you take a left.

259
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:20,405
You can't miss the Denim Den.

260
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:23,040
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

261
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:25,964
I hope you have a nice stay in New York.

262
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:28,438
I go back to Moscow today.

263
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,168
Well, goodbye.

264
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:07,681
I will do it here.

265
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:10,767
Everyone watches here.

266
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,646
I don't give a shit.

267
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:15,084
I swear, I'll do it.

268
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,683
Do it! Go. Do!

269
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,638
Leave me alone. Go, do it.

270
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:25,687
Three items to a dressing room.

271
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:28,078
Gentlemen, please button your flies.

272
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,047
What are you doing?
No women in the dressing room!

273
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,882
Women don't belong in the dressing room!

274
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:38,004
They don't stay in the dressing rooms!

275
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:41,287
They can't be here. What do you mean--

276
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,286
I don't understand.

277
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,002
You're in America, speak English.

278
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:49,559
Are you feeling well, Anatoly?

279
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,605
You are pale and sweating.

280
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,200
It's nothing. Just a slight cold.

281
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,679
You know, different climate.

282
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:07,882
Soon you will be back in Moscow,
where the air is always clear.

283
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:40,040
-I can't do it.
-Good.

284
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,925
I am a bird without wings.

285
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,206
I'm sorry, my friend.

286
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:14,448
What are you guys doing?

287
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:17,760
Only one customer to a cubicle.
This ain't Russia.

288
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:20,562
Excuse me, sir.

289
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,441
Fags everywhere.

290
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:31,079
-Your wife will love Forbidden Fruit.
-Thank you.

291
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:35,601
Time to go.
Put Cherkasov and the others on the bus.

292
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:42,007
I would like to see some Forbidden Fruit.

293
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,722
Great. All right, I'll see you tonight.

294
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,521
Talk to you later.

295
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:53,926
Fabulous choice, sir.

296
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:16,360
Are you all right, sir?

297
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:19,317
Excuse me, sir. Are you all right?

298
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:21,758
Yes.

299
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,558
I suddenly feel dizzy.

300
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,440
Let's get you some H2O.

301
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:40,159
-I got a dizzy Russian on my hands.
-Take him home for supper.

302
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:44,083
-Is there a large gay community in Russia?
-How would I know? I'm not Russian.

303
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,807
The men's room is downstairs,
to the left of the escalator.

304
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:58,368
This ain't no health club.

305
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,800
-I defect.
-Say what?

306
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:11,401
Don't be grabbing on the uniform.
I have to supply the threads myself.

307
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:13,323
I defected.

308
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:16,640
You're not gonna do that here.
I told you where the men's room was.

309
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,481
Maybe I better take him.

310
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,008
I am Russian.

311
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:23,088
-I defect.
-You're about ready to get maced.

312
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,167
Oh, my God! Don't you get it?
He's defecting!

313
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:43,528
Code 2. We got a defection going on.
Style Boutique. Officer 14 on the scene.

314
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:44,962
Call the damn police!

315
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:34,683
You son of a bitch!

316
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,157
Please, help me.

317
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:52,279
-Are you the one defecting?
-Yes, I in danger, KGB. Please.

318
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,681
I think it's safe.

319
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:57,767
I know the Russian is behind the counter.
Give him my card.

320
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,603
My name is Orlando Ramirez.
I'm a lawyer. I specialise in immigration.

321
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,322
You've got a lawyer.

322
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:06,487
Thank you.

323
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,281
Are you enjoying yourself?

324
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:14,648
Excuse me.

325
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,441
Get up. Stay here. Stay right here.

326
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,241
This is Officer 14.

327
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:44,321
The defector is between Estee Lauder
and Pierre Cardin.

328
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:47,481
Officer, you must help me.
I want political asylum.

329
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:51,960
-I am a security officer, not a policeman.
-They will send me to a mental hospital.

330
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:55,047
-Who are these dudes?
-KGB. They will kill me.

331
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:57,689
-We are Soviet officials.
-Keep your hands off the man.

332
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:01,045
-Don't threaten me!
-I got Mace and handcuffs.

333
00:42:01,129 --> 00:42:05,327
If that don't dissuade you,
I got a 6-inch razor that will end this talk.

334
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:08,237
Stay put until the authorities get here.

335
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,757
Call the embassy!

336
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:12,283
I want to keep my comrade
from making a big mistake.

337
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,438
I told you to back off!

338
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:18,478
You're in my jurisdiction which runs from
Style Boutique to Personal Fragrances.

339
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,366
So keep your hands off the man!

340
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:24,121
-What's going on here, Mr. Simpson?
-I don't know.

341
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,882
-Don't blame me. I was on the floor.
-Who knows?

342
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,648
Some Russian is running around
talking about defection.

343
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:34,280
We don't like that at Bloomingdale's,
and it's up to you to keep order.

344
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:40,997
Everybody on the bus.
Everybody back on the bus.

345
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:47,043
In the name of the Soviet Union, I protest.
This Soviet citizen has been drugged.

346
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:50,166
-I am not drugged.
-He's being held against his will.

347
00:42:50,249 --> 00:42:54,003
Nobody is smoking no shit around here.
I've had it with you guys today.

348
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:55,283
Back off!

349
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:59,726
I'm Kaity Tong at Bloomingdale's
with a drama in American-Soviet relations.

350
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:03,404
Things are chaotic here,
but this is what we know so far:

351
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:07,403
Apparently, a member of the Russian
circus troupe, performing in New York...

352
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:10,686
...has decided to defect in,
of all places, Bloomie's.

353
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:15,766
Vladimir, I trusted you.
Now you do this to your family and to me.

354
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:17,646
You know what my life will be now?

355
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,406
Vladimir, have mercy.

356
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:27,202
You are a Russian.

357
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:31,124
Please, I will give you everything I own.

358
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:35,443
My sweet Volodnishka, please.

359
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:44,439
You will never see your parents
or your sister. Your grandfather...

360
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:47,406
...never.

361
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,163
I defect.

362
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:59,524
This is New York City.
A man can do whatever he wants.

363
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:04,485
The FBI has just arrived on the scene.
Gentlemen, a few questions.

364
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:06,287
How do you plan to handle this?

365
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,322
I'm Agent Ross
with the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

366
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:13,718
-Frank Williams, Justice.
-Mr. Ivanoff, let's talk.

367
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:17,245
Vladimir lvanoff is a defector.
And this guy, I don't know who he is.

368
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,967
KGB, whatever that is.

369
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:37,201
-What exactly do you protest?
-You cannot permit him to defect.

370
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:38,927
It seems he's already defected.

371
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,843
Mr. Ivanoff, can you tell us
why you're defecting?

372
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:46,247
-Freedom.
-Political freedom or artistic?

373
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:47,557
Freedom.

374
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:53,322
For now, consider yourself an applicant
for political asylum in the U.S.

375
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:55,718
That's a matter for lmmigration.

376
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:01,678
-You can still come home.
-I defect.

377
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,283
Let us pass.

378
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,358
Excuse us.

379
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:08,926
This means Siberia, for sure.

380
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:12,599
Do you have any family or friends
in the United States?

381
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,240
Sir, it's $147.50 for the robe...

382
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,445
...and $30 for the windbreaker.

383
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,078
Bitch.

384
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,520
Do you know anyone here, sir?

385
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:34,637
Only you. And this good black man
and shopping girl.

386
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:38,120
-Where is he going to stay?
-He can stay with me if he wants.

387
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:40,886
I can stay your home?

388
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,839
I'm Security Officer Witherspoon.

389
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,444
I understand how the brother feels.
I'm a refugee myself, from Alabama.

390
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,125
-Hold it!
-Wait a minute!

391
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,646
Tolya, I did it.

392
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:12,405
I'm free like a bird.

393
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:41,041
What are you saying?

394
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,206
I say goodbye to my saxophone.

395
00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:49,684
Say what?

396
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:54,246
Mr. Ivanoff, did I hear you say goodbye
to your saxophone?

397
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:59,762
He left his saxophone on the bus, I think.

398
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:04,327
Also, you waved goodbye to your friends.
You are very sad, obviously.

399
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:06,240
No, I am happy.

400
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:08,724
It is so nice to be here.

401
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,561
Yeah, he's going to stay here.

402
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:14,005
Thank you. This is Kaity Tong.

403
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:30,568
I think he knows you are a foreigner.
He's jiving on you.

404
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:33,846
You got to learn to look mean.
You understand what I'm saying?

405
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:35,363
Mean.

406
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:38,279
Is that your mean look?

407
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,646
Look crazy. Like this.

408
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:45,878
Crazy.

409
00:47:52,649 --> 00:47:54,367
Crazy motherfucker.

410
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,525
Many different people here,
but not many white people.

411
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:13,727
This is what is known as a ghetto,
with a capital "G."

412
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:20,679
I like it. It is nice.
And the music, it's so free.

413
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,847
-Must be pretty bad in Russia.
-It's not human.

414
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:28,604
-But there are many beautiful people.
-Sounds like Alabama.

415
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:30,646
I read about slavery.

416
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:34,724
-With slavery, the work was steady.
-Sounds like Russia.

417
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:38,568
I make joke.

418
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:43,558
I feel to make joke
in other language is good.

419
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:51,202
...a member of the Russian circus troupe,
performing in New York, has decided...

420
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:53,405
...to defect in, of all places, Bloomie's.

421
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:58,879
-Get in here. You're on TV.
-You look handsome.

422
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:06,768
You look good, Vladimir.
Now you go running out the store.

423
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:08,840
We can see it again on the 1 1 :00 news.

424
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:10,840
Mama, this is Vladimir.

425
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:14,838
This is my stepfather, Fletcher.
My bucket-head sister, Leanne.

426
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,769
My grandfather.
You have to watch out for his ass.

427
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:22,207
-I never met a Russian. They all white?
-You defected.

428
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:26,848
Yes. You are kind
to share your home with me.

429
00:49:27,169 --> 00:49:30,764
Hope you didn't come for a job.
I haven't had one for eight years.

430
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:32,168
Welcome to the U.S.A.

431
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:38,205
Honey, you don't look so well.
Let's sit him down. You look peaky.

432
00:49:39,169 --> 00:49:42,639
You can just lay down right here.
Lionel, get his feet up, honey.

433
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:49,640
Lionel, man in store give me card.

434
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:56,078
"Orlando Ramirez." Sounds like
a Cuban ambulance chaser to me.

435
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:58,484
Get his fucking feet off my couch.

436
00:49:58,569 --> 00:49:59,843
Hush, Grandpa!

437
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,327
Good night, my American family.

438
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,321
I'm going to help you with everything.
Everything. Always.

439
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:25,084
It is very important to know
that you have a friend in Orlando Ramirez.

440
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:28,089
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

441
00:50:28,169 --> 00:50:31,445
You have to pay me.
That's the way capitalism works.

442
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,281
One hand helps the other.

443
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,839
I have $120 and one pair of blue jeans.

444
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:40,679
My fee for helping you
with immigration matters is cut and dry.

445
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:43,925
-May I call you Vladimir?
-Of course.

446
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,682
Orlando. That is a musical name.

447
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:50,604
My father was called Orlando.

448
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,728
He rolled the finest cigars in Havana.

449
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,318
Orlando "el Rey," they called him.

450
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:58,247
Orlando "the King."

451
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:01,563
Then Castro came along
and my father was on his ass.

452
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,800
Castro is a great man.

453
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:09,048
He's a bullshit artist who has been taken in
by Russian bullshit artists.

454
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:11,161
I'm not political.

455
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,927
-We had to get our asses out of Cuba.
-Defect?

456
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:16,158
No.

457
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:19,847
We took a life raft to Miami Beach, Florida.

458
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:22,523
The only way to fly, let me tell you.

459
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:25,842
It was almost 20 years ago.

460
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:40,362
-I told you about eggs and onions.
-I want to go shopping later.

461
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,279
-I want to get something for the kids.
-We don't have any kids.

462
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:47,566
Jack's kids.
He wants some scuba gear for the kids.

463
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:52,000
Some vacation. They said this place
was sunny. This isn't sun.

464
00:51:52,249 --> 00:51:56,003
You get better sun on our roof.
We're not wasting $10 on that lotion.

465
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:58,803
There's the boy.

466
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:02,199
Ask him for a couple of rum and Cokes
and beach towels.

467
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:06,445
Give me two Cuba Libres
and a couple of beach towels.

468
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:10,159
Here, come on, make it snappy.

469
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,604
Talking to them is like talking to a wall.

470
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:17,201
Well, here I am.

471
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:21,797
It hasn't been easy,
but you can do anything in this country.

472
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,677
Where are you going?

473
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:27,158
You passed Chambers Street twice already.

474
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:32,565
Sorry, sir. I think Chambers Street here,
but Chambers is over there.

475
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:36,365
Drive a cab in Korea if you don't know
one street from the other.

476
00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:43,487
Mr. Ivanoff, this is only stage one.

477
00:52:43,729 --> 00:52:47,324
You will be interviewed again
to determine your status.

478
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:49,365
Until then, you'll need a work permit.

479
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,168
Make sure the man understands
all of this, Mr. R.

480
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:55,127
I understand. When for next interview?

481
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:58,679
In one month, we'll give an advisory
opinion if asylum should be granted.

482
00:52:58,769 --> 00:52:59,997
Don't worry, you'll get it.

483
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:04,162
-In a year, you can petition for citizenship.
-I must wait for one year?

484
00:53:04,249 --> 00:53:06,922
Do you know how many people
want to get in this country?

485
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:10,206
Vietnamese, Korean, Salvadorians.

486
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:14,038
Those lranians, Mexicans, Bolivians,
Greeks, Turks.

487
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:15,881
Have mercy. So many people.

488
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:19,041
I have mercy,
but I can't carry the work home.

489
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:23,560
I'm like a TV set.
Turn me on at 8:00, turn me off at 4:00.

490
00:53:23,649 --> 00:53:26,482
I have been waiting two hours.
Who is your boss?

491
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:29,720
His name is Ronald Reagan!
Now sit the fuck down, Mr. Baktar!

492
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:35,438
Orlando, out!

493
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:39,001
Mr. Baktar,
your impatience is wearing me down.

494
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:42,001
I've been here two days
waiting to see the lmmigration Office.

495
00:54:38,249 --> 00:54:39,887
You guys going to dance?

496
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:41,687
No, I rest now.

497
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:47,364
He is good boy, Lionel.

498
00:54:47,649 --> 00:54:48,843
So-so.

499
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:52,399
No, he's nice, but don't call him "boy."

500
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:53,598
Why not?

501
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:58,201
Black men don't like to be called "boy."
They take it as an insult.

502
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:05,400
-That was a brave thing you did yesterday.
-Thank you.

503
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,757
For the first time, I act from here,
not from here.

504
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:15,565
-You are a good girl?
-Yes, good girl. You're a good boy?

505
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:18,000
I would like to know you.

506
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:24,126
I'm ltalian. From ltaly. From the Abruzzi.

507
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:27,123
It's a little village called Casoli.

508
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:30,083
Everybody I meet is from somewhere else.

509
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,368
It's America.

510
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:37,445
-Would you like to dance?
-Okay.

511
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,683
Come on.

512
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:50,559
Why you came America?

513
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:56,565
When my father died six years ago,
he left us seven children.

514
00:55:57,489 --> 00:56:01,164
We were so poor.
There wasn't much opportunity for a girl.

515
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:03,444
Or for a boy, for that matter.

516
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,362
So, I guess I was the lucky one.

517
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:10,407
I have an Uncle Sal who lives here.

518
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:12,441
He has a funeral parlour.

519
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:17,526
-He sponsored me.
-You speak very well.

520
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:20,408
In a few months, I will become a citizen.

521
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,080
Then watch me take off.

522
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:24,724
Take off?

523
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:27,968
I mean, I want to work in media.

524
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:29,801
In TV. Television.

525
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,604
I love sportscasting. Or newscasting.

526
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:39,079
Remember yesterday, this girl Kaity Tong?

527
00:56:39,249 --> 00:56:42,764
At Bloomingdale's. You know, the girl?

528
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:46,121
I think she's great. She's fantastic.

529
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:00,603
-I am be followed.
-Where?

530
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,244
That man.

531
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:12,399
That's the FBl.

532
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:15,561
They watch you for a few weeks,
make sure you're not a spy.

533
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:21,041
Also to keep the KGB from kidnapping you,
for your own protection. Relax, amigo.

534
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:30,079
-Is that a new dance from Russia?
-Excuse me for my rudeness.

535
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:37,886
-Thank you for protection.
-That's what we're here for.

536
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:40,205
Have a good time.

537
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:53,359
All this week we've been working
on the stomach. Here's part three.

538
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:57,044
Time to work on the stomach again.
We'll begin with abdominal warm-ups.

539
00:57:57,129 --> 00:58:01,042
Remember how to do this one?
You inhale and keep it nice and firm.

540
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:03,160
First we do lower back-drops.

541
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:07,278
-Good morning, Vlad. How you doing?
-Good. I feel fine.

542
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:09,439
I wish to be useful.

543
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:11,806
How may I help you?

544
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,242
You can do the shopping.

545
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:16,207
I have an appointment
at the Human Resources Administration.

546
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:19,201
-The unemployment office.
-Lucia has something going for you.

547
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,245
She's got an ass on her.

548
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:24,282
I like, last night, musicians much.

549
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:26,366
Excellent saxophones.

550
00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:29,125
You ever hear of the "Bird"?

551
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:32,366
-The great Charlie Parker?
-He was a wailing ass.

552
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:33,768
That boy could blow.

553
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:38,879
Excuse me, Grandpa,
why you call Charlie Parker "boy"?

554
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,963
What should I call him? "Rhinoceros"?

555
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,727
-How's the coffee coming?
-We're out of coffee.

556
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:49,927
-We'd have coffee if you'd get off your butt.
-Don't talk to me like that.

557
00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:54,441
-I'll work when I can find something.
-You could've delivered telephone books.

558
00:58:54,529 --> 00:58:58,238
Bullshit! Deliver books!
I got a college education.

559
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:02,766
We know you got a college education.
You told us a million times!

560
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,968
You're just like your mother.
Just like your mother.

561
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:11,244
Leave my mother out of this.
She's more of a man than you'll ever be.

562
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:14,878
I go shopping. I must to pay. Please.

563
00:59:31,489 --> 00:59:32,683
Coffee?

564
00:59:33,129 --> 00:59:34,357
Aisle 2.

565
00:59:34,929 --> 00:59:38,638
-Coffee line, please?
-Aisle 2. No line, though.

566
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,399

Mr. Ivanoff, don't worry.

575
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,488
You're merely suffering
some hyperventilation.

576
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:25,286
Don't be alarmed. You are among friends.

577
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:29,446
You should have seen yours truly
when I first came from Bombay.

578
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,565
I was very nervous.

579
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:34,117
Look at these girls. They know, too.

580
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:36,967
I am feeling better.

581
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:43,200
-You're something of a celebrity.
-I'm his lawyer, Orlando Ramirez.

582
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:46,325
Everybody was worried about you.

583
01:00:46,649 --> 01:00:49,641
My wife thought you'd been kidnapped
by the KGB.

584
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,048
I'm sorry.

585
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:54,119
I have wonderful news for you.

586
01:00:54,729 --> 01:00:57,960
-I've made some calls to find you a job.
-I take it.

587
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:00,517
-Nothing fancy, my friend.
-I take it.

588
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:23,041
When you speak English,
does your mouth hurt?

589
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,803
My mouth is fine. My brain hurts.

590
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:29,281
When I speak English,
my lips and tongue hurt.

591
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:33,561
-I wish they would stop playing this music.
-I wish only to play music.

592
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:36,124
-You'll get your chance.
-So will you.

593
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:39,804
Do you know how difficult it is
to get a job in celestial mechanics...

594
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:41,322
...and astrophysics?

595
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:43,685
Boy, you speak English well.

596
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:46,727
In a couple of minutes,
we will take a break.

597
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:51,043
Maybe we pick up cheeseburger,
side of fries, and Coca-Cola.

Randolph to first.

preppy junk for?

631
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,365
FBl? No.

632
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:51,843
KGB?

633
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:54,758
No.

634
01:04:57,049 --> 01:04:58,198
G-A-Y.

635
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:03,522
Gay?

636
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:06,845
Oh, no. No.

637
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:13,567
Sorry. You have a nice face.
I thought we had a moment back there.

638
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:15,287
I hope it didn't upset you.

639
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:19,204
No. It's okay, mister.
Thank you. Good luck.

640
01:05:24,729 --> 01:05:28,438
"Dear Tolya: I have a new saxophone...

641
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:31,168
"...but I still don't have work as a musician.

642
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:34,320
"I have many otherjobs, though. "

643
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:37,118
Two Big Macs,
one Quarter Pounder with cheese...

644
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:41,999
...six pieces Chicken McNuggets,
two boxes Ronald McDonald cookies...

645
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:44,728
...one order McFries,
two chocolate milk shakes.

646
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:45,958
Is that to go?

647
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,881
No, I eat it here.

648
01:05:48,649 --> 01:05:50,367
Come back Mc-soon.

649
01:05:50,689 --> 01:05:52,998
"I am now driving a taxi part-time. "

650
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,684
Sunday I got a date with Lucia.

651
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:00,518
I knew it! I knew there was something
going on between you and her.

652
01:06:00,609 --> 01:06:03,726
No, nothing going on.
I'm still virgin in New York City.

653
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:07,886
There ain't no crime in sex.
You're too shy.

654
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,563
-She digs you, man. I know she does.
-You think so?

655
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:13,641
You're probably the only man
in New York without herpes.

656
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:16,727
"I have met some members
of Russian community.

657
01:06:18,169 --> 01:06:21,923
"Some of them are painters,
sculptors, writers, photographers.

658
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:25,206
"They all have made adjustments
to life in America.

659
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:30,199
"To tell you the truth, dear Tolya,
they still despair, and so do l.

660
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:40,001
"And, dear friend,
I wish you joy for all your days.

661
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:42,965
"Kiss the bears and the ponies.

662
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:46,958
"Perhaps, some day, I will see you again.
Volya. "

663
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:20,758
I like it.

664
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:24,561
It's very nice.

665
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:26,487
Not much furniture.

666
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:31,168
You bought the blender we had on sale.
What do you make with it?

667
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,758
Nothing. I don't blend anything.

668
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:38,406
You miss Russia, don't you?

669
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:40,923
Sure. Sometime. You want some vodka?

670
01:07:41,009 --> 01:07:42,761
I'd love some.

671
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:48,039
You like music?

672
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:51,167
I love also music.

673
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:54,280
That's a nice tape deck.

674
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:58,044
I buy it from friend of Lionel's
from back of truck. A ghetto blaster.

675
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:01,446
It's a good thing
you found Lionel in your life.

676
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:04,279
This tape I bring from Russia.

677
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:08,238
It is great Wild Bill Hawthorn,
black saxophonist.

678
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:10,679
I tape from Radio Free Europe.

679
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:14,601
It's nice music.

680
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:36,322
Would you like to dance?

681
01:08:41,169 --> 01:08:42,522
Why not?

682
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,882
You miss ltaly?

683
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:58,007
No, I don't miss ltaly at all.

684
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:01,883
I miss my family. My brothers, my sisters.

685
01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:06,759
When I make it big, I'll bring them all here.
They'll love it.

686
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,642
Now, my mother's a very nice lady...

687
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:14,280
...but she's into that black dress for life,
so she better stay there.

688
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:17,679
When I go back to Brooklyn...

689
01:09:17,769 --> 01:09:21,967
...and the Russian stores...

690
01:09:22,049 --> 01:09:24,358
...the smells remind me of home.

691
01:09:24,809 --> 01:09:28,404
And I know I can't go back,
but at least you can go back.

692
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:32,607
No, I don't want to go back.
I want to stay here. I'm very good here.

693
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:39,521
You smell very good.

694
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:42,842
It's Charlie.

695
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:45,804
-No, it's not perfume.
-Yes, it is.

696
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:47,808
It's you.

697
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,041
I really like you.

698
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:54,403
Likewise.

699
01:09:55,809 --> 01:09:57,208
But I am....

700
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:01,567
-You have boyfriend?
-No.

701
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:06,288
I am a free woman.
I don't like to get involved.

702
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:07,643
Me, too.

703
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:13,809
What I mean is
that if I stay here with you tonight...

704
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:17,644
...l don't want you to think
anything special about it.

705
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:22,644
To exaggerate what it is. You understand?

706
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:24,238
Yes.

707
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:28,682
I assure you as former citizen
of the Soviet Socialist Republic...

708
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:31,369
...l make no moral thought about sex.

709
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:34,089
I respect your new life.

710
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:37,758
Thanks.

711
01:10:44,249 --> 01:10:47,207
But I do desire you in a big way.

712
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:49,843
Likewise.

713
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:45,558
I take FDR Drive, sir, to beat the traffic.

714
01:11:46,089 --> 01:11:49,798
Whatever you say.
This is my first trip to NYC.

715
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:53,327
You relax, sir.
There's Perrier in the side bar.

716
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:57,084
TV is working.
I think General Hospital is on.

717
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:01,244
-What time is it, by the way?
-12:00 in five minutes.

718
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:04,560
I had my damn watch stolen
out at the airport last night.

719
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:06,446
Really? That's a bitch.

720
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:09,999
Went into the washroom,
took my Rollie off, set her on the basin...

721
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:12,557
...stepped back
to shake the dew off my lily...

722
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:15,163
...turned around,
and she was gone like that.

723
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:18,486
-I'd like you to check this out.
-What's that?

724
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:20,639
It's a digital. It's Japanese.

725
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:23,527
Touch gives you heartbeat
and body temperature.

726
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:28,485
-What part of Texas are you from?
-The East Village, sir. Seventh Street.

727
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:30,480
You sound further away than that.

728
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:33,965
I have a fountain pen with an alarm clock
built in. Check this out.

729
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:37,325
You've got your hand on the bucket
and you're headed toward the well.

730
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:39,604
I also sell vitamins. Look at this.

731
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,682
"True Nature." It's a six-pack of health.
It's great for your sex life.

732
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,282
Gives you the dick of death.

733
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,288
I'd like to trade me some flat
for some round.

734
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:51,167
Pluck one of them long-stemmed
American beauties.

735
01:12:51,249 --> 01:12:54,764
A little shaky pudding.
But get me to my hotel on time.

736
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:57,927
Just relax, sir. I give you great limo.

737
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:12,842
-I liked E. T. better.
-I think it was decadent.

738
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:15,079
I think it was fun and sexy.

739
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:18,998
It was childish.
It had no point of view, no moral content.

740
01:13:19,089 --> 01:13:22,445
On the Lucia Lombardo scale of one to ten,
I give it a seven.

741
01:13:22,889 --> 01:13:26,006
-You're reviewing film for the masses?
-No, but it's a fantasy.

742
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:27,881
You want fantasy, let's go to my place.

743
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:31,882
I can't. I have to study.
I have a class tomorrow.

744
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:36,366
-All she does is go to classes.
-Don't get possessive, okay?

745
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:39,608
I think I'm going to go back in
and see the movie.

746
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:43,045
I understand your liberation,
but what will you do with these classes?

747
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:45,597
I can do anything. This is America.

748
01:13:46,129 --> 01:13:48,359
Let me know if you find something for me.

749
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:51,486
You make a mountain out of mothballs.
All I said was let's go.

750
01:13:51,569 --> 01:13:55,164
-Yeah, because you want sex.
-Why not? Sex is good for you.

751
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:57,479
I'll see you sex fiends later.

752
01:13:57,649 --> 01:13:59,162
-See you.
-'Bye.

753
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:06,166
No, just let go.

754
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,161
-God.
-I'm sorry.

755
01:14:11,169 --> 01:14:14,002
-You're not my boss.
-You're right.

756
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:18,486
-This can only work if we are equal.
-I agree.

757
01:14:36,769 --> 01:14:41,047
If all Russians could eat Mu Shu Pork,
they wouldn't be afraid of the Chinese.

758
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:45,521
Tell me,
are all the Russians as funny as you?

759
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:53,357
You have beautiful lamb chops.
Did anyone ever tell you that?

760
01:14:53,569 --> 01:14:54,558
Yes.

761
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:57,440
You're happy all the time?

762
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:04,727
Sometimes, in the middle of the night,
I sit up and wonder where I am.

763
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:07,517
In Russia, you do that all day long.

764
01:15:12,369 --> 01:15:14,405
You want to help me study?

765
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:22,882
What is the date
of the Declaration of lndependence?

766
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:25,724
July 4, 1776.

767
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:31,009
What did
the Declaration of lndependence say?

768
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,957
That all men are created equal...

769
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:37,805
...and that they are given
certain rights inalienable.

770
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:39,368
Inalienable.

771
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:46,844
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

772
01:15:49,289 --> 01:15:52,247
Stop it now. Help me study.

773
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:55,083
Be cool.

774
01:15:55,809 --> 01:15:57,879
What is the Bill of Rights?

775
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,442
The Bill of Rights...

776
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:04,608
...is the first ten amendments
of the Constitution.

777
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:09,959
Freedom of religion, of speech.

778
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:14,318
Freedom of peaceful assembly.

779
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:17,721
Freedom of the press.

780
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:22,766
Freedom of holding meetings.

781
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:27,408
Freedom of...

782
01:16:29,409 --> 01:16:30,808
...sex.

783
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:33,040
The right to arm bears.

784
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:37,923
Unreasonable search.

785
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,078
Vlad, this is Lucia's Uncle Sal.

786
01:16:58,009 --> 01:16:59,567
Lucia told me about you.

787
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:00,923
Likewise.

788
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:03,359
This is my mama and my wife.

789
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:05,407
How do you do, Mother?

790
01:17:05,489 --> 01:17:07,923
That is my wife. This is my mama.

791
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,884
All rise for the Honourable Judge
Louise R. Reynolds.

792
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:15,808
You may sit.

793
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,964
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

794
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:24,482
Today you will become citizens
of the United States of America.

795
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:29,206
No longer are you an Englishman,
ltalian, or Pole, or whatever.

796
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:32,487
Neither will you be
a hyphenated American.

797
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:38,203
From this day, you are no longer a subject
of a government...

798
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:41,565
...but an integral part of the government.
A free man.

799
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,804
May you find in this nation...

800
01:17:44,889 --> 01:17:49,280
...the fulfilment of your dreams
of peace and security...

801
01:17:49,889 --> 01:17:53,086
...and may America, in turn,
never find you wanting...

802
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:57,999
...in your new proud role
of citizen of the United States.

803
01:17:58,769 --> 01:18:01,158
Will the petitioners please rise?

804
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:04,802
Now, let us take the oath of allegiance.

805
01:18:05,129 --> 01:18:07,165
"I hereby declare, on oath...

806
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:12,807
"...that I absolutely and entirely renounce...

807
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:19,044
"...all allegiance and fidelity...

808
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:24,767
"...to any foreign prince or potentate...

809
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:32,120
"...that I will support and defend
the Constitution and laws...

810
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:39,242
"...of the United States of America...

811
01:18:41,129 --> 01:18:43,165
"...against all enemies.

812
01:18:45,369 --> 01:18:48,167
"I take this obligation freely...

813
01:18:51,049 --> 01:18:54,166
"...without any mental reservation...

814
01:18:56,929 --> 01:18:58,885
"...or purpose of evasion...

815
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,007
"...so help me God."

816
01:19:04,209 --> 01:19:06,245
Congratulations, citizens.

817
01:20:18,729 --> 01:20:20,640
A wonderful day, I think.

818
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:28,884
-You have period today?
-No, why?

819
01:20:29,049 --> 01:20:32,598
-You're so serious.
-It was an emotional day.

820
01:20:33,689 --> 01:20:35,327
I'm just tired.

821
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:38,367
Goddamn it!

822
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:42,448
What? I'm sorry. I can't help myself.

823
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:48,401
-Nightcap?
-No.

824
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,561
What's the matter?

825
01:20:53,809 --> 01:20:56,403
You don't like a man being crazy
for your sweet zhopka?

826
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:59,640
-Not with my Uncle Sal around.
-Uncle Sal is sleeping.

827
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:02,085
Why doesn't he like Russians?

828
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:05,600
He thinks you're a Communist.

829
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:09,682
You know what I think?
I think we should move in together.

830
01:21:11,729 --> 01:21:15,688
I think you should live with me.
That way we save on rent, utilities.

831
01:21:15,769 --> 01:21:19,284
You don't have to take the "A" train
to make love with me.

832
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:24,685
-What do you think?
-I don't feel like talking now.

833
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:27,843
You don't have to talk.
Just tell me what you think.

834
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:30,682
Haven't you ever felt like not talking
about something?

835
01:21:30,769 --> 01:21:33,442
In Russia that's permanent way of life.

836
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:36,565
Just give me some vodka.

837
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:40,238
You don't care for me?

838
01:21:42,609 --> 01:21:45,681
-That's the problem.
-Problem, why?

839
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:47,839
I think I care too much.

840
01:21:48,089 --> 01:21:50,523
Come here.
You know how much I love you?

841
01:21:50,609 --> 01:21:52,804
Don't! It makes it worse.

842
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:55,323
-Just leave off of me.
-What?

843
01:21:55,409 --> 01:21:57,639
I have worked, okay?

844
01:21:57,729 --> 01:22:01,404
I have worked and struggled
to make myself an American.

845
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:02,888
An American!

846
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:07,358
I want to be in love with someone
who fits with my....

847
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:11,361
Okay. Now I understand.

848
01:22:12,089 --> 01:22:14,398
I'm not Robert Redford. Okay.

849
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:20,166
-I didn't mean it that way.
-What the hell do you mean?

850
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:24,606
Don't you understand? It's too fast.
I'm not ready for this. I don't want this.

851
01:22:25,209 --> 01:22:27,404
I'm not ready for full-time love yet.

852
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:30,481
That's fine. I don't love you.

853
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:33,927
What do you mean, you don't love me?
Yes, you do love me!

854
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:37,359
You are big American.
Okay, congratulations, citizen!

855
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:43,805
Communist Pope killer!

856
01:22:45,049 --> 01:22:46,801
There goes the neighbourhood.

857
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:03,166
Let me tell you, she's not the only piece
of pasta on the menu...

858
01:23:03,249 --> 01:23:05,524
...so you have to make a move
for something else.

859
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:06,803
Be difficult?

860
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:10,487
Hello, sweet thing.

861
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,163
Don't turn up your nose, honey,
it blocks the light.

862
01:23:22,089 --> 01:23:24,808
Come on, Vlad, we're already here.
Let's go.

863
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,844
It's time to make a move.

864
01:23:33,329 --> 01:23:35,047
Hello, sweet thing.

865
01:23:36,889 --> 01:23:39,926
Don't turn up your light to me,
it blocks the nose.

866
01:23:45,569 --> 01:23:47,048
Vodka? Double.

867
01:23:47,849 --> 01:23:50,044
I can't do this. That's Wild Bill Hawthorn.

868
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:52,560
I got a surprise for you tonight.

869
01:23:53,249 --> 01:23:57,481
I found out from a friend of mine
that we have a musician, a Russian.

870
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:01,842
His name is Vladimir lvanoff.

871
01:24:02,449 --> 01:24:04,167
A nice round for lvanoff.

872
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:14,439
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you, sir.

873
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:23,526
I played over in the Soviet Union in 1964.

874
01:24:24,889 --> 01:24:26,322
Yeah, I know.

875
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,643
Do you know the song or blues to Yolanda?

876
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:32,560
Why don't you sit in with us on it?

877
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:46,281
I got smoked, man.

878
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:49,207
You didn't get smoked.
What did you expect from the man?

879
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:54,287
What are you doing?

880
01:25:55,329 --> 01:25:58,366
Better to know who you are.
That way you know your limits.

881
01:25:58,449 --> 01:26:00,440
You know who the hell you are.

882
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:03,362
All he said was practice and work on it.

883
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:06,880
-No, man, I am shit.
-You're full of shit.

884
01:26:08,249 --> 01:26:10,285
-By the way, you are white.
-Thank you.

885
01:26:10,609 --> 01:26:13,965
You just don't pick up soul
in two or three months...

886
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,325
...even if you are Russian.

887
01:26:16,569 --> 01:26:20,198
And I'll tell you something else,
that self-pity won't get you nowhere.

888
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:23,324
The saddest thing in the world is life.

889
01:26:23,409 --> 01:26:24,922
You telling me?

890
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:28,639
It gets so bad,
sometimes I don't think I'll make it.

891
01:26:30,289 --> 01:26:32,359
Did I ever tell you I had a kid?

892
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:37,284
I met this girl, she got pregnant
and went back home to Alabama.

893
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,924
Thomas Alva Witherspoon, 5 years old.

894
01:26:40,009 --> 01:26:43,763
-That's wonderful.
-When I think of that kid, I want to cry.

895
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:46,127
Why don't you cry?

896
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:49,967
-It's good for you.
-I don't have to cry.

897
01:26:52,569 --> 01:26:55,766
When I was in Russia,
I did not love my life...

898
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:59,123
...but I loved my misery.

899
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:00,962
You know why?

900
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:03,799
Because it was my misery.

901
01:27:04,889 --> 01:27:07,084
I could hold it.

902
01:27:07,609 --> 01:27:09,759
I could caress it.

903
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:13,043
I loved my misery.

904
01:27:15,049 --> 01:27:19,998
You know, I have a whole family
I will never ever see again.

905
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:32,360
You see? Now you see.
You know it. There it is.

906
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:36,928
Now you know that the saddest thing
in the world is life.

907
01:27:37,249 --> 01:27:39,763
Yeah, man. Now you see.

908
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:04,999
Thank you.
Thank you for a wonderful night.

909
01:28:05,169 --> 01:28:07,080
Boy, I feel great.

910
01:28:08,529 --> 01:28:11,248
Take care. I love you.

911
01:28:17,849 --> 01:28:21,637
If that was wonderful, what happens
when he hits deep depression?

912
01:28:31,049 --> 01:28:34,166
Do you want to smell? You like it?

913
01:28:42,169 --> 01:28:46,481
If she doesn't like it, you can bring it back.
But don't lose the sales slip.

914
01:28:46,569 --> 01:28:49,766
-Okay, thank you very much.
-You're welcome. Have a nice day.

915
01:28:58,249 --> 01:28:59,807
What are you doing here?

916
01:28:59,889 --> 01:29:02,403
-You must to help me.
-What do you want?

917
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:04,559
I'm looking for blue jeans.

918
01:29:09,809 --> 01:29:11,162
I love you.

919
01:29:11,409 --> 01:29:14,207
I don't want to argue with you, Vladimir.

920
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:16,042
I know you love me, too.

921
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:19,686
Defections are in the blue jeans
department, fellow.

922
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:22,203
-What's happening?
-Hi, Lucy.

923
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:23,842
How are you?

924
01:29:23,929 --> 01:29:25,442
I got some news.

925
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:27,846
-I'm turning in my badge.
-Why?

926
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:32,358
-I was due a raise and it didn't come.
-What are you going to do now?

927
01:29:32,649 --> 01:29:35,038
I'm going to Alabama to see the kid.

928
01:29:35,729 --> 01:29:38,402
That's good for you, but sad for us.

929
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:41,162
-I'll miss you.
-Why don't you two come see me?

930
01:29:42,569 --> 01:29:44,207
We give you a call.

931
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:48,961
I want toilet water.

932
01:29:49,729 --> 01:29:52,163
Tonight, we go and make party.

933
01:29:52,249 --> 01:29:55,719
-No, I don't want to go with you.
-For Lionel. Why don't you want to go?

934
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:57,367
I don't want to argue.

935
01:29:57,569 --> 01:29:59,321
I want toilet water.

936
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:06,318
If I go now, I don't ever come back, okay?
You hear me now?

937
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,128
I hear you now.

938
01:30:11,889 --> 01:30:13,163
Goodbye.

939
01:30:18,089 --> 01:30:20,523
-I want toilet water.
-For you.

940
01:31:14,009 --> 01:31:15,237
Man.

941
01:31:22,329 --> 01:31:25,207
Thank you, Lionel.
Thank you for everything.

942
01:31:26,129 --> 01:31:27,847
You've been greatest friend to me.

943
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:29,847
I'm just a citizen.

944
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:37,083
You keep your pecker in your pocket.

945
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:24,678
Glad you came up here, Vladimir.

946
01:32:25,089 --> 01:32:28,320
Just wanted to check in. How you feeling?

947
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:29,882
Good and bad.

948
01:32:30,009 --> 01:32:32,807
The feet have been swelling up,
so I got to keep them up.

949
01:32:32,889 --> 01:32:35,119
-Or so they say.
-You look good.

950
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:37,882
Shit, don't get old if you can help it.

951
01:32:38,409 --> 01:32:41,048
In Russia, we honour the old people.
We take care of them.

952
01:32:41,129 --> 01:32:43,120
I think I move out there.

953
01:32:43,649 --> 01:32:45,367
Hello, sweet thing.

954
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:48,283
Don't turn up your nose, it blocks the light.

955
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:51,526
You hear from Lionel?

956
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:54,527
The boy sent a card. Says he's okay.

957
01:32:54,689 --> 01:32:56,327
Did he find work?

958
01:32:56,449 --> 01:32:59,725
I don't know,
but man do need to work to feel good.

959
01:33:00,929 --> 01:33:03,762
Next week, we get tickets,
we go to the ballgame.

960
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:09,048
-I'd love to if my feet are better.
-They'll be better.

961
01:33:09,769 --> 01:33:12,522
-Take care, Pops.
-So long, Vladimir.

962
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:34,048
Who is it?

963
01:33:38,609 --> 01:33:39,598
Who are you?

964
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:44,284
Who the hell are you, KGB?

965
01:33:44,929 --> 01:33:47,443
I have a letter for you. From your family.

966
01:33:51,729 --> 01:33:52,718
A letter?

967
01:33:53,769 --> 01:33:54,997
Give it to me.

968
01:34:01,689 --> 01:34:02,838
Come in.

969
01:34:10,929 --> 01:34:12,408
Where did you get this?

970
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:17,563
I knew your sister, Sasha, at school.

971
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:21,840
How did you get it here? To America?

972
01:34:21,929 --> 01:34:27,083
We were permitted to leave
after only three years. We are Jewish.

973
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:45,083
You have a beautiful home.

974
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:49,248
Bad news?

975
01:34:52,649 --> 01:34:54,560
My grandfather died.

976
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:01,486
He was a comedian.

977
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:16,565
I will leave you, Vladimir lvanoff.

978
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:22,727
Thank you.
Please call me when you get settled.

979
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:48,597
It's New York.

980
01:35:55,529 --> 01:35:56,757
Goodbye.

981
01:36:16,209 --> 01:36:18,325
Shut up down there!

982
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:22,647
It's not a nightclub, asshole!

983
01:36:43,209 --> 01:36:45,882
If you're looking for trouble, you'll get it!

984
01:36:49,289 --> 01:36:52,998
You don't like jazz, pal? He was comedian.

985
01:36:53,089 --> 01:36:55,478
He don't care about nobody.

986
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:59,762
Hey, you fuck yourself!
Okay, pal? Okay, mister!

987
01:39:47,169 --> 01:39:49,444
Hold still, motherfucker!

988
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:51,560
-Who are you?
-Where's the money?

989
01:39:51,649 --> 01:39:54,209
-Why you do this?
-Just shut the fuck up!

990
01:39:54,289 --> 01:39:56,644
-I am Russian.
-You're no fucking Russian!

991
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:58,879
I am Russian!

992
01:40:07,969 --> 01:40:09,800
I am Russian!

993
01:40:23,089 --> 01:40:25,080
What was in the wallet besides money?

994
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:29,438
Some ID, driver's licence, Social Security.

995
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:33,046
Easily replaceable, my friend.
You want to go to a doctor?

996
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:34,198
No.

997
01:40:35,209 --> 01:40:37,598
This is a goddamn insane country.

998
01:40:38,529 --> 01:40:42,158
They were so young,
and their eyes were cold like animals.

999
01:40:43,249 --> 01:40:47,640
In Russia, I knew who the enemy was.
Here, it's too confusing.

1000
01:40:47,729 --> 01:40:49,321
You're overreacting.

1001
01:40:49,569 --> 01:40:52,447
I always heard
that Russians overdid things.

1002
01:40:53,849 --> 01:40:58,081
Is this liberty? lf it is, it's false liberty.
Where are the poets?

1003
01:40:58,169 --> 01:41:01,559
What do you want, a perfect place to live?
There's no such thing.

1004
01:41:01,649 --> 01:41:03,958
Police said, even if they catch them,
they go free.

1005
01:41:04,049 --> 01:41:07,359
They're juveniles.
They get away with a lot of crap.

1006
01:41:14,089 --> 01:41:16,478
-Can I help you, gentlemen?
-Two coffees, please.

1007
01:41:16,569 --> 01:41:18,639
-An apple turnover.
-Make it two.

1008
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:22,203
When you can't walk down the street,
is that freedom?

1009
01:41:22,769 --> 01:41:25,966
Do you really think
you were better off before in Russia?

1010
01:41:26,449 --> 01:41:29,725
It's freedom for a woman
to spread her legs like that on a magazine?

1011
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,887
Hey, pal, you free?

1012
01:41:35,649 --> 01:41:36,968
Excuse us.

1013
01:41:37,249 --> 01:41:38,523
There's no freedom here.

1014
01:41:38,609 --> 01:41:40,804
If there is, she's an orphan.

1015
01:41:42,369 --> 01:41:45,486
To tell you the truth,
New York frightens me.

1016
01:41:45,769 --> 01:41:47,760
It's brutal. It's crazy.

1017
01:41:51,569 --> 01:41:53,161
What are you staring at?

1018
01:41:53,249 --> 01:41:54,238
Take it easy--

1019
01:41:54,329 --> 01:41:58,481
Don't tell me to take it easy!
No one tells me take it easy anymore.

1020
01:41:58,689 --> 01:42:00,566
What are you staring at?

1021
01:42:03,489 --> 01:42:04,842
What did he say?

1022
01:42:04,929 --> 01:42:07,648
He says that he's looking at
a giant asshole from Moscow.

1023
01:42:10,369 --> 01:42:11,722
What's he saying now?

1024
01:42:11,809 --> 01:42:14,198
He said he's from Leningrad, giant asshole.

1025
01:42:16,209 --> 01:42:18,518
He's been here seven years and he loves it.

1026
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:24,402
He's telling me
to go back to Moscow, turd.

1027
01:42:24,569 --> 01:42:31,441
In Moscow,
we have to fight for a crumb of freedom.

1028
01:42:32,489 --> 01:42:35,242
Here, you shit on it!

1029
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:49,404
He says that if I want law and order...

1030
01:42:49,489 --> 01:42:51,764
...l should go back
and stand in line for bread.

1031
01:42:51,849 --> 01:42:53,248
Stale bread.

1032
01:42:54,289 --> 01:42:56,120
What the hell is that?

1033
01:42:57,009 --> 01:42:59,318
Firecrackers. Independence Day.

1034
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:12,048
I'm sorry.

1035
01:43:26,369 --> 01:43:28,007
Independence Day.

1036
01:43:28,329 --> 01:43:33,039
You know, it's, "When in the course
of human events, it becomes necessary...."

1037
01:43:33,689 --> 01:43:35,725
What is it? I forgot the rest.

1038
01:43:35,849 --> 01:43:38,807
"We hold these truths to be self-evident...

1039
01:43:39,489 --> 01:43:42,049
"...that all men are created equal...

1040
01:43:42,169 --> 01:43:44,729
"...that they are endowed

1041
01:43:44,809 --> 01:43:47,721

"Happiness."

1045
01:43:55,129 --> 01:43:56,244
Happiness.

1046
01:43:56,729 --> 01:43:58,003
Happiness.

1047
01:44:51,209 --> 01:44:52,688
What happened?

1048
01:44:53,929 --> 01:44:57,205
I got mugged. What are you doing here?

1049
01:44:59,049 --> 01:45:00,721
You want me to go?

1050
01:45:00,889 --> 01:45:02,845
No. It's a nice surprise.

1051
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:08,048
I came over because I was going
to leave the key here.

1052
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:10,644
Waiting for you, I fell asleep.

1053
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:15,284
You don't look very nice.
Are you sure you're fine?

1054
01:45:15,969 --> 01:45:18,085
I'm strong like Russian bear.

1055
01:45:18,169 --> 01:45:20,478
-How you been?
-I've been okay.

1056
01:45:26,769 --> 01:45:28,805
I've missed you very much.

1057
01:45:31,329 --> 01:45:32,523
Me, too.

1058
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:38,844
I'm not ready for marriage yet...

1059
01:45:39,689 --> 01:45:42,647
...but I would love to live
with an immigrant.

1060

"Beloved family:
I received the news of Grandfather's death.

A hot dog, please.

1068
01:46:43,889 --> 01:46:46,403
Don't worry, my friend. I'm retired.

1069
01:46:46,649 --> 01:46:48,924
Yeah? What are you doing here?

1070
01:46:49,849 --> 01:46:53,205
Did you think I could go back to Moscow
after what happened?

1071
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:56,245
-Have you been well?
-Yeah.

1072
01:46:58,169 --> 01:47:00,319
-It's a strange country?
-Yes.

1073
01:47:00,609 --> 01:47:02,440
Strange and wonderful.

1074

-Can I say thank you?
-Sure.

1075

Put your money away.

It's a good hot dog.
