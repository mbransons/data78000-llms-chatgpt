1
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,023
'My sweet Jesus.'

2
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:00,029
'We pray once more
for Ed and Jack Biddle.'

3
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,017
Hear my plea for your
lost lambs, father.

4
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,024
Suffering injustice

5
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:08,023
at the hands of evil,
unrighteous men.

6
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:12,013
Give those boys strength, Jesus.

7
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,013
Show them mercy.

8
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,003
'Fill their hearts
with the hope'

9
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,014
'that only you can
give, dear Jesus.'

10
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:21,021
'You know their innocence.'

11
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:25,015
'If there is a way,
if it is your will..'

12
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,019
'...do not let them die.'

13
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:31,000
'They do not deserve
to die, Jesus.'

14
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,019
'Dear father'

15
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,000
'hear my plea
for your lost lambs.'

16
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,012
'Hear my..'

17
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,007
'Go back to bed now.'

18
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,021
'All of you! Go on.'

19
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,022
'Get back to bed, Clarence.'

20
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,017
'Go on.'

21
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,024
'Peter.'

22
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,001
'I dreamt that I was lost
in snowstorm.'

23
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:38,003
'And I couldn't breathe.'

24
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,025
'Somebody pulled me out
to a clear spot.'

25
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:45,028
Lord, Kate.

26
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,023
'Poor Peter.
I wear you out.'

27
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:52,017
- No.
- 'Peter?'

28
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:54,018
'Here, drink this.
It'll help you sleep.'

29
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,003
Peter.

30
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,018
I know what the dream means.

31
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,009
I'm gonna get better.

32
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,003
God was telling me

33
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,024
'he's not gonna let me die.'

34
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,029
Yes, yes.

35
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,023
Yes. Drink this now.

36
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,026
Go on.

37
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:18,002
'Drink this.
It'll help you sleep.'

38
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:19,018
'Go on, now. Go on.'

39
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,028
'Express!
Biddles' appeal today!'

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,010
'Morning Express!'

41
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,013
Thank you, son.

42
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:31,028
Here we go..

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,011
Move it along, please.

44
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,024
...at the hands of evil,
unrighteous men..

45
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,020
Alright, Mrs..
Move!

46
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,010
Hurry, kids.
Get out of the street.

47
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,013
'Free the Biddles!
Free the Biddles!'

48
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,026
'Free the Biddles!
Free the Biddles!'

49
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,012
I'm sorry, Jessie.
I asked, and they said no.

50
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:58,022
I just want to see him.

51
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,001
I know you do. Sorry.

52
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:05,019
Let's go over there.
Sir, sir?

53
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,024
Excuse me, sir.

54
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,005
- I made this for Ed.
- For you.

55
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,005
No, thanks. I can't.
It's against the rules.

56
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:12,001
Would you please
give this to Jack?

57
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,014
- Just for us.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

58
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:19,019
Please, sir?

59
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,008
'Good morning, pinhead!'

60
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,006
'Thank you!'

61
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:30,001
Bloody kids!

62
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,010
'No, I'll never shoot another!'

63
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:35,021
'Clarence Soffel,
you've been so bad!'

64
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:37,011
'Please, please.
Please don't kill me!'

65
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,008
I'll take you away
to Murderers' Row

66
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,021
and lock you up
forever and ever.

67
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:45,011
I'll never shoot anyone again!
Please!

68
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,019
'Let's hope that the governor
will see it our way.'

69
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,009
Clarence! Scat!

70
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,023
Hurry! Hurry!

71
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:18,007
I'm sorry, boys. Really sorry.
We did the best we could.

72
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,027
I mean, yes, you get the two of
us hanged for the one murder.

73
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:26,011
That's a pretty neat trick.

74
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,017
- Thanks.
- Come on, boys.

75
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,006
Hey, fellas, don't forget
to send us your bill.

76
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:40,007
'Margaret, Eddie, Clarence.'

77
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,027
'I understand you were playing
in an area'

78
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,006
where you're not allowed,
and now you're late for school.

79
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,020
Is that right?

80
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,017
Three little criminals.

81
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,016
Do you children understand
how hard your sister works

82
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:57,026
to take care of you
and me and your poor mama?

83
00:07:57,028 --> 00:08:00,022
And when you do something
that's disruptive and wrong

84
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,018
'you have to be punished,
don't you?'

85
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,006
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,021
'Answer papa, Margaret.'

87
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,003
I'm thinking.

88
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:14,012
Well, I think the sentence
can be suspended

89
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:15,026
'this time, court is
dismissed.'

90
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:19,001
Mama! Mama, you're up!
Are you better?

91
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:20,024
Yes, I'm better.
I'm all better.

92
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,009
Mama, what are you doing
out of bed?

93
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,019
I'm all well.

94
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:25,023
Daddy suspended us
from our punishment.

95
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,009
Did he?

96
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,029
'Irene, tell Maggie
to fetch the doctor.'

97
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,004
Oh, no. Really, Peter.

98
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,014
He never knew
what was wrong with me.

99
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't see what he can do
for me now.

100
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,024
How can anyone be sick in bed
for three months

101
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:37,002
and suddenly get up one
morning and say she's fine?

102
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:40,001
- It doesn't make sense.
- Please, Peter.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,014
I don't need to see the doctor.

104
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,004
Well, then everyone better
get off to school then.

105
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:48,004
Come on, come on,
they're late already.

106
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,022
Come on, lamebrain.

107
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,017
- Who appointed you warden?
- You Clarence.

108
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,020
You hush up.

109
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,002
Good afternoon.

110
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,017
Good afternoon.

111
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,019
Harold.

112
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,019
It's good to have you back,
Mrs. Soffel.

113
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,020
Would you like a Bible?

114
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,000
'I've been getting sick'

115
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,005
'of all these boys
and their ugly faces.'

116
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,005
It never changes,
does it, George?

117
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,015
No, ma'am,
I suppose not.

118
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,025
'Why don't you come up here'

119
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,006
'and visit with me, cutie?'

120
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:26,023
- You hush up!
- Good afternoon.

121
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:31,021
Why, Lenny, I thought
you left us last September.

122
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:34,006
Mrs. Soffel, they can always
find something to blame

123
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,001
on an honest fellow like me.

124
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:37,021
But you'll be pleased
to hear I went to church

125
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,007
four times when I was out.

126
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:41,005
It doesn't look like
it did you much good.

127
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,015
I need a quarter from you,
George, for the pool.

128
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,019
You get on with your work.

129
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,000
He gives me the willies.

130
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,002
Betting on when
somebody's gonna hang.

131
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,016
- Mrs. Soffel.
- Hello.

132
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,026
Thanks.

133
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,018
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

134
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,016
'Why, Charlie, leave 'em be.
They ain't hurting nothing.'

135
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,023
Warden Soffel believes

136
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:23,010
a man's cell reflects
a man's moral character.

137
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:26,006
'We haven't got
any moral character, Charlie.'

138
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:29,006
We're murderers.
Ain't that right, Jackie?

139
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,026
Does your brother always
fight
your battles for you, Jackie?

140
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:35,025
Hey!

141
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,021
Get in there! Go on!

142
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,016
You're dead.

143
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,004
Oh, I hear it's the other way
around, Eddie.

144
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,021
Stand back from the door
for inspection.

145
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,020
- Ed!
- Jesus!

146
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,018
'No!'

147
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,029
'Stop it!'

148
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,000
Stop it!

149
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:14,009
Get up!

150
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,003
- Mrs. Soffel, you're bleeding!
- No.

151
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,024
- You're hurt.
- No, no. It's his blood.

152
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,025
Easy!

153
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,018
Easy!

154
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,013
'Leave him be, you bastards!'

155
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,014
You'd better give me your arm,
ma'am. You look a little pale.

156
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:28,000
No. No, thank you,
Mr. Reynolds.

157
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,005
Here, wipe your face.

158
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,002
- Go on, go on. Go on.
- Thank you.

159
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,023
Mrs. Soffel,
Warden Soffel's wife.

160
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:40,010
Go tell the warden we got a
prisoner who needs cooling off...

161
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,020
'You started it!'

162
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:43,005
We've got four more cells
down there!

163
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,029
'Never mind, Jack.'

164
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,000
'A couple of hungry days
will do Eddie's soul good.'

165
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:59,004
'Where'd you get that scar
on your face, Mr. Biddle?'

166
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:01,000
When they arrested me
and Jack.

167
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,020
'They shot you?'

168
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:06,008
No, ma'am, I shot myself.
I meant to kill myself.

169
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,027
'Don't you read the papers?'

170
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:12,008
Well, I'm very sorry.

171
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,016
What are you sorry for?

172
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,011
Would you like a Bible,
Mr. Biddle?

173
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,004
What are you sorry for?

174
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,017
- 'Cause we're gonna hang?
- 'Yes.'

175
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:27,015
Don't you think murderers
ought to be hanged?

176
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:30,003
I don't believe in hanging.
Take it.

177
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,027
- You want a Bible, Jack?
- No. I want a smoke.

178
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,012
No, thank you, ma'am.

179
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,029
We're gonna die,
but we're not that desperate.

180
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:51,009
Mrs. Soffel, the warden says
to put him in.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,002
Well, Jack, at least
I won't have to listen

182
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,017
to you snore tonight.

183
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,025
That's right.

184
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:06,004
Mrs. Soffel?

185
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:11,011
What kind of flower would you
say that is, right there?

186
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,017
I don't know.

187
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,017
Would you say that
that's a violet?

188
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,029
I think it's a violet,
don't you?

189
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,014
- Yes.
- I think so, too.

190
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:36,009
George said you met
the Biddles today.

191
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,024
- Don't you think Ed's handsome?
- Not especially.

192
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,019
'There's the supper bell,
finally.'

193
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,005
Margaret.

194
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,010
What is all this?

195
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,015
That's Ed. That's Jack.

196
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,011
And that's Ed's girl,
Jessie.
She's an actress.

197
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:09,017
This is a very pretty book
that your grandma gave you

198
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,025
and you were meant
to press flowers in it.

199
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,001
I'm making a record
of all the injustice

200
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,012
the Biddles have suffered.

201
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,021
They don't belong in prison.

202
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:19,021
They do
if they killed somebody.

203
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:22,015
Mama, Ed and Jack
are innocent.

204
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:25,019
It was their partner
who shot the grocer in the head.

205
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,010
A jury found them guilty,
sweetheart.

206
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,000
'And after considering
and asking..'

207
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:32,005
'Are you listening?'

208
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,027
'Are you listening?'

209
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,021
'And asking the Lord
for guidance'

210
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,013
'the judge gave them
their sentence.'

211
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:41,027
But, mama, the Biddles committed
90 robberies in 90 days

212
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,013
and never hurt one citizen.

213
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:46,007
Doman's a dope addict.

214
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:48,018
'That's enough!'

215
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
Come on, Margaret.
Go to bed.

216
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,016
It's a wonder you don't have
nightmares, young lady.

217
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:59,020
Do you know that?

218
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:02,016
I do.
I dream about the boys.

219
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,026
Mm-hmm. Get into bed.

220
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,025
I'm afraid papa will
have a curse on his head

221
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,000
for hanging them.

222
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,000
Go on, go on, go on.

223
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,002
Let me tell you
one more thing.

224
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,014
No.

225
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,023
No.

226
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:18,008
I want you to be quiet
and go to sleep.

227
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,003
They had to pick
the grocer's brain off the wall.

228
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,019
You've got one big imagination,
you know

229
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:31,027
that's going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

230
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,001
Yes, I'm afraid the devil is
winning the battle for my soul.

231
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,008
Then I think
you better say your prayers.

232
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,020
Through the river
and into the fire

233
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:44,026
little girls go
when they expire..

234
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,023
Father in heaven..

235
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,018
- Father in heaven..
- ...as night draws near..

236
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,028
- ...as night draws near..
- ...I beseech thee to hear..

237
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,023
...I beseech thee to hear
my humble prayer.

238
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:00,024
Keep me ever from doing wrong,
keep me..

239
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:03,029
Keep me safe, keep me strong.

240
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,019
And keep me a Christian
my whole life long.

241
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,020
- Amen.
- Amen.

242
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:10,024
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

243
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:13,015
Are you gonna go to sleep?

244
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,026
Alright.

245
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,018
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

246
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,028
Goodnight.

247
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:38,003
Goodnight, Peter.

248
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,004
Kate.

249
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,020
I was just...wondering

250
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:45,001
now that you're feeling
better..

251
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:48,006
...you'll be continuing
to use your own room?

252
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,026
I think I better for now.

253
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,013
It was just a question.

254
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:12,017
Eh, left, left, left.

255
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,016
Farther apart, Johnny.

256
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:16,010
Two in a row?
That what you want to see?

257
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,020
- That what you're asking for?
- 'I'll give you a cigar.'

258
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,027
Watch now, brother.

259
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:23,007
'Come on, lads. Push up.'

260
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,023
Stevens!

261
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,015
Six.

262
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,017
'Just take two
out of the cart, Agnes.'

263
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,001
'I think that's all
we'll need for now.'

264
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,028
- 'Alright..'
- Thank you.

265
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,015
How about a blanket, Mr. Biddle?
The cold's getting fierce now.

266
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,010
Thank you, ma'am.

267
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,027
Mr. Biddle?

268
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,024
I'll just, just leave it here,
for you. Ready, Agnes?

269
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:01,003
Why don't you peddle that
to somebody stupid enough

270
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,023
to believe it?

271
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:06,003
What did you give it
to me for, anyway?

272
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,018
I would've thought
God's word might have been

273
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,029
some comfort to you,
but I see I was wrong.

274
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,023
'"And behold a pale horse..'

275
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,003
"...and his name
that sat on him was Death.

276
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,004
"And hell followed with him.

277
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:20,027
'"And they were given power
over the Earth to kill..

278
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,028
'"...with sword,
and with hunger'

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,009
'and with death."'

280
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:27,007
That sounded pretty good, Ed.

281
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,024
Maybe you should've
been a preacher.

282
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:31,009
Did you mean to put the fear
of God in me, ma'am?

283
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:34,008
No. No and I wouldn't have
suggested starting

284
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,022
with the Revelation,
I usually recommend

285
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,019
something more soothing
for the prisoners.

286
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,029
'Do you?'

287
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,014
Yes, I do.

288
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:44,002
'There's a very lovely section
in Luke.'

289
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:46,029
Will you read it to me?

290
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,011
Yes.

291
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,017
Umm..

292
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,008
'"Blessed are ye
that hunger now'

293

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,018
'"Blessed are ye

'This is..'

'This is one
of my favorite parts.'

298
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:18,006
'"Blessed are ye..'

'"...and when they shall

'Don't people treat you and your
brother like that, Mr. Biddle?'

305
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:37,020
- Leave me out of it.
- 'Mrs. Soffel?'

306
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,024
'It's nearly my dinner hour.'

307
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:41,002
'Why don't you run along,
Agnes.'

308
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,021
'I'll be right there.'

309
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,009
'"Rejoice ye in that day,
and leap for joy'

310

for, behold, your reward
is great in heaven."

311
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,006
'What's my reward?'

312
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:55,021
Your heavenly reward.

313
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:57,025
You mean, God makes you
miserable in this life

314
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:59,011
so he can make you happy
in the next?

315
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,014
- Is that it?
- No. No.

316
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:04,021
I think it means, I think
it means that when you suffer

317
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:07,027
don't give up hope.

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,018
- Hope to go to heaven?
- 'Yes.'

319
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,015
Can you see me up there,
floating around

320
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:13,025
on a cloud, playing my harp
for the all saints?

321
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:15,015
- You wanna go to heaven, Jack?
- I don't know.

322
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,023
You know anybody
who's been there?

323
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,015
'No, I, I picture heaven..'

324
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:23,018
I picture heaven
as a place of peace.

325
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,002
Death would be peace.

326
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,017
'No, death is nothing.'

327
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,007
Why would God give us
this short life

328
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:32,017
with all of its troubles and not
give us a better one afterwards?

329
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:35,020
- ''Cause he doesn't care.'
- God cares.

330
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:38,006
God cares even for you.

331
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,017
Even for a dirty killer like me?

332
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,010
That isn't what I meant.

333
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,006
Do you think I'm a killer,
Mrs. Soffel?

334
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,001
Are you, Mr. Biddle?

335
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,024
Ed.

336
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,029
Are you a killer?

337
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,018
In my heart..

338
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,023
...I am.

339
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,011
'I want nothing more
than to send the filthy liar'

340
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:13,007
'that put us in here,
to his heaven.'

341
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:15,027
So I suppose
I am a murderer..

342
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,018
...in my heart.

343
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,014
'Ain't l, Kate?'

344
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:28,015
If you truly want
to commit murder...then, yes..

345
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:31,020
'...I think you are a murderer
in your heart.'

346
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:33,019
Then I guess
I'm not worth saving.

347
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,014
'Mrs. Soffel?'

348
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,022
I'm not.

349
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:45,016
I'm not, I'm not a murderer.

350
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:03,006
Quiet!

351
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:12,007
So they come up here
to put out the fire.

352
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:18,000
Then we grab them,
and we get their keys.

353
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:22,022
What if..

354
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,022
What if they don't come, huh?

355
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:29,006
I mean, what if they
just let us burn?

356
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,017
What?

357
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,028
What are you writing now,
our wills?

358
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:40,007
Six.

359
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,004
Jack?

360
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:13,005
'Jack?'

361
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,027
What?

362
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:19,010
'Where would you be now..'

363
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:21,002
'...if you hadn't met up
with me and Walter?'

364
00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:23,028
Oh, go to sleep.

365
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,010
'I told them you were
innocent.'

366
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,023
'And they believed Walter.'

367
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,018
'Didn't I try?'

368
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,022
Yeah, I know you did.

369
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:37,022
I can't die until
I make it up to you.

370
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:39,027
Stop talking about dying!

371
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,006
You're always talking like if..

372
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,014
Just go to sleep.

373
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,018
'I'm not gonna
let 'em hang you.'

374
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,006
'Believe me?'

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,023
'Little brother?'

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,025
- Ed.
- Well, do you believe me, Jack?

377
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:03,020
Sure.

378
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:05,025
Sure, I believe you.

379
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:18,010
- Mama?
- 'What is it, Irene?'

380
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:20,008
You left the heater
burning in the parlor.

381
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,003
I-I turned it down.

382
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:23,017
Thank you.

383
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,002
Did you just get home?

384
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,011
'Billy walked me
from fellowship meeting.'

385
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,018
Goodnight.

386
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,019
'Um, has Billy heard'

387
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,003
'from his school?'

388
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:37,028
Well, no, not yet.
But he's bound to get in.

389
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,005
It's turning into quite a
romance between the two of you.

390
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,010
It's not a <i>romance,</i><i>mama.</i>

391
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,016
I plan to marry Billy.

392
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:52,008
Well, we all have a lot
of time to think about that.

393
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,020
He's giving me an engagement
ring for Christmas.

394
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:56,006
- 'Irene.'
- Papa knows.

395
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:59,004
Irene, you're barely 16.

396
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,018
'And you were 17
when you married papa.'

397
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:10,026
Goodnight, mama.

398
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:13,029
You shouldn't sit by
the window, you'll catch cold.

399
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:23,026
My goodness, Maggie, I think
it's nearly frozen stiff.

400
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,029
'I know, but it smells musty.
Lordy be.'

401
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,018
Let's take it indoors.

402
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:32,021
- Hope I didn't startle you.
- 'No.'

403
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:40,016
That's a pretty dress
you got on.

404
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:42,007
'Back, Mr. Biddle!'

405
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,007
You'll come and read
to me again, won't you?

406
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:47,000
I come to the prison
every Tuesday and Thursday.

407
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:50,025
Maggie, the rug beater.

408
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:55,000
Maggie.

409
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:58,006
'"You may ask why,
in spite of all hope'

410
00:26:58,008 --> 00:27:00,015
'"do we maintain our
innocence?'

411
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:03,023
"Every intelligent mother
in Pittsburgh knows the reason.

412
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:06,023
Because it is true.
We would not..."

413
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,015
'Job's friends are arguing'

414
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,013
that if God has made
Job suffer so much

415
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,011
he must be guilty
of some great sin

416
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,025
because God doesn't
punish the innocent.

417
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:18,024
God punishes the innocent
all the time. Why is that, Kate?

418
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:21,014
- God means to test our love.
- By torturing us?

419
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,018
You don't have to tell me
that innocent people suffer.

420
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,003
I've been walking through this
prison for quite a few years...

421
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,028
- Oh, so you know all about it.
- I know enough.

422
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,018
You don't know
what it means to be in here.

423
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,015
'So don't pretend that you do.'

424
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:41,009
At any rate, nobody is
completely innocent.

425
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:45,018
'We all sin.'

426
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,010
God punishes you for
your sins, doesn't he, Kate?

427
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,013
I think you suffer.

428
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,022
'I don't come here to discuss'

429
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:55,006
'my sins with you.'

430
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,001
'There's a vision that I
have..'

431
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,029
'...of them..'

432
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,009
'...taking us out to hang.'

433
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:12,006
'And they take Jack up first..'

434
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,024
'...so I have to watch.'

435
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:22,026
That was a very good
letter you wrote.

436
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,010
'Ed?'

437
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,022
Maybe you'll hear
from the governor soon.

438
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,006
You'll make a prayer?

439
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,024
- 'Shall we do this again?'
- 'Do you like it?'

440
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:50,012
One, two, three, whoo!

441
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:55,006
- One, two and..
- Three!

442
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:57,022
- 'What happened, mama?'
- 'I don't know.'

443
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,016
Come on, everybody,
let's go around.

444
00:29:02,018 --> 00:29:04,014
Clarence, stop that.

445
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:08,001
Please, come on.
Margaret, come on.

446
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,017
Let's hurry. Come on.

447
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:19,004
'Good news, boys.'

448
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:02,023
'You wrote this?'

449
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,018
'That's right.'

450
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,005
- Would you read it to me?
- 'Sure.'

451
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:16,027
Don't laugh.

452

for what you gave to me.

- Sorry.
- 'What for?'

475
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:33,023
I think I should go now.

476
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:35,017
God didn't answer
your prayer, did he, Kate?

477
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,012
- My prayer?
- Well, didn't you pray for us?

478
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:38,012
Yes.

479
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,012
Well, then tell me

480
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,025
why does God want us
to die, Kate?

481
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:42,025
- Tell me the reason why.
- I can't do that.

482
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:45,002
Me and Jack, we're innocent.
We're innocent as snow.

483
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,018
- You know that.
- How can I know that?

484
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,018
Well because you know me
and I'm telling you, that's why.

485
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,028
- No! I have to go.
- You nearly had me saved.

486
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,029
- Let go of me, Ed!
- What are you doing?

487
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,011
- 'Let go!'
- 'What do you want from me?'

488
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:57,004
'What do you come
over here for?'

489
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:58,017
'I'll call the guard
if you don't let go of me!'

490
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,007
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

491
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:02,026
Press there!

492
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:04,023
There, you feel
how strong my neck is?

493
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,013
'Me and Jack, we aim
to break out of here.'

494
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:07,028
Damn you, Ed! You're crazy.

495
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,029
Are you gonna tell on us?
Are you gonna tell on us?

496
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,003
- Oh, God.
- God? God won't hear you.

497
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:14,015
You're not in church now.

498
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:24,019
I'm so-I'm sorry.

499
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,014
No.

500
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,002
You're our only friend
and I've hurt you.

501
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,009
No.

502
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,020
Guard?

503
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,013
Oh, dear father,
please forgive me.

504
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:11,001
Forgive me for being
such a terrible sinner.

505
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm so ashamed, dear father.

506
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,014
Please help and guide me.

507
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,021
Give me the strength
to overcome these thoughts.

508
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:19,025
Oh, God, I know I'm weak.
Forgive me for..

509
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,015
- 'Maggie.'
- Ma'am.

510
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,011
- 'Mr. Kelly.'
- Good morning, ma'am.

511
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:36,006
Good morning.

512
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:51,014
She ain't been to see you
for five days, has she?

513
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,022
She won't tell on us,
I promise.

514
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:02,016
What do you think you're doing?

515
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:05,001
What..

516
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,016
What do you think you're doing?

517
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:11,003
"My husband and I are dedicated
to the reform of criminals.

518
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:15,000
"But capital punishment does
not allow reform or mercy

519
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:18,011
and no chance to right
a miscarriage of justice."

520
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:21,016
'My God, Kate! The governor?'

521
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,008
"I join other Christian men
and women in this great city

522
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,002
"in urging you to grant
the Biddles' case

523
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,026
a-a-an official review."

524
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:31,003
Have you lost your senses?

525
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,020
You didn't write it.

526
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:34,022
I did. I signed it.

527
00:35:34,024 --> 00:35:36,012
Quite a few people
have written, Peter.

528
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,008
'They are not married
to the warden'

529
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,016
'of the Allegheny
County Prison!'

530
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,027
'Do you need
to see the doctor?'

531
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:43,029
No!

532
00:35:44,001 --> 00:35:45,029
Because that's how
you're acting!

533
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:51,008
Do you want me to lose my job?

534
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,011
- 'Do you?'
- No.

535
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:03,018
Maybe you need a rest.

536
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,009
Perhaps mother
could come to visit.

537
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:07,008
Or you could go to her

538
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,016
or you could go
to your sister's.

539
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,009
Peter.

540
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:14,029
Peter.

541
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,023
Do you think I'm unbalanced?

542
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:21,022
'Do you?'

543
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:28,014
Kate?

544
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:30,004
'Kate, if you won't go'

545
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:31,012
then I forbid you to visit
the prisoners...

546
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,013
Please, dear, not now!

547
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,019
You don't seem to be able to

548
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,029
separate your duties
from your sympathies...

549
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,004
It's not sympathy!
I think it's wrong!

550
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:39,016
That is not for you to decide!

551
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:46,004
Alright. Alright.

552
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,008
Write to Elsie or your
mother.

553
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,028
Wherever you wanna send me.

554
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:53,011
'Let's go in to supper.'

555
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:10,007
'Clarence.'

556
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,023
God is great, God is good

557
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:15,015
let us thank him
for our food. Amen.

558
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,023
- 'Amen.'
- 'Amen.'

559
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:28,011
Good evening, Warden.
Going out tonight?

560
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,011
Yes.

561
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,006
Oh, no.

562
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,029
George!

563
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,014
- 'George!'
- What?

564
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:03,022
- 'George!'
- Wait, just a second.

565
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:05,029
'We have to go to the Row!'

566
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,018
- 'Hurry, George!'
- Oh, Mrs. Soffel, please!

567
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,025
I could lose my job!

568
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:11,008
Please, George,
please hurry, there's a fire!

569
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,004
- What?
- There's a fire!

570
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,015
Wait..

571
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,015
Hurry!

572
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:21,024
'McGarey! There's a fire!'

573
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:26,020
Help! Fire! Fire!

574
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:28,004
Holy Christ!

575
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,005
Get him out!

576
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:32,025
'Help him!'

577
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:34,020
'Get him out!'

578
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,019
'Stop it! Help him, George!'

579
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:41,007
'Help him!'

580
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:45,005
- 'George, I can't..'
- Alright, alright.

581
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,020
'Get him out!'

582
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,001
'Get him out!'

583
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:51,016
Open that stupid door!

584
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:57,028
'Ed!'

585
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,018
'Ed!'

586
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:02,022
Ed!

587
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,028
- You should've let me die.
- Hush, don't talk. Don't talk.

588
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:15,009
I thought you abandoned us.

589
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:22,006
You should've let me die.

590
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:24,009
I won't. I won't.

591
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:39,027
You trust her?

592
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,022
You trust me?

593
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:45,010
How's she gonna help us?

594
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:47,020
God will provide a way.

595
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:51,027
God? Now you believe in God?

596
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,022
'She does.'

597
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:03,002
'This is my damage report.'

598
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:05,017
'Check it over
and I'll sign it.'

599
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,022
And if anyone asks,
I was out, that's all.

600
00:41:08,024 --> 00:41:10,024
I thought you were going
to Elsie's this morning.

601
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,002
It seems to me
if we're going to hang people

602
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,012
we can at least give God an
opportunity to save their souls.

603
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:20,008
I quite agree with you. That's
why we have a prison chaplain.

604
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,009
Go home, Kate.

605
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,004
Mr. McNeil..

606
00:41:35,023 --> 00:41:38,011
All I did was read
to a few poor desperate men

607
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:40,019
and save your prison
from burning down.

608
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:42,025
'Is that so unreasonable?'

609
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,013
Alright.

610
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:49,022
But Mr. Biddle will have to
remain in solitary for a while.

611
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,025
If you and God don't object.

00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:29,014
<i>who sawed through</i>
<i>the bars on his cell.</i>

640
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>He held them in place</i>
<i>with candle wax..</i>

641
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:37,012
<i>...so no one knew.</i>

642
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,018
<i>Until he flew the coop.</i>

643
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:42,027
<i>Jack and me could do the same</i>

644
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:46,005
<i>if we had saws.</i>

645
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:51,008
<i>If you agree to this..</i>

646
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,006
<i>...hold your hand</i>
<i>over your heart</i>

647
00:43:53,008 --> 00:43:57,000
<i>wherever you are</i>
<i>and pledge to do it.</i>

648
00:43:58,016 --> 00:44:02,009
<i>Wherever I am,</i>
<i>I will hear your pledge.</i>

649
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,001

650
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:13,005

They brought you out?

652
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:52,010
Gave me a bath.

653
00:44:52,012 --> 00:44:54,022
- 'Are you alright?'
- Now I am.

654
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:02,007
I got what you wanted.

'I hope we can continue
our Bible lessons, boys.'

656

Yes, ma'am.

657
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:12,015
I'd like to start
with a selection

658

from first Corinthians
chapter XIII

00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:16,022
verses one through four.

It's in my boots.

661
00:45:22,005 --> 00:45:23,007
Come close.

662
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:31,020
Watch the door, Jack.

663
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:40,011
Read your Bible.

664
00:45:47,013 --> 00:45:49,014
Um..

665
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:52,011
"Though I speak with the tongues
of men and angels

666

No, no.

Yes.

678

- 'What are you doing?'
- Hey.

679
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:57,016
There's two oranges missing
from the larder. Eddie?

680

Clarence? Thank you very much.

'Thank you, Clarence.'

683

Let's start again at the
beginning, Margaret, alright?

684

One and two.

Sorry. One and two. Good.

697

Let's slow it down.

Push the other way. That's it.

- Can I have a try, papa?
- I know, it scared you.

705
00:49:11,018 --> 00:49:13,018
Well, it's a fast train,
isn't it?

706
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,012
- 'Can I try?'
- 'Yes, alright, in a minute.'

'Now not too fast
around the curves.'

Attaboy!

- Now, boys.

You're going to have
to share the train.

the controls.

00:55:25,016 --> 00:55:26,025
It's..

798
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:28,028
Quite fine.

799
00:55:33,016 --> 00:55:35,018
- When will Maggie be back?
- In the morning.

800
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,004
Do you know

801
00:55:49,006 --> 00:55:51,023
the other day a woman stopped me
in the street to tell me that

802
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:54,029
I was as good as a murderer.

803
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,014
As if I were
the judge, the jury

804
00:55:56,016 --> 00:55:58,010
and the executioner,
all rolled up into one.

805
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:02,023
"I just do my duty, ma'am."
I said to her.

806
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,017
Whatever the courts
and the jail board

807
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:09,009
and the governor lay down,
you see

808
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:11,005
I have to carry out.

809
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:15,010
Oh, I know those boys
are guilty and deserve to
die.

810
00:56:15,012 --> 00:56:17,015
Peter, do you think
we could go off someplace?

811
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:20,010
Away from the prison. I need
to get away for a month maybe.

812
00:56:20,012 --> 00:56:21,025
- You, you and me?
- Yes, yes.

813
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:23,001
And we could leave the children
with Elsie.

814
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,023
And we'll go off
on our own someplace.

815
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:26,015
- I don't have any, I don't...
- Please, take me someplace.

816
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:29,025
Peter, Just for a month or maybe
a few weeks and I promise you.

817
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:32,016
When we come back
I'm going to be a good mother.

818
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:34,026
I'm going to be a good wife
and I'll never get sick again.

819
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:38,013
Peter, please.
Peter, please?

820
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:42,025
Kate, I know it's a hard
life
here. I know that.

821
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:45,011
- No, it's not that.
- But it is a good position.

822
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:47,026
We won't be here forever.

823
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:51,012
If you can just be patient.

824
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:55,016
- Hmm?
- Yes.

825
00:56:58,027 --> 00:57:00,007
Yes, Peter.

826
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:46,028
'Help!'

827
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:53,014
'Help!'

828
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:55,023
'Guard!'

829
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,003
'Guard!'

830
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,004
'Wait!'

831
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:40,004
'Hey, what are you,
what are you doing?'

832
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,014
'Stop fighting
and just give me your leg.'

833
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:12,001
- Quiet night?
- Mm-hmm.

834
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:31,008
- It's a pretty picture.
- Every man should have a hobby.

835
00:59:32,024 --> 00:59:34,014
Jack!

836
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:43,019
- Get up, get up.
- 'Get him off me!'

837
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,010
He's heavy.

838
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:50,016
Come on, help me.
Push, push, push!

839
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:20,015
- No!
- You'll come with me.

840
01:00:20,017 --> 01:00:22,002
Now is your chance.
You gotta go, Ed.

841
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:23,010
With you.

842
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:28,027
'Ed?'

843
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:30,020
Ed?

844
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:33,013
Ed, we've gotta go.

845
01:00:34,015 --> 01:00:35,022
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

846
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,007
- Come with me.
- No, no.

847
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:49,026
'Ed, come on!'

848
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:51,024
Go, go.

849
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:54,009
Ed, no!

850
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,006
No.

851
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:15,007
Come with me.
Come with me.

852
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:17,005
Come with me.

853
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:45,025
Whoo!

854
01:02:21,023 --> 01:02:24,019
Jessie, aren't you coming
to work today?

855
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:28,001
No, I'm not coming in today.
Just go ahead without me.

856
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:30,003
'Alright,
we'll see you tomorrow.'

857
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:48,010
I could use a map of some kind
to plan out where we're going.

858
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:50,017
We're in good shape.
Don't you worry.

859
01:02:52,028 --> 01:02:54,021
How's she gonna travel with you?

860
01:02:54,023 --> 01:02:57,015
Look at her. Look at her shoes.

861
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:59,012
'She's just gonna
hold you back.'

862
01:02:59,014 --> 01:03:01,007
She's right, Ed.

863
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,022
Did we break out of prison
just to get caught?

864
01:03:03,024 --> 01:03:05,024
'Lost your faith in me, Jack?'

865
01:03:07,018 --> 01:03:09,027
- No.
- 'Cause that's how it sounds.

866
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:12,028
'Jack, you ought to go out on
your own and save yourself.'

867
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,016
What's the use
of getting killed over her...

868
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:16,002
Shut up, Jessie!

869
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:24,014
Thank you, sir.
We'll pay you back if we
can.

870
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:26,003
'I am proud to do it.'

871
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:29,006
'I wish I could help you
gentlemen out some more.'

872
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:38,014
I tried to see you in prison
and they wouldn't let me.

873
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:41,015
I would have done anything.

874
01:03:44,025 --> 01:03:46,018
I'm sorry, Jess.

875
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,014
Put these on.

876
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:51,023
Maybe you should abandon me.

877
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:53,023
What?

878
01:03:53,025 --> 01:03:55,017
Maybe you should abandon me.

879
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:58,012
The point was to get you free.
You and Jack.

880
01:03:58,014 --> 01:04:00,017
You wanna go back?

881
01:04:00,019 --> 01:04:02,000
I don't know.

882
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:04,017
Right about now my children
are gonna know that I'm gone.

883
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:06,009
If you want to go back,
I'll take you back.

884
01:04:06,011 --> 01:04:07,020
- Whatever you want.
- Jessie is right.

885
01:04:07,022 --> 01:04:09,024
How can you travel with me?
I'm so stupid.

886
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:12,008
Why'd you come with us
if you don't know?

887
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:13,029
'Look at her.
You're gonna go with her?'

888
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:16,023
Look at what she's done.
You know what she's done.

889
01:04:16,025 --> 01:04:19,025
- No, I want my babies.
- Ed, let her go.

890
01:04:19,027 --> 01:04:22,002
- Let me out!
- Babies? You want your babies?

891
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:25,012
Shut up.
Will you shut up? God.

892
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

893
01:04:28,006 --> 01:04:30,009
- I'm so sorry.
- God!

894
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,004
Are we going or ain't we?

895
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:46,000
Excuse me!

896
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,014
'Excuse me, please.'

897
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:51,028
'Ed was vicious.'

898
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,023
'He clubbed me, how many times
was it, George?'

899
01:04:53,025 --> 01:04:55,023
'Maybe 15, 20 times?'

900
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:57,005
'And I don't understand it.'

901
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:59,023
No, sir, I don't, I don't,
I can imagine..

902
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:07,010
Buck! Buck!
The Biddles can't stay caught.

903
01:05:07,012 --> 01:05:09,016
Looks like you're
going after them a second time.

904
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:11,010
It'll be the last time,
believe me.

905
01:05:36,013 --> 01:05:38,000
"Edward and John Biddle

Has your wife been located,

Sir, what has she got
to do with it?

918

My wife, uh, Mrs. Soffel,

Yeah, we must be coming
into Perrysville.

If we get separated,
we'll have to meet there.

925
01:07:03,007 --> 01:07:04,009
Yeah!

926
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:06,025
- Now, remember what I told you.
- Yes.

927
01:07:06,027 --> 01:07:09,009
- What?
- Push out, away from the train.

928
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:11,016
I'll be right there
to catch you.

929
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,027
Come on.

930
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:24,006
Alright, Kate.
Come on.

931
01:07:24,008 --> 01:07:25,014
Alright, just a minute.

932
01:07:25,016 --> 01:07:29,000
Alright, ma'am.
Now you've just gotta jump.

933
01:07:29,002 --> 01:07:30,010
Come on.

934
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,015
Alright, Jack.
You go ahead. You go first.

935
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:36,008
Kate! Now, Kate!

936
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,012
Now! Now!

937
01:07:40,016 --> 01:07:41,020
Kate!

938
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:42,029
'Now, ma'am.'

939
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:46,013
'Oh, mother of Christ!
Go ahead, jump. Go on.'

940
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:47,024
Jump!

941
01:07:47,026 --> 01:07:49,011
Go ahead. Ready?

942
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:55,016

944
01:08:41,003 --> 01:08:42,012
- Oh!
- Miss?

945
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:44,016
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you were my husband.

946
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:46,017
- Oh! Oh!
- It's me.

947
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:48,025
Scared her by accident.

948
01:08:48,027 --> 01:08:51,022
My wife. My wife.
We just got married today.

949
01:08:51,024 --> 01:08:53,021
'Oh! Well..

950
01:08:53,023 --> 01:08:56,017
...it don't serve you to lose
your man the day you marry him.

951
01:08:56,019 --> 01:08:58,028
New brides tend to be skittish.
You take care of her now.

952
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,008
'Yes, sir. You bet I will.'

953
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,029
Good luck,
and a happy New Year to you.

954
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:04,010
Thanks!

955
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:10,008
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

956
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:19,018
Well, happy New Year!

957
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:26,001
Hey, Jack, would you care
to kiss the bride?

958
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:29,000
Jack!

959
01:09:31,015 --> 01:09:32,018
For Christ's sake,
why don't you just go tell

960
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:35,019
the whole countryside
we're here?

961
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:36,029
Read this.

962
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,020
They're paying $5000
to the man who kills us.

963
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:46,016
We just won't let anyone collect
that reward, will we, Ed?

964
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,013
Oh!

965
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:08,015
Oh.

966
01:10:11,022 --> 01:10:13,026
Better get those boots off.

967
01:10:17,016 --> 01:10:18,017
Yeah!

968
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:22,010
'See if we could build
a little fire?'

969
01:10:22,012 --> 01:10:23,023
'It's so cold.'

970
01:10:23,025 --> 01:10:27,011
We've only been on the road
a couple of hours.

971
01:10:27,013 --> 01:10:30,009
I saw a coal bin
out the back.

972
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:32,016
Think you could get some
coal?

973
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:42,011
Jack.
Jack, you listening to me?

974
01:10:42,013 --> 01:10:44,022
Maybe you just ought to try
listening to me for a change!

975
01:10:54,003 --> 01:10:55,009
What?

976
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:01,024
Don't you think
you better take that off?

977
01:11:07,002 --> 01:11:10,016
I've worn it 18 years.

978
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:12,009
Come on!

979
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:50,018
Oh, my God!

980
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,023
"John and Edward Biddle
under the sentence of death

981
01:11:52,025 --> 01:11:54,023
"escaped from the county jail
this morning

982
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:57,007
"under most sensational
circumstances.

983
01:11:57,009 --> 01:11:58,016
"They're believed
to have been assisted

984
01:11:58,018 --> 01:12:01,004
by the wife of Warden Peter,
Kate Soffel."

985
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:02,019
Oh, my God!

986
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,003
It's so exciting!

987
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:06,007
"With whom they made off
during the night.

988
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:09,006
"It is believed
Mrs. Soffel is now alone

989
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:10,029
"for criminals as desperate
as the Biddles

990
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:13,010
will certainly not burden
themselves with a woman."

991
01:12:15,003 --> 01:12:19,000
'I hope Mama's not alone.
I hope she is with the
Biddles.'

992
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:21,009
No, you don't, Margaret.

993
01:12:21,011 --> 01:12:24,018
Don't you know what this means
if she's with them?

994
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,017
She can never come home again.

995
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:29,007
Papa won't allow it.

996
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:31,019
Not if she's with
that Ed Biddle right now.

997
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:33,024
'That's not true!'

998
01:12:35,014 --> 01:12:38,001
I hope they've killed mama.

999
01:12:40,009 --> 01:12:41,016
I hope she's dead.

1000
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:58,012
'Kate?'

1001
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:10,004
I wasn't sure if it was going
to be you or the police.

1002
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:12,010
Did you think I'd desert
you?

1003
01:13:13,012 --> 01:13:15,003
I wasn't sure.

1004
01:13:16,013 --> 01:13:18,018
I spent most of my life
in prison, Kate.

1005
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,025
And, uh, sometimes, I just..

1006
01:13:22,013 --> 01:13:24,008
...forget how to act
with people.

1007
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,017
Well, you're not
in prison now, Ed.

1008
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:41,014
Coming with us?

1009
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,003
Oh, Ed!

1010
01:14:06,002 --> 01:14:07,015
All aboard!

1011
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:15,023
- Let's hurry.
- Hurry where?

1012
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:19,013
- Yes, where?
- North, to Canada.

1013
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,001
Giddyup!

1014
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,010
Tickets.

1015
01:15:03,021 --> 01:15:05,010
'Tickets, please.'

1016
01:15:19,021 --> 01:15:21,025
Easy!

1017
01:16:40,023 --> 01:16:41,024
No!

1018
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,007
He came out of nowhere!

1019
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:49,007
Jack, you go
and hitch up the horses.

1020
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:52,008
Ed, see if he's hurt.
Only be careful!

1021
01:17:00,023 --> 01:17:02,014
Sit down. Easy.

1022
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,005
'How is he?'

1023
01:17:05,007 --> 01:17:07,017
I know you.

1024
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:09,007
He's fine!

1025
01:17:09,009 --> 01:17:11,022
You go wait in the sledge
with Jack!

1026
01:17:11,024 --> 01:17:13,028
I'll be right there, Kate.
Go on!

1027
01:17:19,005 --> 01:17:21,018
You trailed us
from Perrysville, huh?

1028
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,005
Yes, sir.
I borrowed a horse.

1029
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,019
You know who I am?

1030
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:31,013
Biddle.

1031
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:32,028
You tell anyone you saw us?

1032
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,018
- No, sir. Not a soul.
- Sure?

1033
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,025
Yes, sir.
The Pittsburgh police, they..

1034
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:44,026
God!

1035
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,006
You can't ever beat it, can you?

1036
01:18:02,006 --> 01:18:03,007
'What?'

1037
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:08,012
Nothing. I'm sorry.

1038
01:18:08,014 --> 01:18:11,020
- It's alright.
- You got a smoke?

1039
01:18:20,014 --> 01:18:22,012
Mind if I take one
for my brother?

1040
01:18:22,014 --> 01:18:25,017
- 'No.'
- Thank you.

1041
01:18:29,003 --> 01:18:31,006
You wanted to catch us?
For the money?

1042
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:36,003
Well, money, and to be the man
who got the Biddles.

1043
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:44,000
Look..

1044
01:18:44,002 --> 01:18:45,024
...I'm gonna knock you out.

1045
01:18:45,026 --> 01:18:48,019
'But don't make any noise
like you're hurt or nothing.'

1046
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:50,020
'Don't make a sound,
do you understand?'

1047
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,025
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

1048
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:55,011
Now don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

1049
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:02,007
- You out?
- Almost.

1050
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:05,018
Hang on, I'll try again.

1051
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:34,007
We're safe.

1052
01:19:34,009 --> 01:19:36,021
He didn't tell anybody
he saw us.

1053
01:19:36,023 --> 01:19:37,027
Let's go.

1054
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:40,003
Giddyup there!

1055
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:54,001
Bless and keep these men,
Father, in the righteousness

1056
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:55,027
of their mission to hunt
down
the killers of innocent
men...

1057
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:58,012
Amen, reverend! That's enough.

1058
01:19:58,014 --> 01:20:00,019
Get your guns and ammunition,
men!

1059
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,027
- Sheriff Hoon!
- Aah, what do these women want?

1060
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:07,003
They want to ride
with the posse

1061
01:20:07,005 --> 01:20:08,016
to make sure no one hurts
the Biddles.

1062
01:20:08,018 --> 01:20:11,024
You get out of here!
Get back home where you belong!

1063
01:20:54,004 --> 01:20:55,028
'Pardon me, sir.'

1064
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,003
Oh, hello there. You lost?

1065
01:20:58,005 --> 01:21:01,003
Oh, no, sir. I'm traveling with
my wife and my brother here.

1066
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:04,010
And, uh, if you could spare us
some blankets or some food

1067
01:21:04,012 --> 01:21:06,015
'I'll buy 'em from you.'

1068
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:14,018
You better get that woman
in the house right away.

1069
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,003
'Yes, sir.'

1070
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,008
'You've got no business
taking your wife out'

1071
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:24,020
on a day like today.

1072
01:21:24,022 --> 01:21:28,005
Well, we got relatives
expecting us up north now.

1073
01:21:28,007 --> 01:21:29,028
'Got an uncle in Erie.
He's awful sick.'

1074
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,029
- 'Erie?'
- 'Yes, sir.'

1075
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:34,019
'You've got a good piece of
travelling to get to Erie.'

1076
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:36,000
About how far, sir?

1077
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:38,001
Well, we're due west of Butler.

1078
01:21:38,003 --> 01:21:42,022
And I'd say it's 100 miles
from Butler to Erie.

1079
01:21:43,017 --> 01:21:45,011
Here she comes now!

1080
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:47,018
- How you feeling?
- 'Better.'

1081
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:52,020
Uh, it's beautiful here,
isn't it?

1082
01:21:52,022 --> 01:21:55,001
'But maybe we should hurry,
Ed.'

1083
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:56,016
There's no rush.

1084
01:21:56,018 --> 01:21:58,024
'That dress fits, don't it?'

1085
01:21:58,026 --> 01:22:01,011
- 'You better keep it.'
- Oh, no. I couldn't, really.

1086
01:22:01,013 --> 01:22:03,027
'It belonged
to my oldest girl Charlotte'

1087
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:05,001
when she was young.

1088
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,016
Now she's had five babies

1089
01:22:06,018 --> 01:22:08,027
and she's big as a barn.

1090
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,012
Keep it.

1091
01:22:10,014 --> 01:22:14,011
'And you're welcome to stay
as long as you're able.'

1092
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:17,002
I, uh, put a fire
in the back bedroom upstairs.

1093
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:19,021
You can go up there
and lie down.

1094
01:22:19,023 --> 01:22:21,028
'Have a rest.'

1095
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,003
It's up to my brother.

1096
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:31,007
Well, I suppose
we all could use a rest.

1097
01:22:31,009 --> 01:22:33,028
- Good!
- Thank you very much.

1098
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,010
You're welcome, dear.

1099
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:36,016
Thank you.

1100
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,004
Thank you, John.

1101
01:22:41,005 --> 01:22:44,005
Ooh, uh, would you like
to read the paper?

1102
01:22:44,007 --> 01:22:48,012
Mr. Stevenson don't seem
to read no more.

1103
01:22:48,014 --> 01:22:51,026
Our grandnephew, Harry,
reads to him sometimes.

1104
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:53,028
So you ain't read the news
the last couple of days?

1105
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,008
'No. Harry ain't been over.'

1106
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,027
- Oh, I'll read it to you.
- 'Would you?'

1107
01:22:59,029 --> 01:23:01,010
- Yeah.
- 'Oh, thanks!'

1108
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:05,009
'How late is it?'

1109
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:07,016
I don't know the time.

1110
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:09,017
'Past noon?'

1111
01:23:09,019 --> 01:23:11,005
Possibly.

1112
01:23:13,009 --> 01:23:16,004
You know one thing I never did?

1113
01:23:16,006 --> 01:23:18,011
- That is smoke a pipe.
- 'Me neither.'

1114
01:23:20,011 --> 01:23:22,008
Maybe if I would had
some kind of regular life

1115
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,002
I'd have smoked one.

1116
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,009
- How does it look?
- Fine.

1117
01:23:29,001 --> 01:23:32,007
Well, maybe I'll smoke one
when we get our farm, huh?

1118
01:23:35,022 --> 01:23:37,023
Come keep me warm, Ed.

1119
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:40,001
It's like
the snow's inside my skin.

1120
01:23:49,004 --> 01:23:50,013
You know something
I'd tell my children

1121
01:23:50,015 --> 01:23:52,025
if they ever felt scared?

1122
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,017
- I am not scared.
- No, I know.

1123
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,009
Of course you're not.

1124
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:59,020
What would you tell your kids?
Mm? Something sweet, I bet.

1125
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,011
I'd say..

1126
01:24:04,013 --> 01:24:07,004
Do you wanna hear it?

1127
01:24:07,006 --> 01:24:10,014
I'd say, "Look up at the
sky..

1128
01:24:10,016 --> 01:24:14,011
"...day or night, 'cause
in the sky you can see the sun.

1129
01:24:15,027 --> 01:24:19,016
"And at night, you can see
the moon and the stars.

1130
01:24:20,015 --> 01:24:22,018
"And these are God's eyes..

1131
01:24:23,026 --> 01:24:27,003
"...proof that
he's always above you.

1132
01:24:27,005 --> 01:24:30,023
Watching over you,
protecting you."

1133
01:24:34,013 --> 01:24:37,026
- And they'd believe that?
- I did.

1134
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:42,006
I suppose God won't protect
me
anymore, will he, Ed?

1135
01:24:44,003 --> 01:24:45,005
'Cause of me?

1136
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:46,024
No.

1137
01:24:46,026 --> 01:24:48,017
'Cause of me.

1138
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:52,007
We'll protect each other,
alright?

1139
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,018
Alright.

1140
01:24:57,023 --> 01:24:59,027
Put your hands on me, Ed.

1141
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:02,021
I'm so cold.

1142
01:25:04,007 --> 01:25:05,022
...Ed.

1143
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,013
Make my heart warm.

1144
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:58,022
'I didn't see anybody
I didn't know only.'

1145
01:25:58,024 --> 01:26:00,023
You generally notice
when people come by the store?

1146
01:26:00,025 --> 01:26:02,002
'I certainly do.'

1147
01:26:02,004 --> 01:26:03,021
We're looking for two men
and a woman.

1148
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:05,016
The two men in their mid
20s,
and the woman, 35...

1149
01:26:05,018 --> 01:26:08,012
'Oh-oh-oh, now-now-now,
wait-wait a minute now.'

1150
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:10,017
'I think I did see them.'

1151
01:26:10,019 --> 01:26:12,029
- 'When was this?'
- 'Oh-oh, earlier this
morning.'

1152
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,020
- 'Driving a sled?'
- 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, they was.'

1153
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:17,015
'Could you tell
how old they were?'

1154
01:26:17,017 --> 01:26:19,014
'Well, the fellows
was all bundled up.'

1155
01:26:19,016 --> 01:26:22,007
'Pretty hard to tell.
She must've been, oh..'

1156
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:24,012
'...oh, 30, 35 maybe.'

1157
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:27,017
- 'Driving two horses?'
- 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cutters.'

1158
01:26:27,019 --> 01:26:29,021
'Did you see which direction
they were going?'

1159
01:27:33,018 --> 01:27:35,002
Kate?

1160
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:42,011
All those things
they said I did.

1161
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:43,028
'What?'

1162
01:27:45,004 --> 01:27:48,000
- Mu.. The murder.
- 'Ssh-ssh..'

1163
01:27:48,002 --> 01:27:49,021
What they're gonna hang me
and Jack for.

1164
01:27:49,023 --> 01:27:51,026
'No, Ed, don't talk.'

1165
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:56,008
Kate?

1166
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,025
How do you prove
you love someone?

1167
01:28:03,005 --> 01:28:04,018
Prove it?

1168
01:28:09,002 --> 01:28:12,022
If there was some way that
they could get you away from me.

1169
01:28:12,024 --> 01:28:14,028
- Uh..
- If they get us?

1170
01:28:16,003 --> 01:28:18,005
- Yeah.
- Will they?

1171
01:28:20,009 --> 01:28:22,015
There's one thing
that you have to know.

1172
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:31,005
Jack never killed anybody.

1173
01:28:37,005 --> 01:28:39,008
That's why I have to die.

1174
01:28:52,015 --> 01:28:54,026
God abandoned us.
You said that.

1175
01:28:57,006 --> 01:28:58,008
Yes.

1176
01:29:01,001 --> 01:29:04,007
So if you'll forgive me..

1177
01:29:04,009 --> 01:29:06,025
...it'll be alright.

1178
01:29:06,027 --> 01:29:08,013
Ed.

1179
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:10,016
I forgive you, Ed.

1180
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:18,023
Don't you let them
take me alive, Ed.

1181
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:20,024
Promise me.

1182
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:22,022
Promise me, Ed.

1183
01:29:24,021 --> 01:29:25,020
I won't.

1184
01:29:25,022 --> 01:29:27,022
I won't. I promise I won't.

1185
01:29:27,024 --> 01:29:30,003
I won't let them
take you from me.

1186
01:30:07,024 --> 01:30:10,002
The police is out, aunt!

1187
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,000
The police is out!

1188
01:30:12,002 --> 01:30:15,024
Harry, we had company
for dinner.

1189
01:30:15,026 --> 01:30:18,026
Mr. Wright and his brother

1190
01:30:18,028 --> 01:30:21,020
and his sweet wife.

1191
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:22,026
Poor thing!

1192
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:24,016
Aunt, that was the Biddles!

1193
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:26,001
'What Biddles?'

1194
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:28,011
The killers the police
are looking for.

1195
01:30:28,013 --> 01:30:30,019
'I bet you gave dinner
to the Biddles.'

1196
01:30:32,024 --> 01:30:34,016
They are here yet, Harry!

1197
01:30:34,018 --> 01:30:36,014
Still!

1198
01:30:36,028 --> 01:30:37,028
Oh!

1199
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:41,007
Oh!

1200
01:30:41,009 --> 01:30:42,009
Ssh.

1201
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:58,011
You a Biddle?

1202
01:30:58,013 --> 01:31:00,012
The police is looking for
you.

1203
01:31:00,014 --> 01:31:02,008
Oh, Mr. Watson!

1204
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:04,020
Call the officers back!

1205
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,008
We gotta go.

1206
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:15,023
Get me the Prospect police!

1207
01:31:15,025 --> 01:31:18,012
Yes, ma'am, the police!

1208
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:21,014
My poor husband's
in that house with them.

1209
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:25,006
You men take some guns

1210
01:31:25,008 --> 01:31:27,007
and go in after those boys!

1211
01:31:27,009 --> 01:31:28,028
You go yourself,
Mrs. Stevenson.

1212
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,017
I ain't getting killed!

1213
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:33,010
Here they come.

1214
01:31:35,014 --> 01:31:37,027
- Alright?
- Yeah.

1215
01:31:47,006 --> 01:31:49,002
Move! Get back!

1216
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:55,028
Did you see that?
You better stand back!

1217
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,009
We're two desperate fugitives,
and she's ruthless and insane.

1218
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:02,021
There's nobody..

1219
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:09,025
Sorry, mister, and thanks a lot.

1220
01:32:09,027 --> 01:32:12,019
Goodbye! And good luck
to you young folks!

1221
01:32:12,021 --> 01:32:14,025
- So long.
- Bye. Bye.

1222
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:18,002
Hyah!

1223
01:32:20,027 --> 01:32:22,003
Bye!

1224
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:25,026
Hyah! Giddyup!

1225
01:32:39,018 --> 01:32:42,008
I didn't hear no shot, Buck.

1226
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:49,016
Turn them around, John.

1227
01:32:49,018 --> 01:32:52,006
- What? Back the way we came?
- Now.

1228
01:33:03,029 --> 01:33:05,017
Hey, Ed?

1229
01:33:05,019 --> 01:33:06,022
'Yeah.'

1230
01:33:06,024 --> 01:33:09,025
They got bears in Canada?

1231
01:33:09,027 --> 01:33:12,014
I don't know, I suppose they do.
Do they, Kate?

1232
01:33:12,016 --> 01:33:14,007
Oh, I imagine so.

1233
01:33:14,009 --> 01:33:16,021
- What about polar bears?
- Yes.

1234
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:18,028
I'd give anything
to see a polar bear.

1235
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:35,028
Ed. Ed!
Look over there!

1236
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:40,028
Uh, heck, Ed, what do I do?

1237
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,013
Just keep on driving, Jack.

1238
01:33:42,015 --> 01:33:44,002
'Giddyup, there!'

1239
01:33:44,004 --> 01:33:46,018
'Hyah! Hyah!'

1240
01:33:47,009 --> 01:33:48,017
'Hyah!'

1241
01:33:51,002 --> 01:33:53,010
Hyah! Huh!

1242
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,023
Hyah! Hyah!

1243
01:33:59,013 --> 01:34:00,012
'Hyah! Hyah!'

1244
01:34:06,005 --> 01:34:07,008
Hyah!

1245
01:34:32,001 --> 01:34:33,020
Hyah! Hyah!

1246
01:34:57,027 --> 01:35:00,004
Ed! Oh, no. Ed.

1247
01:35:00,006 --> 01:35:01,010
Jesus!

1248
01:35:01,012 --> 01:35:03,005
Ed? Ed?

1249
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:10,005
Tell me what to do, Kate.

1250
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,025
I want you
to keep your promise, Ed.

1251
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:18,023
I can't go back.

1252
01:35:18,025 --> 01:35:22,005
Ed, I want you to do it.

1253
01:35:23,006 --> 01:35:24,024
Do it, Ed.

1254
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:31,003
You know I love you,
don't you, Kate?

1255
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:33,004
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1256
01:35:34,007 --> 01:35:35,008
Say you love me.

1257
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:36,024
Say you love me too.

1258
01:35:36,026 --> 01:35:38,021
- I do.
- Huh.

1259
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:40,022
I love you.

1260
01:35:48,026 --> 01:35:51,026
I, I...I never meant
to hurt you, Kate.

1261
01:35:54,022 --> 01:35:57,005
Yes! Yes!

1262
01:36:08,023 --> 01:36:11,007
Hyah. Hyah!

1263
01:36:15,008 --> 01:36:17,021
Hyah!

1264
01:36:17,023 --> 01:36:18,021
Hyah-ah!

1265
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:20,008
They're coming straight for us.

1266
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:22,023
Hyah-ah!

1267
01:36:22,025 --> 01:36:24,010
Hold 'em steady, John.

1268
01:36:24,012 --> 01:36:26,013
Hyah! Go! Go!

1269
01:36:27,025 --> 01:36:30,016
Hyah-ah!

1270
01:36:34,012 --> 01:36:37,008
Ed! Come on. Get up.
Get up.

1271
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:38,012
Huh.

1272
01:36:39,023 --> 01:36:41,027
Turn those horses out!

1273
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:20,022
'Hold your fire!'

1274
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:22,029
Hold your fire!

1275
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,015
Hold it!

1276
01:37:24,017 --> 01:37:26,007
'Hold it!'

1277
01:37:43,017 --> 01:37:46,000
Jack. Jack?

1278
01:37:47,011 --> 01:37:48,014
Ed?

1279
01:37:50,024 --> 01:37:51,025
Ed?

1280
01:37:54,011 --> 01:37:56,008
I'm sorry.

1281
01:37:57,022 --> 01:37:59,008
'I'm sorry, Jack.'

1282
01:38:04,018 --> 01:38:07,004
Let me die.
Let me die.

1283
01:38:11,023 --> 01:38:14,004
Leave 'em be, Buck.

1284
01:38:14,006 --> 01:38:16,010
They can't hurt nobody no more.

1285
01:39:43,026 --> 01:39:45,029
Holy God in heaven!

1286
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:49,013
It's the woman!

1287
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:51,018
She's been shot,
but she's alive!

1288
01:42:33,015 --> 01:42:36,014
'There's someone here for you,
Mrs. Soffel.'

1289
01:42:36,016 --> 01:42:39,013
I don't wanna see
that preacher.

1290
01:42:39,015 --> 01:42:41,002
I don't need his prayers.

1291
01:42:41,004 --> 01:42:43,008
It's not the preacher.

1292
01:42:50,019 --> 01:42:51,020
Oh.

1293
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:54,009
Oh.

1294
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:59,014
Papa doesn't know I'm here.

1295
01:43:00,014 --> 01:43:02,006
Billy brought me.

1296
01:43:04,006 --> 01:43:06,002
I look so awful.

1297
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,025
Oh, Irene,
do you hate me?

1298
01:43:11,029 --> 01:43:13,019
Well, don't you have
a brush or..

1299
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:16,027
They won't give me one.
I'm so dangerous.

1300
01:43:28,008 --> 01:43:31,019
Bill, Billy and I got married,
mama.

1301
01:43:31,021 --> 01:43:33,025
- Mm-hm.
- I wanted to tell you.

1302
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,004
Oh.

1303
01:43:40,016 --> 01:43:41,017
Oh.

1304
01:43:44,005 --> 01:43:46,005
'Your change.'

1305
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:53,000
'Ice cream.'

1306
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:55,006
'Ice cream!'

1307
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:02,006
'Ice cream!'

1308
01:44:02,008 --> 01:44:03,019
Oh, Becky, can I have some?

1309
01:44:14,014 --> 01:44:16,006
- There she is.
- There she is.

1310
01:44:16,008 --> 01:44:17,012
There she is.

1311
01:44:32,007 --> 01:44:34,009
Mrs. Soffel.

1312
01:44:46,028 --> 01:44:48,010
Good morning, Mrs. Soffel.

1313
01:44:48,012 --> 01:44:51,002
Let me introduce
the superintendent of prisons

1314
01:44:51,004 --> 01:44:53,001
Mr. Coates.

1315
01:44:53,003 --> 01:44:56,005
And the district attorney
Mr. Robinson.

1316
01:44:56,007 --> 01:44:57,023
You know, ma'am

1317
01:44:57,025 --> 01:45:00,006
you once ruined
an important program of mine.

1318
01:45:00,008 --> 01:45:03,020
'I had a pass to see
the Biddles hang last winter.'

1319
01:45:03,022 --> 01:45:05,027
'I was really
looking forward to it.'

1320
01:45:16,015 --> 01:45:18,016
I'm ready to go in now.

1321
01:46:21,007 --> 01:46:23,012
Well, at least
it's not as cold now.

1322
01:46:26,021 --> 01:46:29,025
Spring has come early this year.

1323
01:46:29,027 --> 01:46:32,013
Last year we had to wait
a long time for spring.

1324
01:46:32,015 --> 01:46:33,024
Remember?

1325
01:46:33,026 --> 01:46:35,008
No.

1326
01:46:39,007 --> 01:46:41,008
I was sick last spring.

1327
01:46:49,007 --> 01:46:50,014
Well..

1328
01:46:51,027 --> 01:46:54,004
...I hope you'll be comfortable
while you're here.

1329
01:47:00,004 --> 01:47:01,013
Agnes..

1330
01:47:03,008 --> 01:47:05,004
...thank you.

1331
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,021
