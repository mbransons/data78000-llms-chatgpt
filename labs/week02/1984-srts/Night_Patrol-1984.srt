171
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,883
Fine, except I'm a little late.

172
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,364
Yes, you're late with your
appointment for Captain Lewis,

173
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:13,251
but it's okay.

174
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,517
I covered for you.

175
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,475
Oh, thanks.

176
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:17,045
I told him you slept in.

177
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:18,471
Is Captain Lewis upset?

178
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:19,348
No.

179
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:20,182
Good.

180
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,519
He's furious.

181
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,266
Maybe I should come
back when he's not busy.

182
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,364
Oh, no, no, no!

183
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,093
I told him I'd send you in
as soon as you got here.

184
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,513
But it's okay, his bark is
a lot worse than his bite.

185
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,178
Here, you can finish
the rest of this, okay?

186
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,012
Okay.

187
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,440
I've been hearing that you
tell people that I tell lies!

188
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:40,952
Oh, you heard wrong, sir.

189
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,021
I heard what wrong?

190
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,968
That what you heard about me
telling people you tell lies,

191
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,005
you heard wrong.

192
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,641
What I heard about people
telling lies you heard wrong?

193
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:47,600
What?

194
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:48,551
Well, what you heard

195
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:50,499
about me telling people you
tell lies you heard wrong, sir!

196
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,363
That's why you're getting a promotion.

197
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,681
You mean I'll be getting

198
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:55,195
that desk job I've been wanting, sir?

199
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,335
Even better, even better.

200
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,609
You're gonna be getting night patrol.

201
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,144
Night patrol, sir?

202
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,575
And with it you get a car
and a partner and a raise.

203
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,324
A car, a partner, and a raise, sir?

204
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,656
I said you get a car and a partner.

205
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,506
I didn't say anything
about a raise, did I?

206
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,572
No, sir, nothing about
a raise, nothing sir!

207
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,139
Now I want you to meet your new partner.

208
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,752
He's from a new precinct.

209
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:21,067
Miss Perman, is Kent Lane here yet?

210
00:11:21,068 --> 00:11:22,539
Yes, he is sir!

211
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,844
Yes he is sir, what?

212
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,265
Yes, he is sir, sir!

213
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,233
Good.

214
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,798
Send him in!

215
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,106
Patrolman Kent Lane reporting, sir.

216
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:37,580
Oh, I see you met Miss Perman.

217
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:40,250
Yes, Sue Perman and I
are old friends, aren't we?

218
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:42,275
Yes, I've known you since
you were a clerk, Kent.

219
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,759
Well, I'm your Captain Lewis, Lane

220
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,700
and this is your new
partner, Melvin White.

221
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:47,938
How do you do?

222
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,757
And has Sue already made
out our schedules, sir?

223
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:53,375
No, no, but she will plan it daily.

224
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:57,024
Yes, I will and, sir, will
you be holding inspection

225
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,336
this evening, sir?

226
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,278
Nah, nah.

227
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,217
I don't want anymore of that crap tonight.

228
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,003
Sir, please don't use those words.

229
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,185
Crap tonight?

230
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,706
What's the matter, Sue Perman?

231
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,315
My language a little too rough for you?

232
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:14,058
Crap tonight, crap tonight!

233
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,678
Sir, those words make
me feel weak and helpless.

234
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,078
Alright, I want you two go
and get a good night's sleep

235
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,695
and be back here for
inspection at six o'clock.

236
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,460
The inspection is generally
at five o'clock, sir.

237
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,224
Are you calling me a liar too?

238
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,325
No, then inspection will be at six.

239
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,022
No, I said the inspection
is at five o'clock!

240
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:35,590
Now, dismissed!

241
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:36,996
So inspection's at six, sir?

242
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:37,988
Right!

243
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,234
You'll never guess
what happened to me, Sue.

244
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,601
You got a promotion, fancy new partner,

245
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:45,435
and you got a car.

246
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:46,953
How did you know?

247
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:49,032
Let's just say a little bird told me.

248
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,615
But he didn't get a raise.

249
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,034
Aw, no raise!

250
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:55,901
That's too bad.

251
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,778
But you know, Melvin,
the way you treat people

252
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,412
with love and respect...

253
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,752
What I was really
hoping for was a desk job

254
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:02,796
that would keep my evenings free.

255
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,685
What's the matter that you
don't wanna work at night?

256
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,995
You're not moonlighting, are ya?

257
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,738
Somebody moonlighting?

258
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,032
No, no, Captain!

259
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,155
Are you calling me a liar?

260
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,689
No, sir!

261
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,899
You see I'm working on
this novel about police work

262
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,419
and I work much better in the evenings.

263
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,937
You see, I went to night school.

264
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,624
Melvin, I hope that you finish it

265
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,523
'cause you're such a wonderful human being

266
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,462
and a sincere person.

267
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,500
You know, you're either
a fool or you're stupid.

268
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,332
That girl back there really likes you.

269
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,379
Sue likes me?

270
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,445
I don't think so.

271
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,447
Sure she does.

272
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,031
It's written all over her face.

273
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:35,744
I notice that whenever she's around you,

274
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,367
can't keep her eyes off you.

275
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,949
Not even to look at me,
which is incredible.

276
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,412
For a while I though she
was some sort of a dyke.

277
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,041
You know what you ought to do?

278
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,160
You ought to jump on officer Judy.

279
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,698
Officer Judy, you mean with...

280
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,560
Yeah, I was with her all last night.

281
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,471
Oh yeah?

282
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:53,308
Fucked her brains out.

283
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,589
Here she comes now.

284
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,618
Hi, Judy!

285
00:13:58,619 --> 00:13:59,584
It's gonna be okay.

286
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,688
It's gonna be alright.

287
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,101
You don't have a thing to worry about.

288
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,432
I've got new evidence.

289
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,113
We're gonna get you a new trial.

290
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,457
I'm gonna get you a new deal.

291
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,776
Judge is a friend of mine.

292
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:11,512
Meantime, if you get the
chance, try to escape.

293
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:12,430
Let's go!

294
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:17,436
Alright, you guys,
prepare for inspection!

295
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:18,270
Attention!

296
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,790
Alright, officers.

297
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,645
I want to clean up this city.

298
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,479
Prostitution is running rampant.

299
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,782
And I want to drive every
hooker out of this town.

300
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,714
Now, I want you to be extra
careful for the next 24 hours

301
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,273
because I'm leaving town

302
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:48,107
and I'm going to a police
convention in Las Vegas.

303
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,655
Officers seven and nine?

304
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,552
Yes, sir!

305
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:54,037
Take the Hollywood area.

306
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:54,870
Yes, sir!

307
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:55,703
Officers three and five?

308
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:56,536
Yes, sir!

309
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:57,369
Chinatown.

310
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,203
Yes, sir!

311
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,347
Officers two and six?

312
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,696
Yes, sir!

313
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:01,544
The beach.

314
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,779
Yes, sir!

315
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,502
And officers four and one?

316
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,841
Officers four and one?

317
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:09,857
Always want to go there, I
don't like it there anymore.

318
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,970
Are you one?

319
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,151
Ooh, yes, I'm one.

320
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,128
Are you one too?

321
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:16,847
Well, if you're one,
then you must be four.

322
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:18,485
I'm for whatever he's for.

323
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:19,881
Thank you!

324
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,605
Alright, you guys take the park.

325
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,795
Ooh, that means we
get to wear our dresses!

326
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,178
I'll wear my Bob Mackie.

327
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,416
You would!

328
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,179
And don't wear your chiffon

329
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,839
because it just doesn't match your eyes.

330
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,959
He's right.

331
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,026
And be sure you catch
the purse snatcher.

332
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,096
Ooh, we almost caught him in
a park just the other night.

333
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,508
But he gave us the slip.

334
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:41,107
And then we followed
him all the way downtown.

335
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,698
And again he gave us the slip!

336
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:43,907
That's right.

337
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:44,809
He gave me a blue slip.

338
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,910
What color was your slip?

339
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,987
Mine was chartreuse.

340
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,353
Ooh, take my breath away!

341
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,852
Dismissed!

342
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,683
Now go get 'em tigers!

346
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,133
Okay, Melvin, I want
you to cover for me.

347
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:15,730
Wait, so any chance of
you lettin' me go out there

348
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,843
and you cover for me?

349
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:18,910
Are you crazy?

350
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,972
You're just a rookie.

351
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:23,698
I've been doing night
patrol now for ten years.

352
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,214
Just keep your eyes peeled.

353
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,463
But I'll be a rookie all my life

354
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:27,482
unless you give me a chance!

355
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:28,611
Now, look, I know I can do it.

356
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,945
You gotta trust me, please!

357
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,050
Just this one time.

358
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:32,514
Okay.

359
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,581
Great, you won't be sorry.

360
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:34,543
I swear!

361
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,610
Be careful.

362
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:36,444
I will.

363
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,357
You'll be proud of me, okay?

364
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,713
Before I go, let me
get that straight now.

365
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,320
That's two jelly doughnuts,
one glazed, two coffees,

366
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,004
one cream, one without sugar, right?

367
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:50,837
Right.

368
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:51,671
Right!

369
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,153
The rough part of town.

370
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,950
Yeah, well you're not kidding.

371
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,446
Look at that over there!

372
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,697
You gotta pull over.

373
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:00,698
What for?

374
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:01,780
What for?

375
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:03,945
That guy's parked in
front of a fire hydrant.

376
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:04,863
Oh, yeah.

377
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,842
You don't mind me handling this, do ya?

378
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:15,808
Just be firm.

379
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,975
Okay, great.

380
00:17:29,731 --> 00:17:31,713
Now what are you doing in there?

381
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:32,828
Necking!

382
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:34,583
Yeah, well you're
going to have to put your neck

383
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,896
back in your pants and go somewhere else.

384
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,899
Why do you take a fuckin' hike!

385
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,994
Kent, he won't move the truck.

386
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:52,758
Alright, I'll take care of him.

387
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,345
Come on, you.

388
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,179
Get out of there!

389
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,784
I want you to move that truck now.

390
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:10,625
I mean now!

391
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,784
I said right now!

392
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:15,618
I'll move, I'll move, I'm going!

393
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,471
Shit, look out!

394
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:40,945
Oh, shit, comin' back again now!

395
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,013
Get back!

396
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,606
We need some reinforcements!

397
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,757
Hey, Bubba, hit 'im with the tear gas!

398
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,040
Code six, code six!

399
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,907
This is car 86 requesting a back-up unit

400
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,810
as soon as possible.

401
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,758
Let's back into this now!

402
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,537
Where is he?

403
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,128
We've got you completely surrounded.

404
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,699
Drop your weapon!

405
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,097
Oh my god, he's got a kid!

406
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:47,518
Drop 'im!

407
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,833
Aww, you shot the kid!

408
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,027
Now look what you made me do, you idiot!

409
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,733
You made me hit an innocent bystander!

410
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,566
If I was to blame, I
would admit it, okay.

411
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,984
It's no big deal!

412
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,363
Get out of here, shoo!

413
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:25,105
Go ahead, go find your own neighborhood.

414
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:27,886
Thank you.

415
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:32,630
Hey, Melvin, when you
took over when I slipped

416
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,177
and I fell under the car there like that.

417
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,541
Thank you, Kent.

418
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,530
Thank you.

419
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:38,535
Melvin, you said he was funny, huh?

420
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,817
How can a bag be funny?

421
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:42,507
Alright, here's a quick
impression of the first man

422
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,010
to land on the sun.

423
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,512
Ooh, shit!

424
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:53,103
Just a second, my socks are coming down.

425
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:05,262
Yes, you're a police
officer during the day,

426
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,644
but at night you put this bag on your head

427
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,104
and tell jokes in nightclubs

428
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,546
because you enjoy making
people laugh, is that right?

429
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:12,835
Right.

430
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,305
You needed a disguise because

431
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,117
as a police officer you'd lose your job

432
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:18,320
if they found out you were
moonlighting, is that right?

433
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:19,530
Uh huh.

434
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:21,980
Don't you think this
is kind of a cop out?

435
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,345
Hey, that's kind of a good joke.

436
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,060
You could use that in your act.

437
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,319
I'm so confused.

438
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,564
I can't decide whether to quit
show business or police work.

439
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:32,529
And to make matters worse,
I've fallen in love.

440
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,385
I feel something when
you're here in the office too.

441
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:38,697
Chemistry I don't feel with
my other male patients.

442
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,219
No, not you, a girl.

443
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,720
She was beautiful.

444
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,826
Somehow I managed to get her attention.

445
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:49,349
God, you're beautiful!

446
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,048
I got a lot of money here.

447
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,607
I'd like to take you up to my apartment

448
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,006
and show you some of my etchings.

449
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,324
What's your name?

450
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:00,270
Edith.

451
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:01,960
Edith what?

452
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,735
Edith Hutton.

453
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,054
How about joining me for a drink?

454
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:09,035
Well, Edith Hutton says...

455
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:12,201
Fuck off!

456
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,285
Ow, ow, ow!

457
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,179
Eww!

458
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,915
My balls!

459
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,749
My balls!

460
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:52,369
My tits are numb too.

461
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,226
A message from Miss Parker.

462
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:55,817
Thank you.

463
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:07,309
How ya doin?

464
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,259
I caught your act, kid.

465
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,221
I think you're great!

466
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,542
Listen, my name is Kate Parker.

467
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,827
I'd like to handle you
'cause I think you've got

468
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:13,264
what it takes to go all the way.

469
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:14,263
You do?

470
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:15,590
All you have to do is listen to me.

471
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:16,816
Some of the biggest comedians
in the business listen to me.

472
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:17,811
Ever hear of Don Rickles?

473
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:18,644
No.

474
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:19,477
He listened to me.

475
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:20,310
Steve Martin?

476
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,143
No.

477
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:21,976
He listened to me.

478
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:22,809
Charles Bronson?

479
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,643
I don't think so.

480
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:24,800
Well, he didn't listen to me.

481
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,486
Look, I can have you on all
the top TV talk shows in town

482
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:27,942
and have you working
in Vegas in six months.

483
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,267
How much did Tex pay you?

484
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,593
He gave me a thousand.

485
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:32,459
Come on, kid.

486
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,761
He gave you 25 and you're good

487
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,688
so he offered you 35 for next time, right?

488
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:36,747
How did you know?

489
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,289
It's my business to know.

490
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,888
Hey, Tex, come here!

491
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:40,970
Hi, Tex.

492
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,654
Yeah, Kate.

493
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,688
Listen, sweetie, I think
this kid is super talented

494
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,355
so I'm gonna be bringing a lot of people.

495
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:47,662
They'll be drinkin' a lot of your booze.

496
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,246
So how about paying
him 50 bucks next time?

497
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,286
Anything for you, babe.

498
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,148
Thanks, Kate!

499
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,731
You know me, Tony Baroni?

500
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,996
Look, I'm lookin' for a manager, you know?

501
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:03,497
Your acts sucks, get beered.

502
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,784
Maybe you didn't see the face.

503
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:08,179
That's what it must be right?

504
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,013
Go away!

505
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:12,267
Anyway, stick with me, kid,

506
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,008
and I'll have ya wearin' a Gucci bag.

507
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:16,298
Can you believe it, Doc?

508
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,122
I met a gorgeous girl named
Edith and a manager named Kate,

509
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,960
who wants to make me a star.

510
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,019
What do you think will happen next?

511
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,187
I predict that you will
have your Kate and Edith too.

512
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:33,040
Ahh, yourself!

513
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:37,197
I have another very important prediction.

514
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:38,047
Oh yeah?

515
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:39,395
What is it Doc?

516
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:43,969
I'm sorry your time's up.

517
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,551
Calling all
cars, calling all cars.

518
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,857
Be on the lookout for anything suspicious.

519
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:51,040
I'd say we're in for
a rough night tonight.

520
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,262
Yeah, why?

521
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:55,013
Well, look there's a full moon.

522
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,583
This is the
toughest part of town.

523
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,667
We have gangs, pimps porno
shops, X-rated movies.

524
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:10,747
Just keep your eyes open
for anything suspicious.

525
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:11,586
Help!

526
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:12,420
Help!

527
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:13,739
Somebody help me!

528
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,772
You ever seen an X-rated movie?

529
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,123
I went one time.

530
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,172
It was really disgusting, though.

531
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:22,093
Finally left after about 8 hours.

532
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:25,120
Besides the screen was
beginning to irritate my nose.

533
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:32,457
Oh, Kent, remember when Captain Lewis

534
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,179
said he was gonna drive all
the prostitutes out of town?

535
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,343
Yeah.

536
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,011
Well, there he is!

537
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,044
And he's driving
a whole bunch of them

538
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:43,506
out of town right now!

539
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,538
Car 86, robbery in progress

540
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,060
at Sampson Bar and Grill, 155
Johnson Street, code three.

541
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:52,155
Ten four.

542
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:54,163
Okay, let's go, let's go!

543
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:56,027
Let's get out of here.

544
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,195
Nobody here.

545
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm gonna go talk to the owner.

546
00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:07,258
You check for witnesses.

547
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:08,092
Okay.

548
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:14,160
Oh, Kent, I think I killed
an innocent bystander.

549
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:16,010
It's alright, calm down.

550
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,869
Just tell us what happened.

551
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:24,099
He must have gotten away
with over two thousand dollars.

552
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,531
Tuesday night's our big night
with choir practice next door.

553
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:28,998
Any description?

554
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,697
Write this down, Melvin.

555
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:32,781
That's no problem.

556
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:36,949
He was wearing a tan jacket,
brown pants, and judo shoes.

557
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:43,207
Any distinguishing features
like a tattoo, mustache?

558
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,960
A zit, cold sore?

559
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:47,579
Oh yeah, there was one more thing.

560
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,081
He was wearing a bag over his head.

561
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,598
Bag over his head.

562
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,183
Yeah, except he had
two holes for his eyes

563
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:03,351
and one hole for his mouth
and he kept telling jokes!

564
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,503
Jokes!

565
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,272
What kind of jokes?

566
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:09,691
How do you get a witch pregnant?

567
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,678
I don't know, how do
you make a witch pregnant?

568
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,929
You fuck her.

569
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:15,181
That's not funny.

570
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,289
I know.

571
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,624
Yes, it is.

572
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,136
Maybe it is, Doc.

573
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,809
Someone's setting me up.

574
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,055
Can you believe it?

575
00:27:23,056 --> 00:27:25,997
Somebody's robbing bars
with a bag on his head.

576
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:29,287
The police are gonna think it's me.

577
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:31,300
Do you think your
family didn't like you?

578
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,337
Yes.

579
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,476
When I was a kid, my
mother used to scream at me

580
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,651
because I used to wet the bed.

581
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,554
Well, tomorrow night's your big chance.

582
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,650
And a lot of big bookers will be there.

583
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:43,028
I hope they won't be hard on me.

584
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:47,569
So Julia Child has the show on PBS?

585
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,432
This guy sucks!

586
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,195
Thank you, thank you.

587
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:54,529
It's been swell knowing you.

588
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:57,836
Her PBS show get cancelled.

589
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,154
Hey, you got five minutes, kid!

590
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,319
No pressure.

591
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,453
I mean it, I promise.

592
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:05,551
No pressure, I really believe in you.

593
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:07,752
No pressure, don't be nervous.

594
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,148
I have about a million
butterflies in my stomach.

595
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:11,531
Here, take these.

596
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,002
Mmm, What are they?

597
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,195
Mothballs.

598
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:17,321
Boy, your career is really on the rise.

599
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,719
We're gonna get into
bumper stickers and posters

600
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,828
and T-shirts, everything!

601
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,438
After tonight, kid,

602
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,749
you're gonna be the most
known unknown comic.

603
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,943
Ooh, you really think so, Kate?

604
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,693
Guess who?

605
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,862
I don't believe this guy!

606
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:40,702
He's nuts.

607
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,536
He follows me around all
the time, auditioning for me

608
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:43,907
and he can't do anything right!

609
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,537
He's a real no talent.

610
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,391
I also do Ed Sullivan!

611
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,283
Hey, we got a great fuckin'
show for you to see tonight.

612
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:54,170
What do you think of that?

613
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:57,555
Great audience tonight.

614
00:28:57,556 --> 00:29:01,223
Remember to continue
to be a great audience.

615
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:04,216
We have a new comedian coming up.

616
00:29:04,217 --> 00:29:06,155
I'm sure you're all gonna love him.

617
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,225
Thank you, once again.

618
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:11,170
Please welcome the Unknown Comic!

619
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:16,989
Alright, what a crowd!

620
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,071
What an audience!

621
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,111
Woo hoo!

622
00:29:19,112 --> 00:29:21,351
Okay, I'm telling you, I
just flew in from Las Vegas.

623
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:24,874
What a bummer, I got airsick
and nobody knew!

624
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,449
Yeah, got me staying
at the Sahara hotel.

625
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,661
What a weird hotel!

626
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:30,478
I call the desk clerk tell
him I got a leak in my sink.

627
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,859
He said go ahead.

628
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,517
Yeah, things have been
pretty good, though.

629
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,428
I just moved into an
apartment over a bank,

630
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,912
which is great 'cause now my ass sets

631
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:41,500
over ten million dollars!

632
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:44,150
Boy, you people have amazing control!

633
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,536
Yeah, I got a joke for you

634
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,701
that's gonna make your boobies fall off.

635
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,569
Oh, you already heard it.

636
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:52,478
I'm just kidding.

637
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,307
Actually, I can make
your boobies seem larger.

638
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:55,993
I have small hands.

639
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,027
What do you call a nurse
with dirt on her knees?

640
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:00,515
A head nurse.

641
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:03,760
Why does a dog lick his groin?

642
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,257
'Cause he can!

643
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,504
Why is pubic hair curly?

644
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,456
'Cause it doesn't poke your eyes out.

645
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:16,707
What do you call a
hundred cows masterbating?

646
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:17,995
Beef stroganoff!

647
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:23,329
One more, what has three balls
and comes from outer space?

648
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,187
E.T., the extra testicle!

649
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,395
You know why they spell sex S-E-X?

650
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:31,784
'Cause you can't spell.

651
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:36,392
Did you hear about the guy
who had herpes in his eyebrows?

652
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:38,703
The guy was lookin' for love
in all the wrong places!

653
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:50,976
What's his schedule?

654
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:56,023
I'll pay whatever you want!

655
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,691
How 'bout a little head later?

656
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:01,823
Un, I'm made a tape of tonight's show.

657
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,416
I want you to listen to it.

658
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,027
You know, it could be very helpful.

659
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:06,925
By the way, kid, you were great tonight!

660
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:08,264
They were all wacked out!

661
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:12,018
Oh, Kate, it felt like my first orgasm!

662
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,272
Can I have your autograph?

663
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,240
Oh, Edith, it's you!

664
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,286
I believe you owe me a drink.

665
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:19,372
Right, a drink.

666
00:31:19,373 --> 00:31:21,718
I owe her a drink, Kate.

667
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,516
Listen, I've got some big deals to make.

668
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:24,693
I'll talk to you later.

669
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:26,766
By the way, just remember
love comes and goes,

670
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,597
but herpes last forever.

671
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,051
Hey, wait a moment!

672
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,214
Bartender, one beer
and two glasses, okay?

673
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:35,046
And make sure my glass is clean.

674
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,681
You know, beer makes you smarter?

675
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:37,542
Really?

676
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:38,912
It made Bud wiser.

677
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,259
Alright, which one of you
two ordered the clean glass?

678
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,470
I did.

679
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:43,485
Here.

680
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,153
I like my beer in a glass too.

681
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:49,217
I've got a cucumber I'd like to show you.

682
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,479
I have a bag of tricks
I'd like to show you myself.

683
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,954
Ooh, my motor's running!

684
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:53,872
Oh really?

685
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:55,135
Let's go to my place

686
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,263
and I'll put anchovies and
cream cheese on your body

687
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:58,238
and lick it off.

688
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,512
I can't right now.

689
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:00,536
Okay just anchovies.

690
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:02,163
Well, you see I'm sort of with someone.

691
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:03,273
He might just pop up.

692
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:05,323
I'm popping up right now.

693
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,954
And I would love you to clamp your teeth

694
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:08,551
on my zipper and pull it down.

695
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,665
I can't, really I have to go.

696
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,394
What about your phone number?

697
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:13,645
Are you into phone sex?

698
00:32:13,646 --> 00:32:14,810
I don't have a phone.

699
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:16,530
Can I drive you home?

700
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:17,815
My car's right outside.

701
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,150
What about a kiss?

702
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,082
Lock your lips on my love muscle.

703
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,003
And don't forget me!

704
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,773
I'll never forget you, uh uh...

705
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:35,607
Edith!

706
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:37,713
Edith, right, Edith.

707
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:39,105
Bartender, write that down.

708
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:40,106
E-D-E-E-T-H.

709
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:46,007
Oh, I guess you guys heard

710
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,712
that the bag man robbed another bar today!

711
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:49,326
Boy, Captain Lewis is really determined

712
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:50,940
to find out who did it.

713
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:53,662
Oh, he's no more determined
than I am, believe me.

714
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:56,004
Oh, Melvin, Captain Lewis
also received a report

715
00:32:56,005 --> 00:32:57,704
that there's an unknown comedian

716
00:32:57,705 --> 00:32:59,211
who wears a bag on his
head, who's gonna be playing

717
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:01,777
at the Magic and Comedy Club this weekend.

718
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:05,945
He's gonna send out a detail
to investigate the suspect.

719
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,180
Do you think there's any
chance that you can work it out

720
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:12,181
so Kent and I can go on that detail?

721
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:14,518
It's in the bag.

722
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,144
The bag man robbed another bar!

723
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,853
The Meat Market Saloon on Powell Street!

724
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:20,647
Now get Kent and get over there right now!

725
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,631
Yes, sir!

726
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,937
Kent, you better finish
filing those reports later,

727
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:24,470
we gotta go!

728
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:26,003
The Meat Market Saloon on Powell Street!

729
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,269
Yes sir, yes sir!

730
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,415
Hey what's going on?

731
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,431
Bag man robbed another
bar over on Powell street.

732
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,168
No, no, Meat Market
Saloon's on Mounthill.

733
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:34,635
Why did the Captain say
it's on Powell street?

734
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:37,231
He was lying.

735
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,373
Is somebody calling me a liar?

736
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:40,957
No, no, no!

737
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:49,824
Meat Market Saloon, huh?

738
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:53,108
This must be a country and western bar.

739
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:56,776
I don't think so.

740
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:58,286
Your face or mine?

741
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,561
Your face.

742
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:00,979
Ow, not so rough!

743
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:06,388
Hey, it's about time you pigs got here!

744
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:07,483
Calm down now,

745
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:09,732
nobody gets anything done
when they're excited.

746
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:12,700
Who are you telling not to get excited?

747
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,211
Back off, back off!

748
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:17,770
He just get excited when
he sees beautiful women.

749
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,944
Who runs this place anyway?

750
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:25,185
I own the bar and if we
catch that sucker who robbed us

751
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:28,606
we're gonna turn that bag
inside out, pluck his eyes out,

752
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:31,371
stab him, shoot him, and then
tear him into little pieces

753
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,598
and then see how funny he is.

754
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,282
How much money did he get?

755
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,514
Money's not important.

756
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:38,385
All he got was a lousy 50 bucks!

757
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:41,051
It was the jokes that he told.

758
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:42,295
What jokes?

759
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:43,670
Well he asked us

760
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:47,838
if our favorite TV program
was The Dyke Van Dick show.

761
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:52,951
Pretty funny.

762
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:54,369
Not that funny.

763
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,553
Uh-oh.

764
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,580
No, that is a bad joke.

765
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,619
That bad guy better hope

766
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,823
that you get him before we
get him 'cause if we get him

767
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:10,864
we're gonna rip his dick off!

768
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:12,885
And then we're gonna bounce
his balls on the ground

769
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:14,284
so hard that they land on the moon

770
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,389
and feed what's left to the goldfish.

771
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,390
Now get out!

772
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,412
I love it when they dominate.

773
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,047
A tough place huh?

774
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:26,651
Tough, wanna see tough?

775
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:28,326
See that pool table over there?

776
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,160
Yeah.

777
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:31,418
Got no balls.

778
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:41,370
Boy those were some pretty
scary gu... girls weren't they?

779
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:43,627
You know that call gave me a real boner.

780
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:44,786
A what?

781
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:47,068
Boner, you know, boner.

782
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:48,486
What's a boner?

783
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,214
Well it's a...

784
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:56,360
Well, it's a, like a fish,
you know you debone a fish.

785
00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,084
Oh, speaking of boners, I'm starved.

786
00:35:58,085 --> 00:35:59,980
What do you say we get something to eat?

787
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,019
We can't eat now,

788
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,063
we got about ten more
minutes on this shift.

789
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,662
Here why don't you just
finish off this chocolate bar.

790
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,008
You don't mind?

791
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:08,259
No, go ahead.

792
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,791
Hey, Kent, haven't seen you for a while.

793
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,023
Why haven't you called?

794
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,434
Babe, I been a little busy.

795
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:19,185
I'll give you a call, don't worry.

796
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:20,692
I'm gonna go wash my fingers.

797
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:22,223
I got chocolate all over them.

798
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,156
I'll join you.

799
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:24,492
Gotta drain my lizard.

800
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:25,325
What?

801
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,158
My lizard.

802
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,035
What's that?

803
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:28,692
It's like a horned toad.

804
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:34,381
See this machine here,
sells these little rubbers,

805
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,992
says for the prevention of disease.

806
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,760
Don't believe it, I wore
one for three weeks.

807
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:38,761
I got mumps.

808
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:44,230
Oh no, I got water all
over the front of my pants!

809
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:45,825
Use the blow dryer over there.

810
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:48,791
I can't go out there like this.

811
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,792
Give me a hand, will ya?

812
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,834
We better get out of here
before we get arrested.

813
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,010
Some menus.

814
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:14,844
Okay.

815
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,975
What'll you have?

816
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,058
How much is coffee?

817
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:21,374
Thirty cents.

818
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,377
Okay, a refill.

819
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:23,739
Refills are free.

820
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,811
Okay, give me a refill
and a slice of garlic cake.

821
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,792
Okay, and you?

822
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,594
I think I'm gonna have
the steak dinner, okay.

823
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:32,559
Soup or salad?

824
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,058
What kind of soup you got?

825
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,106
Cream of washroom.

826
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:36,678
Cream of washroom sounds good.

827
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,711
I'll have that.

828
00:37:37,712 --> 00:37:39,161
How you want your steak?

829
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:42,079
As Ronald Reagan would say, well!

830
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,037
Kent!

831
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,873
Thanks so much for last night.

832
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,531
You were marvelous!

833
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:53,365
Wow!

834
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:59,478
Listen, Melvin, we been
partners for two weeks now, right?

835
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:00,665
Yeah.

836
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,427
And I think if we're
gonna work together,

837
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:04,111
we ought to know each other.

838
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:05,123
Sure.

839
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:06,699
I got tons of girlfriends.

840
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,393
You got a lot of girlfriends?

841
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:09,561
Girls, uh...

842
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:11,897
You like girls don't you?

843
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,410
Well, yeah, of course I do!

844
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:14,720
I mean who doesn't.

845
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:15,638
Name one.

846
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,546
Well, Edith Hutton.

847
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:22,287
Edith Hutton?

848
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:24,189
You know her?

849
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,552
Know her, the entire navy know her!

850
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:27,528
Well, that's nice.

851
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,489
I didn't know she was so patriotic.

852
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,816
Look, when the FBI
looks for fingerprints,

853
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:34,344
first place they check is her body.

854
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,747
No kidding!

855
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:42,414
Well, what kind of
girls you usually like?

856
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:44,970
I like girls that are interested
in the same things I am.

857
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:46,423
Like what?

858
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,830
Booze and cheap sex.

859
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:52,905
Let me tell you something, Melvin.

860
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:56,297
If you're gonna get
married, marry an ugly girl.

861
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:58,024
Ugly girl, why?

862
00:38:58,025 --> 00:38:59,878
You marry a pretty one,

863
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,936
two weeks later she runs
off with somebody else.

864
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:05,501
Well, an ugly girl can run away too.

865
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:08,085
I know, but who gives a shit.

866
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,345
What's your cum doing on my steak?

867
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:14,745
I didn't want to drop it again.

868
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,975
Look at this, I can't,
this is a dirty knife.

869
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:17,844
Let's see.

870
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,325
What about my soup?

871
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:25,089
Oh yeah, soup, shit!

872
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:30,615
Wow, can you believe this place?

873
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:31,743
I believe it.

874
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,497
Look here in my coffee, there's a roach.

875
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,642
Hey busboy, look here!

876
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,424
There's a roach in my coffee.

877
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:40,392
Oh, that's where it went.

878
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:42,243
Wow, hey thanks man!

879
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:46,620
Here's your soup.

880
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:49,234
What's your thumb doing on my soup?

881
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:50,793
Got an infection on my thumb.

882
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:52,833
My doctor told me to keep it warm.

883
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:55,123
Why don't you take it and
shove that thumb up your ass?

884
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,548
I do that when I'm back in the kitchen.

885
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:02,278
It's not bad.

886
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:06,655
Calling car 86, car 86 come in.

887
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,185
Yeah, car 86 reporting.

888
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,385
Car 86 go to
alley, back of Blair avenue.

889
00:40:10,386 --> 00:40:12,294
There's a rape victim in need of help.

890
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:14,500
Respond, code 69.

891
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:17,001
Roger, we'll be right there.

892
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,683
What the hell, no tip?

893
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,463
Oh, I'm sorry.

894
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:35,528
There she is, Kent!

895
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,674
Don't worry, dear,
everything's gonna be alright.

896
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:39,560
We're the police.

897
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,216
Yo!

898
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:42,050
Sorry!

899
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:45,454
Oh officers, it was horrible!

900
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:47,812
There were three of them
and they wouldn't stop.

901
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,534
Three of them, what
were they gang members?

902
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,066
No, they were women.

903
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:54,641
But they had these guns
and whips and chains.

904
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,101
What did they make you do?

905
00:40:56,102 --> 00:41:01,094
Well, first they made me
pull out my, pull out my...

906
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,800
Well, you know.

907
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,028
Your pee-pee?

908
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:04,862
Uh-huh.

909
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,232
And then they made me play with it

910
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,066
and pull on it until I, until I...

911
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,931
You know.

912
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:14,766
Arrived.

913
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,157
Climaxed.

914
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:19,219
That's all they did?

915
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,321
Is that all?

916
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,655
They made me do it 13 times!

917
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:26,018
Thirteen times, that's terrible!

918
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:29,002
The first couple of
times were fine, but...

919
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:32,256
Oh my god, I can't even walk anymore!

920
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,116
Strangest rape case I ever heard of.

921
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,881
You recognize any of them?

922
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,888
No I couldn't see a thing.

923
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,954
What do you mean you
couldn't see anything?

924
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,978
Well, see I had been
drinking a little bit early on

925
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:45,099
and I thought I would just come out here

926
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,404
and sort of sleep things off,

927
00:41:46,405 --> 00:41:50,077
but the light from the lamppost
kept getting in my eyes,

928
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:52,305
so I just kind of put this
paper bag over my head.

929
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,545
Meat Market Saloon.

930
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:03,043
I would like to start off by handing out

931
00:42:03,044 --> 00:42:04,978
some autographed eight by
ten pictures of myself.

932
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:06,452
Here we go, alright.

933
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,088
Also, got some pictures of me as a baby!

934
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:11,361
Here we go!

935
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,973
Stop the show, stop the show!

936
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:15,624
This man's the father of my baby!

937
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,329
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, baby.

938
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,367
You can't prove that!

939
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:19,833
Oh, yeah!

940
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:52,245
Sue, well hi!

941
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:54,002
What are you doing here?

942
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:55,647
Well, I came to see the show.

943
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:57,820
Wasn't the Unknown Comic great?

944
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,111
Oh yeah, he was good.

945
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:00,561
Very good, yeah he was.

946
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:02,464
Melvin, I didn't see you anywhere.

947
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:03,944
Where were you?

948
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:05,072
I was back there.

949
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:06,418
I was all around the club,

950
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,741
but then I had to come
out here and patrol also.

951
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:10,653
Melvin, do you think that
maybe the Unknown Comic

952
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,765
and the bag man are
maybe one and the same?

953
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,330
No, in fact I'm sure they're not

954
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,185
because I had a long talk
with the Unknown Comic

955
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:19,336
before his show and he
can account for every one

956
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:21,801
of his whereabouts during
the time of the robberies.

957
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:23,530
Oh, good!

958
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:25,118
Melvin, I was gonna have a cup of coffee.

959
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,530
You want to maybe come with me?

960
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:30,493
I'd love to Sue, but
it's a, I'm still on duty

961
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:32,243
and I have to find Kent,

962
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:33,795
but sometime we'll get together,

963
00:43:33,796 --> 00:43:36,867
me and you and we'll do our laundry, okay?

964
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:38,207
Okay.

965
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:40,212
Alright, I'll see ya.

966
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:41,374
Bye, Melvin.

967
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,208
Bye!

968
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:44,945
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

969
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:47,364
Oh, Melvin, listen great show tonight!

970
00:43:47,365 --> 00:43:48,380
Great, great!

971
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,421
Listen, I got three new club bookings

972
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,436
and then something
really big in the works.

973
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:53,924
Melvin, you're gonna
have to quit your job.

974
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,274
You're gonna be a big star.

975
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:56,628
Here's a tape of tonight's show.

976
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:58,090
Listen to it when you
get a chance, alright?

977
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:01,007
Why thanks, Kate, what
happened to your face?

978
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:02,164
That idiot, Baroni.

979
00:44:02,165 --> 00:44:04,328
He can't do anything right, nothing!

980
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:05,162
Sorry.

981
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:09,138
Kate, how did you know
I was the Unknown Comic?

982
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:11,509
It's my business to know my
clients, you know what I mean?

983
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,343
See ya around.

984
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:13,814
Bye!

985
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:15,927
Hey, remember me, Toni Baroni?

986
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,224
You wanted a bag?

987
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:18,463
Here, so I got a bag.

988
00:44:18,464 --> 00:44:20,390
You want jokes, I'll
give ya fucking jokes.

989
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,173
Why'd the monkey fall from the tree?

990
00:44:22,174 --> 00:44:23,831
He was fucking dead, right?

991
00:44:23,832 --> 00:44:24,847
I got all kinds.

992
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:26,636
What do you call a short stick?

993
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,988
Why do you want from me already?

994
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,095
You guys didn't see another
police officer around did ya?

995
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,837
No, I haven't seen any.

996
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,670
Kent, come on!

997
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:35,504
Let's go!

998
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:38,310
Kent!

999
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,051
Where the hell could he be?

1000
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,525
Hi, Melvin.

1001
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:52,109
I was just taking a little nap.

1002
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,308
Yeah, just taking a nap.

1003
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:02,220
That's it.

1004
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:03,615
Napping.

1005
00:45:03,616 --> 00:45:04,449
Me too.

1006
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:10,850
How can anyone take a nap
with all this funny noise?

1007
00:45:14,824 --> 00:45:17,731
So you were a big hit at
the Comedy and Magic club?

1008
00:45:17,732 --> 00:45:19,707
Now your manager has so
many things happening,

1009
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,648
you can give up your job.

1010
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,428
You're gonna make a pile of money.

1011
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:28,128
And you'll move into Beverly Hills.

1012
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:30,991
Anyplace is better than
the back seat of my car.

1013
00:45:30,992 --> 00:45:32,613
It wasn't that great.

1014
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:34,348
Edith didn't show.

1015
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:36,265
And you'll never guess what happened.

1016
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,012
You found out Edith's allergic to paper.

1017
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,673
No, after the show we got this call

1018
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:42,821
to investigate a peeping tom.

1019
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:46,035
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

1020
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:47,984
So we snuck up on the culprit

1021
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:51,630
and beat the crap out of the fat slob.

1022
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:55,798
You see, us police are
expertly trained in kung fu.

1023
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:57,689
Hee ya!

1024
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:17,620
Anything you say can and
will be held against you.

1025
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:21,036
Liz Taylor, Michael
Jackson, Richard Simmons.

1026
00:46:21,037 --> 00:46:22,026
Shit!

1027
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:24,416
How about Boy George?

1028
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,654
Go check on the girl.

1029
00:46:25,655 --> 00:46:27,154
I'll take care of this guy.

1030
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:28,703
Are you really the police?

1031
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,375
Yes, I am.

1032
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:33,319
Okay, but you just can't be too sure.

1033
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,153
Edith!

1034
00:46:35,094 --> 00:46:36,761
Well, how did you know my name is Edith?

1035
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:37,916
We never met before.

1036
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:41,417
You see, my sister's name is Edith

1037
00:46:41,418 --> 00:46:43,668
and you reminded me of her.

1038
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:48,100
You have no idea how terrified I was.

1039
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:49,654
It was awful!

1040
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:56,197
He just kept staring at
me through that window.

1041
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:57,681
This window here.

1042
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:58,587
Yes.

1043
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,634
Did he see anything?

1044
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:02,543
He saw everything.

1045
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:05,961
Can you describe exactly what happened?

1046
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:09,338
Well, I was getting ready for bed.

1047
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,695
I was really tired.

1048
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:14,529
I started to take off my bathrobe.

1049
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,556
And then I took my stockings off.

1050
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:30,924
And then I remembered I
couldn't wait to get my bra off.

1051
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:32,425
Oh, feels so good!

1052
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:38,789
God, I have nice tits!

1053
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,415
Then I got up to take these off.

1054
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:44,357
That's when I noticed him, that pervert!

1055
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:47,993
Staring at me through the
window with those binoculars.

1056
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:50,120
Yeah, well what did he do next?

1057
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:53,358
I mean can you identify these
here as being the binoculars

1058
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,201
that the pervert was using?

1059
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:57,007
Yeah, I'm sure.

1060
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:57,841
Okay.

1061
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:00,192
Fine.

1062
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,855
God, it makes me so angry!

1063
00:48:02,856 --> 00:48:05,451
Well, you're beautiful
when you're angry.

1064
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:08,109
God, I don't understand you men.

1065
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,340
It just makes me want to puke!

1066
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:12,918
What kind of men do you like?

1067
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:15,252
Are you getting this down?

1068
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,971
Well, I'm dating a nightclub owner.

1069
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:20,997
His name is Tex.

1070
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,115
Tex?

1071
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,871
You're dating Tex?

1072
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,449
You know Tex?

1073
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,723
No, my brother's name is Tex.

1074
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:29,164
Well, he's a nice guy.

1075
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:31,462
He buys nice things, takes me nice places.

1076
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:33,630
Do you know who I'm really mad about?

1077
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:34,464
No, who?

1078
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:37,949
The Unknown Comic.

1079
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,229
He's hot!

1080
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,459
He makes me horny because
he's gonna be rich.

1081
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,966
Does he like you?

1082
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,799
Of course he does, who wouldn't?

1083
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,379
And as soon as I can figure
out what to do with Tex,

1084
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,815
The Unknown Comic will be all mine!

1085
00:48:52,816 --> 00:48:56,881
Well, does Tex know that
you know The Unknown Comic?

1086
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:58,055
Sure, he does.

1087
00:48:58,056 --> 00:49:00,342
He even bet me a diamond
bracelet I couldn't find out

1088
00:49:00,343 --> 00:49:02,329
what was under that bag.

1089
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:06,627
But I'm gonna find out what's
under that bag and that bag,

1090
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:08,961
no matter what I have to do.

1091
00:49:15,726 --> 00:49:16,970
Let go of me!

1092
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:18,463
I'm gonna kick you in the balls!

1093
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:20,118
Who do you think you're dealing with?

1094
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:20,970
Let go of me!

1095
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:21,960
I want a lawyer!

1096
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:22,942
I want him now!

1097
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,855
I've got rights!

1098
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:24,905
You don't know who I am!

1099
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:26,406
Hey, great buns!

1100
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:34,154
I'll file a report.

1101
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:35,668
You book the pervert.

1102
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:36,744
Alright, Kent.

1103
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:38,306
Hey, Melvin, what are
you bringing him in for?

1104
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:39,140
409.

1105
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:40,860
Shame on you, peeking
through windows like that!

1106
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:42,036
See anything good?

1107
00:49:42,037 --> 00:49:43,228
I've seen better.

1108
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:44,951
You wouldn't believe
what this slime did.

1109
00:49:44,952 --> 00:49:46,524
Stabbed his own mother with a BBQ fork.

1110
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,654
Then I tried to put the
cuffs on him, he socks me.

1111
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:48,940
So I booked him on a 504 and a 316.

1112
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,834
What's that?

1113
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:52,538
Cop socking and mother forking.

1114
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,313
Hey, Margowitz, what are
you bringing your guy in for?

1115
00:49:54,314 --> 00:49:55,216
604.

1116
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:56,156
What's that?

1117
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:58,034
Armed robbery.

1118
00:49:58,035 --> 00:49:58,868
Geez.

1119
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:02,219
Randy, got another cat burglar, huh?

1120
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,960
Stop or I'll shoot!

1121
00:50:13,146 --> 00:50:15,206
Why do they keep my shoelaces?

1122
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:16,934
Common procedure when you're booked.

1123
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:18,623
We don't want anyone hanging themselves.

1124
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:20,067
You're not going to put me in a cell

1125
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:23,095
with one of those hardened and
dangerous criminals are you?

1126
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:24,272
Don't worry about that.

1127
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,164
We'll find you a safe cell.

1128
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,250
Hey, what are you in here for?

1129
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:32,418
Just because I killed
myself aberrant, a degenerate!

1130
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,966
I killed three of them before they cut me.

1131
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,500
I got one and I broke his fingers

1132
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,332
and squashed his head in a vice.

1133
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,980
And the second one, I
got a three pound chicken

1134
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:46,148
and I stuffed it in his...

1135
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:50,978
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna do something!

1136
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:53,003
Maybe we better find you another cell.

1137
00:50:53,004 --> 00:50:53,837
Why?

1138
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:55,837
I like him, he was nice.

1139
00:50:57,191 --> 00:50:59,421
Alright, you guys, this
here's a peeping tom.

1140
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,230
Any of you guys object
to that sort of a crime?

1141
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:02,435
Hell, no.

1142
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,348
Looks like you needed
the excitement, huh?

1143
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:05,325
See.

1144
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:06,614
Yeah, they got me in here

1145
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,401
for having sex with a girl under 18.

1146
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:09,874
There's nothing wrong with that.

1147
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,494
Is there guys?

1148
00:51:11,495 --> 00:51:13,536
No, there's nothing like a
couple of thirteen year olds

1149
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,863
to play with.

1150
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:19,413
I'm in here for exposing
myself in the park.

1151
00:51:19,414 --> 00:51:22,424
There's nothing wrong with
that, is there fellas?

1152
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:23,457
Hell, no.

1153
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,566
You were just giving them a treat.

1154
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,422
Sounds like fun to me.

1155
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:29,613
They got me here for doing porno films.

1156
00:51:29,614 --> 00:51:32,211
Now, ya'll would like to
do porno films wouldn't ya?

1157
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:35,365
We'd all like to be free
enough to do porno films.

1158
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:37,507
Can I get his autograph?

1159
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,547
As long as you're all
letting it hang out,

1160
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:43,446
when I was a kid I'd go
to the fields, you know,

1161
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,864
and I'd make it with a sheep.

1162
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,888
Aw, man that's sick!

1163
00:51:54,096 --> 00:51:56,537
I guess everybody's done that

1164
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:58,405
at one time or another, right?

1165
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,503
Just get out, man!

1166
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:01,771
Get out of here!

1167
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:11,499
I booked you in Vegas
a week from Friday.

1168
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,992
Vegas?

1169
00:52:12,993 --> 00:52:15,671
Well, that's great, Kate!

1170
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:19,743
But wait, I still have two
weeks left on my police job.

1171
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:21,834
Now, I booked you on your day off.

1172
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:22,829
It's just a one night gig.

1173
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,508
You know, they want to see
how you do in the big room.

1174
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:25,852
They're not sure a guy with a bag

1175
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:27,915
over his head can pull it off.

1176
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,214
What do you think?

1177
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:30,942
You think we can pull it off?

1178
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:32,571
Pull it off?

1179
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:35,272
I've hired a choreographer,
conductor, singers, dancers,

1180
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:37,868
everything, I mean this is the big time!

1181
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:38,760
This is great!

1182
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:40,172
This is too good to be true!

1183
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:41,373
Thanks, Kate.

1184
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:42,467
Bye!

1185
00:52:42,468 --> 00:52:43,385
Bye, kid!

1186
00:52:47,424 --> 00:52:48,899
Melvin, is it true?

1187
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,220
Is what true?

1188
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:52,380
Captain Lewis got a phone
call earlier linking you

1189
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:53,771
with the bag man!

1190
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:56,628
I overheard him saying he was
gonna inspect your locker.

1191
00:52:56,629 --> 00:52:58,578
So I rushed over there first.

1192
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:01,276
Melvin, I found over 50 paper bags!

1193
00:53:04,136 --> 00:53:05,895
I put them in my desk.

1194
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,643
Well, that's what happened to them!

1195
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:10,338
You know, I was wondering
what happened to those bags.

1196
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:11,724
See, I've been collecting those bags

1197
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:13,524
as evidence against the bag man.

1198
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:16,484
I am this close to breaking that case.

1199
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,137
I know you're such a good person.

1200
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:20,138
You wouldn't hurt a fly.

1201
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:24,725
Well, you're a good person.

1202
00:53:24,726 --> 00:53:26,821
Of course I am and
you've got good instincts.

1203
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:28,196
You gotta believe in them.

1204
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:29,841
'Cause I am a good person.

1205
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,180
I am honest.

1206
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:32,882
I believe you.

1207
00:53:32,883 --> 00:53:34,732
You're a good guy, Sue.

1208
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:37,556
Sometime we oughta go somewhere
and just have some fun.

1209
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:38,456
Yeah?

1210
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:42,472
Yeah, maybe we could go to
my apartment and vacuum it.

1211
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:44,046
Oh, that sounds great!

1212
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:44,880
Yeah.

1213
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:46,495
Hey listen, next week is my birthday

1214
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:48,321
and I heard that the Unknown
Comic is going to be playing

1215
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:50,284
in Las Vegas so as a treat to myself

1216
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:51,409
I was gonna go down there

1217
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,636
and being that I make out your schedule,

1218
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:55,418
I know you're not working next Friday

1219
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:57,720
so maybe you'd like to join me?

1220
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:59,030
No, you see I couldn't.

1221
00:53:59,031 --> 00:54:03,237
To tell you the truth, I'm
sort of seeing someone else.

1222
00:54:03,238 --> 00:54:04,521
She's a knockout too.

1223
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:06,022
Her name is Edith.

1224
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:08,961
She's got long, blond hair, you know

1225
00:54:08,962 --> 00:54:11,840
and sometime maybe the three
of us we can go bowling.

1226
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:12,944
Who am I kidding?

1227
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:14,193
She's not the bowling type.

1228
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:16,031
She's not a buddy like you are.

1229
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:18,985
We'll get together sometime soon.

1230
00:54:18,986 --> 00:54:21,253
We'll go out somewhere
just the three of us, okay?

1231
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:22,754
I'll see ya later.

1232
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:28,146
Yes, I'm tense.

1233
00:54:28,147 --> 00:54:29,432
Of course I'm tense.

1234
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,356
Tonight's my big night in Vegas.

1235
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:33,786
I hope that bag man
doesn't rob another bar.

1236
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,576
Everybody thinks it's me.

1237
00:54:35,577 --> 00:54:37,248
I'm not even sure it's not me!

1238
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:38,727
Do you think it's me?

1239
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:40,541
Do you think I'm crazy?

1240
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,674
Am I schizophrenic?

1241
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:43,939
Help me, Doc, you gotta help me!

1242
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,440
What do you think?

1243
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:50,722
I think we came over on different ships,

1244
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:53,129
but we're in the same boat now.

1245
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:54,416
I don't understand, Doc.

1246
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,417
Never mind.

1247
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:59,464
Have a great time in Vegas.

1248
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:01,275
It's a great marquis, Kate.

1249
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:02,825
I don't believe it.

1250
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:04,403
They forgot my name.

1251
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,112
You have me to thank for everything.

1252
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:08,793
Oh, and don't forget the
party in the suite tomorrow.

1253
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:11,220
Yeah, but where's my name?

1254
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:12,768
I don't see my name up there.

1255
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:14,524
Where's my name?

1256
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:38,054
Ladies and
gentlemen, The Unknown Comic.

1257
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:47,419
Alright!

1258
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,650
Keep that applause going for the bagettes,

1259
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:51,401
ladies and gentlemen!

1260
00:55:52,614 --> 00:55:54,225
My first night in Las Vegas.

1261
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,830
Already I got 14 girls in
the sack with me, right?

1262
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,960
I'd like to introduce my
parents in the audience.

1263
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:04,560
All the way from Sacramento,
Mr. And Mrs. Bagovich.

1264
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,225
Ma and Pa Bagovich!

1265
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:09,524
And also in the audience,

1266
00:56:09,525 --> 00:56:11,311
they just flew in all
the way from Baghdad,

1267
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:13,472
my grandparents, Grandma and Grandpa.

1268
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:14,775
Stand up and take a bow.

1269
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:16,819
There they are, ladies and gentlemen.

1270
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:20,239
Grandma and Grandpa!

1271
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,659
You don't know me, do you?

1272
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,061
That's why I carry this.

1273
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:25,793
That's right, my American Express card.

1274
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:26,942
Gets me into any
restaurant in the country.

1275
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:28,384
I just go at three in the
morning after they've closed

1276
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,673
and stick it in between
the door and the lock.

1277
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:35,241
How are the new dolls?

1278
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:37,021
Terrific, absolutely terrific!

1279
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:37,916
There he is.

1280
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:38,838
You're funny.

1281
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:39,801
Oh, thanks bud.

1282
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:42,064
We had a meeting with the
board of directors this morning

1283
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,061
and I'd like to offer you
a contract with the hotel.

1284
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:46,097
You know it all started
when I was a little kid.

1285
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:47,713
I always wanted to be funny.

1286
00:56:49,013 --> 00:56:50,823
You're not making my job any easier!

1287
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,182
Why don't you go talk to the press people

1288
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:55,473
and I'll explain to Mr.
Egglash you're booked solid

1289
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:57,160
and you need a lot of money.

1290
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,077
Alright, nice meeting you Mister.

1291
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:00,701
Yes, it was nice to meet you.

1292
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:02,146
You too, bye-bye.

1293
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:03,511
Can I get an interview here?

1294
00:57:03,512 --> 00:57:04,438
Just one minute.

1295
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:05,705
You have any money on you?

1296
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:07,404
Do you have any plans to do a movie?

1297
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:10,046
Yeah, I'd love to do a porno movie.

1298
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:11,012
Hello.

1299
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:11,846
Edith!

1300
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:14,998
Well, I thought your show
was dynamite last night.

1301
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:18,949
I want you to know, I
know about you and Tex.

1302
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,671
Well, then I guess I better tell you,

1303
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:23,331
you see Tex is in deep shit with the IRS.

1304
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:25,471
He feels you're the only
one that can help him.

1305
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:27,820
He wants you to do a benefit
performance at the club.

1306
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:28,810
Yeah?

1307
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:32,541
Why don't you take that bag
off when I'm talking to you?

1308
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,912
Anyway, I've been waiting
so long for you and I

1309
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:38,246
to be together, haven't you?

1310
00:57:39,765 --> 00:57:42,025
Aren't you worried Tex
will find out about us?

1311
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:44,631
Well, he never found
out about the others.

1312
00:57:44,632 --> 00:57:45,715
Mmm, oh shit!

1313
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:49,059
Goddamn fucking glass!

1314
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,503
My dress is all wet!

1315
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:53,176
Give me a hand here will ya
before I rip your sack off!

1316
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:54,384
No.

1317
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:56,302
Make me want to puke!

1318
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:05,903
Excuse me, Mr. Unknown Comic,
I saw your show last night.

1319
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:06,816
It was really terrific.

1320
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,137
Could I get your autograph?

1321
00:58:08,138 --> 00:58:08,987
Of course.

1322
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:10,568
Excuse me, you're interrupting us!

1323
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,377
Why don't you take your
tits and ass and get lost!

1324
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:13,211
I'm sorry.

1325
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:14,867
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.

1326
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:16,193
It's okay, she's just a fan.

1327
00:58:16,194 --> 00:58:17,303
Hey!

1328
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:19,053
I thought we had something going here

1329
00:58:19,054 --> 00:58:20,820
until this dumb bitch showed up.

1330
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:21,882
Uh-oh.

1331
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:25,140
You can talk about my tits
and you can talk about my ass,

1332
00:58:25,141 --> 00:58:28,215
but don't ever call me dumb!

1333
00:58:35,722 --> 00:58:37,290
I hope you can swim.

1334
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,066
I apologize!

1335
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,567
You should be a stunt woman.

1336
00:58:46,779 --> 00:58:48,138
I'll save you?

1337
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:50,389
Get the fuck out of here!

1338
00:58:51,756 --> 00:58:54,510
You really showed her.

1339
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,182
I love that dress you're wearing.

1340
00:58:56,183 --> 00:58:57,403
Oh, that's nice.

1341
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,084
I never knew you had such big tits.

1342
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:00,666
Well, I think you're really terrific,

1343
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,104
but I have a boyfriend, although,

1344
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,922
he doesn't seem to know I exist.

1345
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:05,817
What an idiot this guy must be.

1346
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:08,793
His name is Melvin
and by the way I'm Sue.

1347
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:10,580
Do you think you can make
that out to both of us,

1348
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:11,991
Melvin and Sue?

1349
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:13,409
Melvin and Sue.

1350
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,371
I hope that you're not mad at me

1351
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:19,240
and I'm really sorry
about your girlfriend.

1352
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,106
Oh no, it's alright.

1353
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:22,508
Oh, Edith...

1354
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:24,436
Edith!

1355
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,230
Do me a favor and set
up a benefit performance

1356
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:27,546
at Tex's comedy club?

1357
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:28,462
Alright, alright!

1358
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:29,900
But I want to tell you something.

1359
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,172
The bag man just committed another robbery

1360
00:59:31,173 --> 00:59:32,366
and you're the prime suspect!

1361
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,077
That's right!

1362
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:35,164
You sure are Bag Face!

1363
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:36,397
But I assured the Captain

1364
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:38,535
that you were with me
during the robberies, okay?

1365
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:39,662
And the Captain and I

1366
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:42,611
are gonna have dinner
tonight and discuss it.

1367
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,948
So tell me, Captain, how
long have you secretly

1368
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:47,810
been the head of the FBI and the CIA?

1369
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:51,182
Calling all
cars, calling all cars.

1370
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:52,925
Be on the lookout for the bag man.

1371
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:55,502
The Captain received an anonymous tip

1372
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,272
reporting him in our precinct.

1373
00:59:57,273 --> 00:59:58,606
Be on the alert.

1374
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:02,155
For the benefit show tonight,

1375
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:04,335
you don't mind if I wait
outside again do ya?

1376
01:00:04,336 --> 01:00:05,620
No, no problem.

1377
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:06,518
Go right ahead.

1378
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,588
Great.

1379
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:09,752
Car 86, report
to 714 Conch street.

1380
01:00:09,753 --> 01:00:11,638
Transvestite disturbing the peace.

1381
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:13,101
Ten four.

1382
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:14,168
Here we go.

1383
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:25,662
Shoot me!

1384
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,016
Shoot me!

1385
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:34,923
Boy, people are really
strange this time of night.

1386
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:35,756
No, they're not!

1387
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,589
Yeah, they are.

1388
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,422
No, they're not!

1389
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:38,255
Yeah they are.

1390
01:00:38,256 --> 01:00:39,241
Not!

1391
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:41,358
Hey man, watch out for razor blades.

1392
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,080
Car 86, report
to 917 Oshgo avenue.

1393
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:46,835
Dope deal in progress, report armed.

1394
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:48,750
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

1395
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:50,929
Repeat, armed and dangerous.

1396
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:52,669
Melvin, be careful!

1397
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,003
They're armed and dangerous!

1398
01:01:09,254 --> 01:01:11,885
Alright, everybody, this is a bust!

1399
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:14,751
No, this is a bust.

1400
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:15,891
She's right.

1401
01:01:15,892 --> 01:01:17,352
What you got in your hand there?

1402
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:18,381
It's a joint!

1403
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:21,492
No, babe, this is a joint.

1404
01:01:21,493 --> 01:01:23,520
That marijuana?

1405
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:24,830
I've never tried this before.

1406
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,051
Go ahead man.

1407
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:29,302
Ooh, is that the marijuana you think?

1408
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:32,862
I don't know man, could be.

1409
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:33,946
Suck on it.

1410
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:40,443
Making me cough!

1411
01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:44,113
Feels interesting.

1412
01:01:45,339 --> 01:01:47,256
Oh, I'm horny!

1413
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:51,778
Holy cow!

1414
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:52,696
No offense.

1415
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,365
Ooh, you got a beard!

1416
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:58,904
I didn't even see the beard!

1417
01:01:58,905 --> 01:02:00,180
Did you see that!

1418
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:01,807
I've never seen it either!

1419
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:03,136
He's got no hair on his chest.

1420
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,166
I don't feel a thing,
to tell you the truth.

1421
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,000
Maybe a little hungry.

1422
01:02:07,913 --> 01:02:09,663
Oh yeah look at this!

1423
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,409
Test for a dollar!

1424
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,744
Melvin, Melvin come in!

1425
01:02:51,049 --> 01:02:52,378
Sue, come in Sue!

1426
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:53,796
Sue, one Adam 12!

1427
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:57,009
Hey these things,

1428
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,862
these razors they'll
give you a close shave.

1429
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:03,419
You want a close shave,

1430
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,728
I'll give you a close shave!

1431
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:06,373
Listen you clowns, I just
received another anonymous tip

1432
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:07,773
that the next bar to be
robbed by this bag man

1433
01:03:07,774 --> 01:03:10,493
is Leroy A Go-Go, a black
club over on Carver.

1434
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:13,223
You guys are gonna report
as undercover policemen.

1435
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:14,067
Undercover?

1436
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:15,515
Yes, undercover!

1437
01:03:15,516 --> 01:03:16,708
When do we report?

1438
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,900
Right now!

1439
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:18,906
You don't have much time!

1440
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:21,339
Ten four, ten four,
Captain and roger and out.

1441
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,233
Okay, bye!

1442
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:23,863
Yeah and one more thing,

01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:25,155
today is my birthday!

1444
01:03:25,156 --> 01:03:27,658
Oh, but Captain your
birthday was last month!

1445
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:28,998
Are you calling me a liar?

1446
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:30,931

cause any commotion.

I feel good!

I feel good tonight, feel real good.

1475

Look bad, but I feel good.

1476

Can you dig it?

1478
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:28,233
Maybe not.

1479
01:05:28,234 --> 01:05:30,870
Hey, bro, what's happening?

1480
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:33,217
I beg your pardon sir.

1481
01:05:33,218 --> 01:05:34,946
Are you speaking to me?

1482
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:36,747
Groovy place you guys got here.

1483
01:05:36,748 --> 01:05:38,124
Hey, bro how's it hanging?

1484
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,979
Hey, white man, you
ever heard of black power?

1485
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,130
Oh yeah, use it in my
kitchen get rid of those bugs,

1486
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:44,159
great stuff.

1487
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
Bartender...

1488
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,455
What'll you have, copper?

1489
01:05:49,456 --> 01:05:53,539
Give me a scotch on the
rocks and hurry please.

1490
01:05:54,504 --> 01:05:55,587
Warm in here.

1491
01:05:58,379 --> 01:06:01,718
Could I get another ice cube please?

1492
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:05,615
Maybe not.

1493
01:06:05,616 --> 01:06:07,041
I gotta go pee anyway.

1494
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:08,042
Potty, piss.

1495
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,198
Kent, I'm going to the bathroom.

1496
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:13,572
Go ahead, just watch it.

1497
01:06:13,573 --> 01:06:14,797
Right on!

1498
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,329
Hey, you live around here?

1499
01:06:19,744 --> 01:06:21,142
Hey, everybody this is a stick-up!

1500
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,302
Don't anybody move!

1501
01:06:22,303 --> 01:06:24,849
You, Buckwheat, get all
the money in this bag.

1502
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,058
Uh-uh, copper!

1503
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:28,277
Don't move that hand or I'll blow it off!

1504
01:06:28,278 --> 01:06:29,814
Come on you, move it, move it!

1505
01:06:29,815 --> 01:06:31,279
I want all the tips too!

1506
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,954
Come on, hurry up!

1507
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:34,076
Come on, four eyes!

1508
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,512
Good!

1509
01:06:35,513 --> 01:06:38,141
I've got a joke for you that
will make your hair curl.

1510
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:40,128
Ah, you already heard it.

1511
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,490
I guess the only credit card

1512
01:06:41,491 --> 01:06:43,792
this club takes is Massercharge.

1513
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:46,332
Get it, Massercharge!

1514
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:49,583
Don't worry everybody I'm the police!

1515
01:06:57,303 --> 01:06:58,918
Kent, what happened?

1516
01:06:58,919 --> 01:07:00,362
What happened, I'll
tell you what happened.

1517
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:01,679
Bag man just robbed this place.

1518
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,513
What?

1519
01:07:02,514 --> 01:07:04,012
You were in the bathroom.

1520
01:07:04,013 --> 01:07:06,581
Then the bag man leaves and
you come out of the bathroom.

1521
01:07:06,582 --> 01:07:07,926
What a coincidence!

1522
01:07:07,927 --> 01:07:09,759
Captain Lewis told me he suspected you.

1523
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,873
Let me see your neck!

1524
01:07:10,874 --> 01:07:12,229
Why?

1525
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,497
Just as I suspected.

1526
01:07:13,498 --> 01:07:14,593
What?

1527
01:07:14,594 --> 01:07:15,992
Paper cuts!

1528
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,905
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my number one suspect.

1529
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,415
What were you doing in that bathroom?

1530
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,499
Number two.

1531
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:26,747
Okay, you're my number two suspect.

1532
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,689
You two guys really
screwed it up didn't ya, huh?

1533
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,588
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

1534
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:36,413
We'll go to the Comedy Cabaret
and we're gonna find out

1535
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:38,063
once and for all, if the Unknown Comic

1536
01:07:38,064 --> 01:07:40,753
is really the bag man or if
you are the Unknown Comic

1537
01:07:40,754 --> 01:07:42,567
or if maybe the bag man is you

1538
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:44,641
or the Unknown Comic is the bag man

1539
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:46,047
or if you're not the Unknown Comic

1540
01:07:46,048 --> 01:07:47,435
and you're not the bag man

1541
01:07:47,436 --> 01:07:49,662
then we're gonna go over and find out.

1542
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,309
Come on, let me help you out.

1543
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,569
Take this, kid, go around the corner.

1544
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,108
We don't want to arouse any suspicion.

1545
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,942
Yes sir!

1546
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:14,730
Who's the owner of this place?

1547
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:15,812
I am.

1548
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:21,794
What seems to be the trouble, officer?

1549
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:23,056
No trouble at all.

1550
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,158
We're just going to find out

1551
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,960
if the Unknown Comic is really a comic.

1552
01:08:27,347 --> 01:08:28,840
Who are these two idiots?

1553
01:08:30,228 --> 01:08:31,947
We're also undercover police officers.

1554
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:34,991
I hope someone uncovers
the Unknown Comic soon.

1555
01:08:34,992 --> 01:08:38,305
It's almost showtime and
he hasn't shown up yet.

1556
01:08:38,306 --> 01:08:41,568
We want a few words
with him after the show.

1557
01:08:41,569 --> 01:08:43,193
Well, I wouldn't be too hard on him.

1558
01:08:43,194 --> 01:08:45,499
He probably has a pretty good excuse.

1559
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:49,130
It'll be very interesting to find out

1560
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:52,269
if the Unknown Comic shows up at all.

1561
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,762
Right, Melvin?

1562
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:57,171
Right, Captain.

1563
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:58,993
I gotta go to the bar and mingle.

1564
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:00,287
Let me check your doll.

1565
01:09:00,288 --> 01:09:01,716
Put me down!

1566
01:09:01,717 --> 01:09:02,927
Get out of here!

1567
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:04,624
And Melvin, you stay right there!

1568
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,694
Don't you move!

1569
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:08,962
And Tex, you keep an eye on Melvin!

1570
01:09:08,963 --> 01:09:11,444
Captain Lewis you said you
were gonna call me last night

1571
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:12,325
and you didn't.

1572
01:09:12,326 --> 01:09:13,732
Were you lying?

1573
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:17,560
If I lie to you, may the
Lord take my voice away!

1574
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:21,522
Wait a sec, drink this.

1575
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,975
Those guys sure don't
seem to trust you very much.

1576
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,897
No, they think that I know something

1577
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,467
about this Unknown Comic character.

1578
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:33,094
There's been a rumor
that the Unknown Comic

1579
01:09:33,095 --> 01:09:34,971
and this bag man that's
been robbing all the bars

1580
01:09:34,972 --> 01:09:36,376
is one and the same.

1581
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:38,342
Yeah, well I've got a
feeling neither one of them

1582
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:40,426
is gonna show up tonight.

1583
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:44,926
Hi, I know this is the night
you've all been waiting for.

1584
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:48,071
Please welcome the Unknown Comic!

1585
01:09:58,843 --> 01:10:00,535
What I'm going to do for you

1586
01:10:00,536 --> 01:10:02,116
is gonna make your boobies fall off.

1587
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:03,353
You already heard it!

1588
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:07,850
Oh, she's pissed now!

1589
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:09,578
Don't worry, I can make
your boobies seem larger.

1590
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:11,118
I have small hands.

1591
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:15,508
I'm telling you I just flew in

1592
01:10:15,509 --> 01:10:16,581
from Las Vegas.

1593
01:10:16,582 --> 01:10:17,576
Yeah, what a bummer.

1594
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:20,666
I got airsick and nobody knew!

1595
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,297
Some of you suckers are
holding in your laughs.

1596
01:10:22,298 --> 01:10:23,330
Don't do that folks.

1597
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:24,465
It creates gas.

1598
01:10:25,414 --> 01:10:26,619
That's right, everybody give me an H.

1599
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,653
H!

1600
01:10:27,654 --> 01:10:28,734
Give me an A!

1601
01:10:28,735 --> 01:10:29,567
A!

1602
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:30,400
Give me an H!

1603
01:10:30,401 --> 01:10:31,377
H!

1604
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:32,310
Give me an A!

1605
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,254
A!

1606
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,367
What's it spell?

1607
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:35,409
Haha!

1608
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,856
There don't you feel better?

1609
01:10:40,438 --> 01:10:41,561
Nobody move a muscle.

1610
01:10:41,562 --> 01:10:43,036
I swear to God, I'll blow you away!

1611
01:10:43,037 --> 01:10:44,776
You, put all the money
in this bag right now!

1612
01:10:44,777 --> 01:10:45,661
Move it!

1613
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:46,707
Now, give it to me!

1614
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,055
You've been such a good audience,

1615
01:10:48,056 --> 01:10:49,337
I'd like to leave you with a joke.

1616
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:51,695
How do you keep a roomful
of assholes in suspense?

1617
01:10:52,738 --> 01:10:54,042
I'll tell you tomorrow!

1618
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:55,691
No, darling, I've got to talk to you.

1619
01:10:55,692 --> 01:10:56,525
I love you.

1620
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:58,223
Don't you see we were meant or each other?

1621
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,478
Get away from me!

1622
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:02,312
I got the gun!

1623
01:11:02,313 --> 01:11:03,343
I got the money!

1624
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:04,177
Oh no!

1625
01:11:16,243 --> 01:11:18,160
What's going on here?

1626
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:42,304
Alright.

1627
01:11:44,563 --> 01:11:49,449
Don't you make a move or
I'll blow your brains out!

1628
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,488
I think we lost him.

1629
01:11:57,489 --> 01:11:58,989
No, there he is!

1630
01:12:01,467 --> 01:12:02,300
Come on!

1631
01:12:06,449 --> 01:12:08,366
There he is!

1632
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:09,681
I said hey!

1633
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:10,863
Hey!

1634
01:12:10,864 --> 01:12:11,840
I said ho!

1635
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:13,094
Ho!

1636
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,516
I said hey!

1637
01:12:14,517 --> 01:12:15,349
Hey!

1638
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,183
Ho!

1639
01:12:16,184 --> 01:12:17,478
Ho!

1640
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:18,683
Hey, ho!

1641

01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:09,772
I thought I saw the scumbag go this way.

1658
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:54,594
Alright, you got me.

1659
01:13:54,595 --> 01:13:56,282
You're the big man.

1660
01:13:56,283 --> 01:13:57,647
You've got the gun.

1661
01:13:57,648 --> 01:13:59,520
Go ahead, shoot me!

1662
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:01,736
Shoot me you coward!

1663
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,166
You lowlife!

1664
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,063
You scumbags!

1665
01:14:05,064 --> 01:14:06,346
Give him your gun.

1666
01:14:06,347 --> 01:14:07,554
I'm not gonna give him my gun.

1667
01:14:07,555 --> 01:14:09,222
Give him your gun!

1668
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:18,726
Who the hell do you
think you are anyway?

1669
01:14:18,727 --> 01:14:19,977
Clint Eastwood?

1670
01:14:21,134 --> 01:14:22,301
Make my night!

1671
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:26,611
Come on, quit pissing around!

1672
01:14:26,612 --> 01:14:27,945
Let's get to it!

1673
01:16:23,403 --> 01:16:24,570
Dr. Ziegler!

1674
01:16:26,554 --> 01:16:28,449
I think he's dead!

1675
01:16:29,915 --> 01:16:31,851
You could have killed me!

1676
01:16:39,202 --> 01:16:43,369
So that explains all
those anonymous phone calls.

1677
01:16:44,227 --> 01:16:45,541
Why?

1678
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:47,238
No offense, Melvin.

1679
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:48,912
Just a little bored.

1680
01:16:48,913 --> 01:16:50,535
I needed the money.

1681
01:16:50,536 --> 01:16:52,056
You two know each other?

1682
01:16:52,057 --> 01:16:52,890
Yeah.

1683
01:16:52,891 --> 01:16:55,712
But he didn't know that I
know he's the Unknown Comic.

1684
01:16:55,713 --> 01:16:58,137
Wait a minute, we just left
the Unknown Comic at the stage

1685
01:16:58,138 --> 01:16:59,820
at the Comedy Cabaret.

1686
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:02,181
If that's the Unknown Comic and I'm here

1687
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:04,682
then who the hell is that guy?

1688
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:30,045
Captain Lewis, we caught the bag man!

1689
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:31,471
Good.

1690
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:33,051
What happened to the Unknown Comic?

1691
01:17:33,052 --> 01:17:34,152
I don't know.

1692
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:35,653
Oh, there he is!

1693
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,020
Excuse me, out of my way!

1694
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:19,108
Come on, I've got you now!

1695
01:18:20,782 --> 01:18:24,949
Alright, let's see who you are!

1696
01:18:33,995 --> 01:18:35,204
Sue!

1697
01:18:35,205 --> 01:18:36,038
Melvin.

1698
01:18:36,913 --> 01:18:38,503
But why?

1699
01:18:38,504 --> 01:18:40,627
No one else is trying to help you.

1700
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:42,926
When I heard that Captain
Lewis was gonna be watching you

1701
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,710
so closely, I knew you couldn't change

1702
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:46,278
into the Unknown Comic.

1703
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:49,612
But my voice, how did you do my voice?

1704
01:18:59,282 --> 01:19:00,924
That was easy.

1705
01:19:00,925 --> 01:19:02,962
I found a tape when I was
going through your locker

1706
01:19:02,963 --> 01:19:05,557
of your act and so I put it
on the backstage microphone.

1707
01:19:05,558 --> 01:19:08,124
And nobody could see my
mouth moving under the bag,

1708
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,241
so I just jumped around on stage.

1709
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:11,819
What a great idea!

1710
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,987
I could franchise the Unknown
Comic and make a fortune!

1711
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:23,407
Melvin!

1712
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:24,540
Oh Sue!

1713
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:25,812
Oh Melvin!

1714
01:19:25,813 --> 01:19:26,646
Oh Sue!

1715
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,321
Oh Melvin!

1716
01:19:29,322 --> 01:19:32,905
Wait a minute, you've
got an act to finish!

1717
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,589
We can't make love like this anymore!

1718
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,722
Finish the job!

1719
01:20:24,723 --> 01:20:28,811
Hey, like Robert De
Niro says Oh, Oh yeah!

1720
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,185
Get down there you little cutie!

1721
01:20:32,186 --> 01:20:33,562
Way down there!

1722
01:20:33,563 --> 01:20:35,563
I'm going baby!

1723
01:20:45,114 --> 01:20:46,696
I don't believe it!

1724
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:48,235
Are you calling me a liar?

1725
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:08,774
And action!

1726
01:21:15,419 --> 01:21:17,086
Captain, uh, shit!

1727
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:27,004
We're coming.

1728
01:21:33,369 --> 01:21:36,508
Captain, uh, Kent Lane not reporting.

1729
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,395
Marker.

1730
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:44,229
Action!

1731
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:46,621
Hi, Sue!

1732
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:50,849
Action!

1733
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:51,683
Hi, Sue!

1734
01:21:57,463 --> 01:21:58,296
Hi, Sue!

1735
01:22:03,275 --> 01:22:05,004
And action!

1736
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:06,423
Oh hi, Sue!

1737
01:22:06,424 --> 01:22:08,086
Melvin, is it true?

1738
01:22:08,087 --> 01:22:09,561
About the size of my dick?

1739
01:22:13,655 --> 01:22:15,066
It's my business to know, kid.

1740
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:16,225
Hey, uh...

1741
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:19,575
