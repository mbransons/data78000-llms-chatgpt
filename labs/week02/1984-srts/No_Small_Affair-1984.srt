1
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,879
Sixteen years old
and obsessed with photography.

2
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:41,233
Most kids my age are obsessed

3
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,700
with the urge
that arrives with puberty...

4
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,308
which has a lot in common
with photography.

5
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,812
They both deal with images,
both are done alone,

6
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:53,184
and both require a steady hand.

7
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:54,617
I think there's room in my life
for the two,

8
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:58,892
but right now photography
is exerting the stronger pull.

9
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,533
Scott...

10
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,398
I do care about the band.

11
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,362
This is another approach

12
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,405
that I think
they'll like better.

13
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,439
Like L.A.
That's a better approach?

14
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,710
Excuse me... Excuse me.

15
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,520
Could you please move?

16
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:37,358
Hey, you're in my shot.

17
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:42,854
Would you please move?

18
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,660
Let's just forget it.

19
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,161
Fine.

20
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:50,661
Laura!

21
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,904
Don't do... Laura!

22
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,002
Wait a minute! Stop it!

23
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,468
What is the matter with you?

24
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,941
I hate photographing people.

25
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,509
People are the worst.

26
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:27,727
How's it going?

27
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,029
Great. How'd
they come out?

28
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,263
Came out pretty good. That'll
be...

29
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:32,937
Twenty dollars
is reasonable to charge

30
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:34,032
for a session of prints.

31
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,764
Why he wanted
a graduation photo

32
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:36,868
of his daughter is beyond me.

33
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,028
She only graduated
from beauty school,

34
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:39,937
and in my opinion,

35
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,598
she could have
used a few more classes.

36
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:44,975
She was not
what you would call photogenic.

37
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,347
I don't like to extend credit,
but sometimes you have to.

38
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:54,578
I wouldn't do this kind
of photography at all,

39
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,724
except that I need $8,642.

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,589
Whoa, Mrs. Mad Max
and her killer Doberman.

41
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,459
Morning, Cummings.

42
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:06,826
There's room...
really there is.

43
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,830
It's fine. It's okay,
Mrs. Bennett, I'm fine.

44
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,798
I can make it myself.

45
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,597
Nice dog.

46
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:16,437
No, no, I can handle it, really.

47
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,695
Don't worry.

48
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:20,502
Jesus Christ.

49
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,578
Uh-oh.

50
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:38,754
My mom must be
dating a real sport this time.

51
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,851
I can't wait to grow up.

52
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,829
I'm Charles Cummings,

53
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,462
if you're wondering
whose mother

54
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:57,526
you had your way with.

55
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,703
Hi. I'm, uh, I'm Ken.

56
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:02,667
I hope
you're planning to marry her.

57
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:05,912
You know, it is
the only decent thing to do.

58
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:53,154
What did you say to Ken
when you barged in on him

59
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,048
in the bathroom?

60
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,678
I didn't barge. I knocked first.

61
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,853
True barging is
when you enter without knocking.

62
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,851
What did you say?

63
00:05:58,852 --> 00:05:59,784
Nothing. I gotta go to school.

64
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,818
If I have a guest in my home,
Charles,

65
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,891
I don't think
it's too much to ask

66
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,629
that you be respectful.

67
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,484
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,722
And don't think
that I don't know

69
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:09,755
about you sneaking out
at all hours.

70
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:11,590
Now, that is going
to stop as of now.

71
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,797
Mom... Mom, I'm gonna be late.
Oh, Charles,

72
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,498
I want you to come directly home
after school today.

73
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,530
Your brother, Leonard,
is driving up

74
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,535
to introduce us to his fiancée.

75
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,777
Mom. Mom, we met his fiancée.

76
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,672
But this is a new one.

77
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,969
Mom, has it ever occurred to you

78
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,144
that maybe he tells you
he's engaged to these girls

79
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,745
so you'll let them
sleep together

80
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,545
when he comes here?

81
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,110
Do all kids today
talk back to their parents

82
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:38,049
the way you do?
Oh, no.

83
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:41,955
Most of them are too stoned
to speak at all.

84
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,598
Cummings, more coffee?

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,500
No thanks.

86
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,064
Last call.
No thanks, Grace.

87
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,968
Come on, let's go, Grace,
let's go.

88
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,574
Four-five.
One point four.

89
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,138
I never
get it right.

90
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,173
Oh, don't worry about it, Grace.
You'll live.

91
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,504
Okay, one more. Go for it.

92
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:10,811
Two-eight.

93
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,775
Two- Oh. Ooh.
Good eye.

94
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,789
Do you belong
to the photography club?

95
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,882
No.

96
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:20,553
Oh, arrogant. I like that.

97
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:26,720
I don't suppose you're going
to the dance next weekend.

98
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:27,953
No.

99
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:28,888
Me either.

100
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,722
Wanna not go together?

101
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,027
Um, my brother Leonard
is coming in this weekend.

102
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,989
He'll be real crushed if we
don't have

103
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,726
a full weekend
of sibling rivalry.

104
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:39,031
Oh, come on, we could
go out to the airport.

105
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,067
I hear
they just installed

106
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,902
these state-of-the-art
games out there.

107
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:45,174
I really don't think so.
What's the matter?

108
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,472
You don't like
aggressive women?

109
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,735
Well...
So, uh, you ask me out.

110
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,861
Cummings isn't into girls,
right, Cummings, huh?

111
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,980
Wanna go out with me?
Take my picture naked.

112
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:58,173
Oh.

113
00:07:58,183 --> 00:07:59,183
Hey, Mona...

114
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:00,244
What's your bra size?

115
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:05,011
Multiply the length of your dick
by 10 and add your IQ.

116
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:12,797
Ask a simple question,
she gives you a math problem.

117
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,283
Uh, Houston.
This is shuttle control.

118
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:40,182
... A renegade covert
mission fly here.

119
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:42,245
We are preparing to photograph.

120
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,487
Do we have permission on...

121
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,821
Uh, Columbia,
you have permission to fire.

122
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,756
And that's a two point eight
light meter reading.

123
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,289
Let's set
our camera accordingly.

124
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:52,853
Here we go. And that one's set.

125
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,771
Okay, guys, I think we caught
this sucker red-handed.

126
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,023
Oh, this is
a beautiful shot, guys.

127
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:59,691
This is beautiful, this sucker.
Don't ever get out of...

128
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,300
Oh, well, that's great.
That's great.

129
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:04,261
This is gonna be
on the cover of TIME here.

130
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:07,077
Oh, wait... we have liftoff.

131
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:07,674
Oh, boy.

132
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,769
It's not like
Leonard not to call.

133
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,778
Mm, it's exactly
like Leonard not to call.

134
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:17,842
Come on, don't worry, Joan.

135
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,009
The worst that happened
is they...

136
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,216
uh, they got hung
up in traffic.

137
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,280
And the very worst
that could have happened is

138
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,586
that their car ran off the road,

139
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:25,176
and they're bleeding to death
in a drainage ditch.

140
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,147
What on earth
is wrong with you, Charles?

141
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:30,558
Nothing. Why?

142
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:31,992
Whatever possessed you
to say such a thing?

143
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:36,056
I was just wondering
along with, uh, Uncle Ken here

144
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,164
what could be
keeping them.

145
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:38,665
I think that your interest
in photography

146
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:43,635
has gone past the point
of being healthy, Charles.

147
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,836
You're spending
too much time

148
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:47,967
in that darkroom with
those chemical fumes.

149
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:50,073
He's just going through a phase.

150
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,805
I got a call today
from the principal's office.

151
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:56,850
He was caught taking pictures
of flies in his French class.

152
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,847
Flies?
That's right.

153
00:09:58,849 --> 00:09:59,249
One fly.

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,716
Yeah, I mean,
all boys go through this.

155
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:06,982
Probably needs to vent
some of that excess energy.

156
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:09,786
Have a girl, Chuck?

157
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,351
No, thanks, I'm full.

158
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,024
Holy shit!

159
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,329
All right, Charles, if you
cannot conduct yourself

160
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:21,101
like a civilized human being,
you can go to your room.

161
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,100
Thanks, Mom.

162
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:25,701
Uh, you can have my dessert,
Uncle Ken.

163
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,170
Well-

164
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,974
The army might not be a bad idea
for a kid like that.

165
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:30,865
Oh!

166
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,904
I was-
I was in the Army.

167
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,304
It's been said
that life is full of surprises.

168
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:13,776
Hmm, my life is mostly
predictable and pretty dull.

169
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,707
Until this.

170
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,771
You haven't seen her anywhere?
You know her?

171
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:45,268
No, I don't know her,
Cummings.

172
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,670
No, never seen her.

173
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,700
No, never did. Sorry.

174
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:06,851
Someone said if you stand
in one spot long enough,

175
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,184
the whole world will pass by.

176
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,988
I don't know who said that,
but he's an idiot.

177
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,225
Welcome home, Leonard.

178
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,389
Yeah, my little brother.

179
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,295
Are you still playing
in the street, huh?

180
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,327
Hi, I'm Susan.
Hi.

181
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,801
Where's the red carpet?
Nice to meet you.

182
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,031
What, have you met?
No.

183
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,394
This is the lady
of my dreams.

184
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,802
He's got red cheeks, huh?

185
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:27,734
She's quite a gal.

186
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,070
Charles... come here.

187
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:30,735
Susan, here, come on,
make yourself useful.

188
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,041
What do you think
this is, a vacation?

189
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,624
Ma was really sick about you,
you know?

190
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,206
Charles, don't stand
there like a lump.

191
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,411
You got a free hand.
Come on, help us.

192
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:39,115
Jesus Christ. What have you got
in here, your old fiancée?

193
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,973
Come on, come on.
Show her in. Show her in.

194
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,342
Susan, when you get upstairs,
run us a bath.

195
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,889
That's a nice motor scooter.
I like that motor scooter.

196
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,385
So, uh, how long
have you two known each other?

197
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:48,420
Is there a tennis court
around here?

198
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:50,454
What happened? Mom said
you'd be home last night.

199
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,857
Susan got a throbbing case
of los hornitos

200
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,959
and forced me to stop
at a disgusting adult motel.

201
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,193
No, it was your Mr. Winky
that was doing the throbbing.

202
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,579
Mom had visions of you lying
dead in a drainage ditch.

203
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,965
We did the drainage-ditch number
outside Santa Cruz.

204
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:07,106
Ow! Yeah,
she can't keep her hands off me.

205
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,399
How long you staying?
Just till next Saturday.

206
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,776
We'll be leaving
right after the wedding.

207
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:12,340
What wedding?

208
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,774
Oh, Leonard and I
are getting married.

209
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,306
You know,
a simple ceremony

210
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,242
here in the apartment.

211
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:19,046
One minister.
Several hundred guests.

212
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:19,946
Did you tell Mom?

213
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:22,477
Uh-uh.
We wanted to surprise her.

214
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,116
Ma!

215
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,151
Mom, guess what?

216
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,121
I don't want
to hear anymore about it.

217
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,352
Because
we were both-

218
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,757
She took the news
of Leonard's wedding plans

219
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:32,858
better than I expected.

220
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,188
Leonard always seemed to get
what he wanted.

221
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:36,853
I never seem to get
what I wanted.

222
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:39,421
Fortunately,
I never really wanted much.

223
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,530
But I wanted
desperately to find...

224
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:44,931
A girl. Yeah.

225
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:47,763
Mid-20s.

226
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,800
Dark, dark hair.

227
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,835
Um, distinguishing marks?

228
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,069
Uh... a symmetrical jaw line...

229
00:13:56,077 --> 00:14:00,246
uh, finely sculpted cheekbones.

230
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,211
Her eyes?
Um, she has incredible eyes.

231
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,485
I have a photo
that I could bring down for you.

232
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,153
I have to call
a caterer... and maids.

233
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,558
Oh! It's the bride's parents
who are supposed to do this.

234
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:13,957
I should call them.

235
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,827
Who are you talking to?
The police. Missing persons.

236
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:19,357
Oh, quit being such
a smart-ass, Charles.

237
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:20,262
Who is this?

238
00:14:20,297 --> 00:14:22,966
Who wants
to see big tits?

239
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,068
Mom, could I finish
talking to them, please?

240
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:25,999
Who are you really?

241
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,894
Charles, come on.
We're going to the North Beach.

242
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,404
It's my engagement present
to Susan.

243
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,435
Leonard, I'm not going.

244
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,578
I feel kinda funny
looking at other women's bosoms.

245
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,204
Well, then, you just
keep your eyes shut

246
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,242
and I'll describe
every juicy detail to you.

247
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,276
What do you mean you're
not going? I'm not.

248
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,819
Please,
I am trying to talk to this man,

249
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,514
whoever he is.
I'm sorry, Ma.

250
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,314
Charles, grab your fake ID,
and let's hit the streets.

251
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,186
I'm terribly sorry.
Now, who are you?

252
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,292
We got the girls.
Show time.

253
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:04,935
Hi, there. Take a peek.
Hey pal, come here.

254
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,374
Come on in. come on in.

255
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,272
Charles?

256
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:13,212
Charles.

257
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:17,906
Hi. How are you?

258
00:15:17,911 --> 00:15:19,228
Oh, you should have
seen the size

259
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:20,545
of the chi-chis
on this one chick.

260
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,045
Wa-whoo!
Oh, my God, they were big ones.

261
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,448
I know I should have,
but I'm underage.

262
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,830
I can't legally look at
chi-chis- not even small ones.

263
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,214
No, no, it's no fair.
You're not having a good time.

264
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,991
Aw. Perhaps Susan'll
show you one of hers

265
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:32,321
when we get home.
I don't think so.

266
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:34,886
That's all right.
I'm not all that interested.

267
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,851
Well, we don't go home

268
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,893
until we get you into
at least one club.

269
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,167
But you have to be 21.
What do you want me to do,

270
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:42,292
wander around here
for another five years?

271
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:44,896
Oh, come on.
No, forget it.

272
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,629
Hey, wait.
No, wait.

273
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:49,453
Where are you going?

274
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:52,271
Wait... use my ID.

275
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:54,038
This is never gonna work.

276
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,369
Uh, I'm much better-looking
than you are.

277
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,310
You have to have a drink

278
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,977
to toast
my upcoming marriage.

279
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:00,911
All they can do
is just throw you out and,

280
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,083
uh, confiscate
Leonard's driver's license.

281
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,111
Uh, I'll probably get arrested.

282
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:05,875
Oh, come on.
They may not even card you.

283
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,417
Listen, I haven't been asked
for ID once tonight.

284
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:10,022
No, they'll ask. I always
get caught at stuff like this.

285
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,950
That's why I never do it.

286
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,056
Hi. ID.

287
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,561
Ah.

288
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,902
All right, Susan.

289
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:34,376
ID.

290
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,407
Let's see.

291
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:41,411
Uh, American Express gold card,
army discharge...

292
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:47,082
Uh... it's so rare I'm asked.
I'm flattered.

293
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:58,190
All right.

294
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,560
Hi. ID.

295
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,662
Huh?

296
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,263
That was easy.

297
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,295
Oh, yes.

298
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,142
The bouncer thought
I looked like somebody he knew.

299
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:11,035
Who?
Andrew Jackson.

300
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:13,506
Oh! Oh,
I want to sit on the balcony.

301
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,266
All right.

302
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,250
Hey, you. You work here?
Yeah.

303
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,683
What's your name?
Jake.

304
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,617
Jake- Just like the club, huh?
Yeah.

305
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,219
That's a coincidence.
I'm Leonard. Glad to meet you.

306
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:34,621
Jake, does she
take off her clothes?

307
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:36,572
I'm sure she does...
but not in here.

308
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,521
So, what, do any
of the chicks in here

309
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:42,365
take off their clothes?
No.

310
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,135
Why would anybody
wanna just look at a band?

311
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,011
Forget it. We're having one
drink, and we're out of here.

312
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,446
It's her!
Who?

313
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:08,050
Who is she? What's her name?
I don't know.

314
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,320
Good. Maybe he's got a friend.

315
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,061
Hey, move it.
Move it, buddy.

316
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,023
I tell ya, kid,
sit down!

317
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,504
Ernie. Out!

318
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,604
Let's go out.

319
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,706
Out! Come on.
I was a nice guy.

320
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,707
I let you in with that phony ID.
Don't give me any grief.

321
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,509
Yeah, maybe we'd better
get Charlie and just go.

322
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:46,211
Why? Charles is having fun.
No, he's not.

323
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,783
Hey! That's my baby brother!

324
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:52,023
Hey!

325
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,019
Yeah, get 'em-
Get 'em out of there.

326
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:20,774
What's your name?

327
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:22,578
Laura.

328
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,511
Let's go, buddy.

329
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:44,431
If he could, Leonard would
strap cymbals to his knees

330
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,259
and clang them during the act.

331
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:51,626
Jesus Christ!

332
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,080
I am not letting your escapades
spoil my Sunday brunch.

333
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:06,279
Now start eating.

334
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,219
Leonard,
your sausage is getting cold.

335
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:20,126
Mom, I, uh,

336
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,826
wouldn't worry
about Leonard's sausage.

337
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,528
You'd think that someone
about to get married

338
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,729
would have more sense.

339
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,600
And you can just
thank your lucky stars

340
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,434
that the owner isn't
pressing charges.

341
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:34,736
The bouncer knew
the ID was phony.

342
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,770
He even said so.
I don't want to discuss it.

343
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,702
I just want to have
a pleasant Sunday brunch.

344
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:43,106
These waffles are great.
Oh, well have some more.

345
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,178
May I be excused?
Yes.

346
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,647
When you clean
your plate.

347
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:04,625
I, uh, I gotta say
something here.

348
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:07,764
Charles, I know you look at me,
and you think I'm,

349
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,864
uh, some square dude, right?

350
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,166
I don't think that.

351
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,667
Now, don't-
no, let me finish.

352
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:15,767
I'm a '60s person, okay?

353
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,499
I smoked pot. I had long hair.

354
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,674
We all wore granny shades...
The whole bit, man.

355
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,841
But I don't want
to bore you with the details,

356
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,812
but I do want you to know
where I'm coming from.

357
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,245
I think I know.

358
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,409
Being weird and different
is not where it's at.

359
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,449
It takes energy, Chuck.

360
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:35,586
Energy that you could
put into being normal.

361
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:38,851
Boy, if you really work at it,
you have a real shot at being

362
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:42,386
a very successful,
normal person.

363
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:44,659
Okay, specifics.

364
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:48,362
You like to take
the, uh, the snaps, huh?

365
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:51,565
So get yourself
on the school paper. You see?

366
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,597
And you cover
the sports beat.

367
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:55,601
And you get yourself
some zippy clothes,

368
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:59,433
and who knows, you could
end up with a cheerleader.

369
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,374
He's right.

370
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:03,806
So, what
do you think?

371
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,749
No, no. Don't do that.
Don't censor yourself.

372
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,540
Huh...

373
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:10,649
Grounded.

374
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,309
As if Sundays
aren't bad enough.

375
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:15,717
Next time they ask me
how I feel,

376
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:16,879
I think I'll just give them

377
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,588
the old tried and true
"I don't know."

378
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,762
We are really good.

379
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,969
Is that why kids
almost 10 years younger than me

380
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,302
are on hot records and touring.
And what am I doing?

381
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,976
I'm sitting here
still playing bars.

382
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,968
Jake, would you talk to him?

383
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,737
I've been talking to him
for a week.

384
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,379
Hi.
Hi.

385
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:35,800
Didn't the cops
take you away last night?

386
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:39,018
Yeah, they did.
But my Mom bailed me out.

387
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:40,721
You'd better get out of here.

388
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:42,590
If Jake sees you,
he will break both of your legs.

389
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,356
Just let me give you this, and I
won't take anymore of your time.

390
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:47,261
Get down!

391
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:49,825
If that's the way you
feel, I respect your decision.

392
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm glad
somebody around here does.

393
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,402
You couldn't get
through either.

394
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,505
I gotta tell you, Laura,

395
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,006
he makes awfully
good points.

396
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,440
And you're the one
who's supposed to be

397
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,615
convincing him to stay?
You can't deny good points.

398
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,770
There's nothing good
about leaving the band

399
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,509
to become
a half-assed studio musician.

400
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:11,946
The money is good.
The hours are good.

401
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:13,895
I didn't ask you for a list.
The conditions are good.

402
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,811
Hey, if you two are gonna
slug it out, do it over here

403
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:20,648
where everything is already
broken. I'll be in the office.

404
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,789
Why are you doing this?

405
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,824
Laura, I've been playing
in a rock 'n' roll band

406
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,986
since I've been
in junior high school,

407
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:28,728
and I'm still
a struggling musician.

408
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:30,866
I'm too old for this shit.
Come on. You're 28.

409
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,931
Don't you understand
that if you don't

410
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,966
make it young in this business
you don't make it at all?

411
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,698
Laura, there comes a time

412
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,303
when you've got
to drop the fantasy.

413
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:42,434
Then drop the fantasy,
but don't drop it on me,

414
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,575
because, Scott,
I'm gonna make it.

415
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,709
You're kidding yourself.

416
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,585
I'll guarantee 10 weeks.

417
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,849
Five hundred a week.

418
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:06,527
Tomorrow night.

419
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,992
Yes, I know they opened
for Fleetwood Mac, Bobby.

420
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:10,695
I saw the concert.

421
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:13,698
Yes, I heard the audience.
No, they were yelling-

422
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,400
"We want Fleetwood Mac" is
what they were yelling, Bobby.

423
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:19,602
No, I can't go 750.

424
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:21,438
And I- I'm telling you

425
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:23,513
that I'll stand
on the stage and hum

426
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:25,667
before I go 750.

427
00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:29,345
Yeah, you think
about it too.

428
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:33,344
Jake, you don't need
to book another band.

429
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,749
Did you get him to stay?
You don't need Scott.

430
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,568
I can get Snuffy to fill in
on the keyboards. Please.

431
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,385
I'd love to help you out.
I think you're a great singer,

432
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:42,760
but it's gonna sound
a little thin

433
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:43,887
without the lead guitar.
No.

434
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:46,761
I'm in this business long enough
to know you need the whole band.

435
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,960
Okay, we'll get
another lead guitarist.

436
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:51,662
Let me talk to Murray.
Please?

437
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:52,698
Jake Lewis.

438
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:56,561
Jake, if we don't fill the club,
then you can get another band.

439
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:57,668
Listen, Murph...

440
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,428
And you don't
have to pay us.

441
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:06,507
Uh, hold the line
a second, Murph.

442
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:11,383
Jake, I have never asked you
for anything, but I need this.

443
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,619
And I'll lose the band.

444
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:23,386
Let me get back to you, Murph.

445
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:32,593
Ah, honey,
I know it's tough.

446
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,497
Don't worry, I'm not gonna cry.

447
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:36,099
What do you think,

448
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,782
I'm gonna throw you
out on the street?

449
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:41,466
It'll be okay.
We'll give it a try.

450
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,078
Thanks, Jake.

451
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,034
Oh.

452
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:48,844
You know,
I could kill that son of a bitch

453
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,074
for breaking
your heart like this.

454
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,140
Jake...
Yeah?

455
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:59,048
I know that feels broken too...
but it's not.

456
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,082
Yeah.

457
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,150
All right.
We'll give this a try.

458
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:04,996
But remember, I'm running
a business here.

459
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,820
If you don't draw,
we're just gonna

460
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,127
have to bring in
another band.

461
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,431
Jake, can you loan me five?

462
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:18,567
Jake!

463
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:21,069
Jake, open up.
Come on, let me out.

464
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,970
What? Who-
Who's in there?

465
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:27,541
You can bet it's not
a satisfied customer.

466
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:29,703
Don't let this happen again.

467
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:34,772
Hey!

468
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,996
He's a terrific
swimmer, isn't he?

469
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,194
You again.

470
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:58,098
You know, at an early
embryonic stage,

471
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,630
people have gills.
Just like fish.

472
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:05,566
Well, like, uh,
tadpoles actually.

473
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,543
There's a kid at my school

474
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:11,938
whose little brother
still has a gill.

475
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:13,576
It, uh, never grew back together

476
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:15,114
or whatever
it was supposed to do.

477
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:19,248
So he wears turtleneck
sweaters all the time.

478
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:23,355
What do you want?

479
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,557
Oh, nothing, nothing.

480
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,953
Well, um...
That's not true, really.

481
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,229
I wanted you to look
at the photographs.

482
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:34,269
What photographs?

483
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,802
You're the guy
who was yelling at us

484
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,099
to get out of the shot.

485
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,209
Yeah, that's right.
That's true.

486
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:54,110
I was trying to get
the street sweeper.

487
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:56,016
Well, the light's
not real good in here,

488
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:57,515
and they're kind of
rough anyway

489
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,047
because I didn't
plan for the shots.

490
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:02,250
I mean, I can do
a lot better.

491
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:05,988
Um...

492
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,991
So, uh, you come here

493
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:11,863
just to look
at this one fish?

494
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:15,895
When something's bothering me,
I come and I watch the fish,

495
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:19,538
and whatever's bothering me
goes away.

496
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:30,277
It's not working today.

497
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:35,776
Well, uh...

498
00:29:35,782 --> 00:29:38,581
I guess I'd better
be going then.

499
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,984
What I was wondering, actually,
is if you would allow me

500
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:44,185
to photograph you some time.
Uh, whenever it's convenient.

501
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:48,257
Look...
That's very considerate.

502
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:49,318
Do you have a portfolio?

503
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,225
I, I mean you should
have a portfolio.

504
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:52,887
You know, for publicity
and like that.

505
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:54,763
I'm really
a good photographer.

506
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:56,597
And I'm a really
good singer,

507
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,231
but I'm about to be
an out-of-work singer

508
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,067
unless I fill the
club where I work,

509
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,900
or play hide the sausage
with my boss,

510
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:02,832
which I'll never do,

511
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,195
and I don't have
a lead guitarist,

512
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,105
and I don't know where
I'm gonna find a decent one,

513
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,766
and I know that this all must
sound terribly trivial to you,

514
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:11,935
in comparison to your need
to take my picture,

515
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,804
but it's really important to me,

516
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,213
so I would appreciate it
if you would just go away

517
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,244
so I can figure out
what I'm gonna do.

518
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:31,258
Here's my number,
if you change your mind.

519
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:34,045
Charles Cummings.

520
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,230
Yeah, yeah. Charles.

521
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:39,934
Or, or, or
you can call me Cummings.

522
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:43,173
Fine, Cummings. Goodbye.

523
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:57,213
I only know one thing.

524
00:30:57,248 --> 00:31:00,946
I'm miserable
and you're a lucky fish.

525
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,290
You get to look at her.

526
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:08,960
You don't exactly have
anything festive, Charles.

527
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,591
I can dress myself, Susan.

528
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,886
So let's just give him
a white shirt.

529
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:14,293
Maybe he'll spill something
colorful on it later on.

530
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,925
You know, you are so lucky.

531
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:19,271
You get to spend
this nice, quiet evening

532
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,695
at home with Mom.

533
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,233
Charles and I gotta go

534
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:24,838
to this boring
old stag party.

535
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:27,307
I hate stag parties.

536
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:28,306
Good, don't go.

537
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:32,645
No, I'm just kidding.

538
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,677
We'll get you laid tonight.

539
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:48,247
Maybe we'll both get laid.

540
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,016
Why do you want
to get laid?

541
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,324
You're getting married
in a week.

542
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,856
Don't you love Susan?
Oh, come on.

543
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,760
Of course,
I love Susan.

544
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,302
Listen, sex has nothing
to do with love.

545
00:31:57,337 --> 00:31:58,956
Sex washes off.

546
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:00,195
Well, if I loved somebody,

547
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:02,170
I wouldn't go around having sex.
Oh, yeah, right.

548
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:05,768
You don't go around
having sex now.

549
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:06,771
Who are you in love with?

550
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:09,235
Nobody. I could have sex.
I just don't want to.

551
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,641
No, everybody wants to.

552
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,676
I bet you'd like to give
that singer a pump.

553
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:16,348
I would not.
Yeah.

554
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,846
I remember
asking my mother once

555
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,081
where babies came from,

556
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:26,315
and she told me
one of the most outrageous,

557
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,319
incredible stories
that I had ever heard.

558
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,224
It turned out to be true.

559
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,061
This is not natural.

560
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,897
Neither is that.

561
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:42,032
I never seen that before.

562
00:32:42,034 --> 00:32:44,474
There's something very wrong
about looking at filth

563
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:48,768
on the same screen
you watch football.

564
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:50,742
She will receive.

565
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:54,776
Animals and gentlemen...

566
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:57,411
I'd like to introduce
Stephanie.

567
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:59,012
Hi, guys.

568
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,277
Where's the man
of the hour?

569
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:02,216
Right here.
What is this?

570
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:04,890
What is this?
This is your present.

571
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:05,946
We all chipped in
and got you

572
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,053
a hundred-buck- an-hour hooker.
Sex surrogate.

573
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:11,085
Unfortunately,
we could only raise enough

574
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:12,022
for half an hour.

575
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:14,955
That's 29 minutes more
than Leonard needs.

576
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:15,991
Hi.

577
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,924
Okay, enough small talk.
The meter's running.

578
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,090
Could you hold on
for just a minute?

579
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,139
Come here.

580
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:28,134
This is a one-room apartment
you got here, Einstein.

581
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:30,869
Where am I supposed
to go with her, in the closet?

582
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,908
Take her
into the bathroom.

583
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,242
I'm not gonna do it
in the bathroom.

584
00:33:33,243 --> 00:33:34,976
I do it all the time.
Yeah, you're alone.

585
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:37,810
So just go right down here
behind the counter.

586
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:42,952
I, uh, I think
this is the climactic scene.

587
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:48,115
Guys, I told you,
this was a stupid idea.

588
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:50,022
Maybe she'll give us
a refund.

589
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,391
Um, I'll be with you
in a second.

590
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:57,997
My kid brother's here.
This makes me feel...

591
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:01,097
So, what are
you gonna do?

592
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,199
I know a place
we could go.

593
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:05,735
He talks?
Leave him alone. What, Chuck?

594
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,874
First, let's have a little toast
to my brother,

595
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,977
and then I'll tell you
what I have in mind.

596
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:15,007
Laura! Laura! Laura...

597
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,969
Would you get off the phone
and get out there?

598
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:19,340
What's going on?
I have no idea.

599
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,880
Let's go now.
She'll call you back.

600
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:26,412
Laura! Laura! Laura! Laura!

601
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,218
Laura! Laura!

602
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:35,487
So, what are you guys-
friends of Laura?

603
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:38,134
No. Just music lovers.

604
00:35:25,968 --> 00:35:27,499
That chick is hot!

605
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:31,304
She's great!

606
00:35:53,457 --> 00:35:55,626
Charles, hey.

607
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:59,194
Someone is here to see you,
Charles.

608
00:35:59,196 --> 00:35:59,926
That's right.

609
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,469
I told a certain someone
what you did tonight.

610
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,018
You touched her, Charles.
What?

611
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:07,534
You touched her deep inside.

612
00:36:07,537 --> 00:36:10,406
So I'll leave you two alone now.

613
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,272
You are so sweet.

614
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:19,017
Do you know that?

615
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,553
Leonard said you wouldn't mind.

616
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:28,218
I, um...
I have to go to school tomorrow.

617
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,889
Early. I have- I have
to go very early.

618
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,389
And what grade are you in?

619
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,223
Sixth.

620
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,128
I, uh, I mean, 11th.
I'm a junior.

621
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,487
Don't get nervous.

622
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:39,954
I'm not.

623
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:42,063
Good.

624
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:43,197
I don't know why I'm doing this.

625
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:46,268
I guess I'm just
in a very charitable mood.

626
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:47,998
And you...

627
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:51,032
You are so sweet.

628
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:53,371
Oh...

629
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,641
What's wrong?

630
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:56,605
Um, I have...
I have a headache.

631
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,409
Oh, maybe you'd like me
to rub the back of your neck.

632
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:02,941
Oh, no thanks.
I can rub my own neck.

633
00:37:02,948 --> 00:37:04,649
Thanks.

634
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,117
Can you swim?
I don't know.

635
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:10,481
It's just like swimming-
the butterfly stroke.

636
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:15,157
And... I was
state champion.

637
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:20,688
I'm, uh... I, uh...

638
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,636
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do,

639
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,263
but it's just such a surprise.

640
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:29,997
There's nothing wrong
with a little surprise.

641
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:31,603
Ooh.

642
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:33,104
Ooh!

643
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:35,066
I'm sorry.
Ow.

644
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,335
Oh!

645
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:38,146
Leonard
didn't tell me

646
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:39,949
you were into S and M.

647
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:40,405
Oh!

648
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:41,996
Look, maybe we'd better
just stop this

649
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:43,580
before you get a concussion
or something.

650
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:46,520
Listen, it really, it's...
it's nothing personal.

651
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,587
It's, it's just that I-

652
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:50,118
Look, I know.

653
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,153
I really do understand.

654
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:54,556
The first time
is always scary.

655
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:55,458
Did Leonard tell you that?

656
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,462
No! Uh-uh,
it was just a wild guess.

657
00:37:58,497 --> 00:38:01,466
Well... I want you to know
I think...

658
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,563
I think you're
a very nice lady.

659
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:06,564
Oh, and I think
you're a very nice man.

660
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,600
And when you're ready,

661
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:11,134
I'm sure you're gonna
make someone a very nice lover.

662
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:13,038
Thank you.

663
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,142
You're welcome.

664
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,011
Um...

665
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:20,636
What?

666
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:23,116
Never mind.

667
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,248
What?

668
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:27,082
No, it's really it's-
it's stupid. Forget it.

669
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:31,493
Look, I've had men ask me
some very stupid questions.

670
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:34,021
Well, um...

671
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:35,456
You know,
I don't want you to think

672
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:40,196
I'm- I'm coming on to you
or anything,

673
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:44,494
but, um...

674
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:47,031
could I have a hug?

675
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:52,467
I think that's a first for me.

676
00:38:52,473 --> 00:38:54,432
Yes.

677
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:03,417
Charles, what is
all the noise going on...

678
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:04,146
Mom!

679
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,481
Uh...
Oh!

680
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:06,582
Mom?

681
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,083
Mom, Stephanie.

682
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,613
Stephanie, Mom.
Hi.

683
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:12,078
Um, you're not
gonna believe this,

684
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,387
but- but Stephanie here
was state champion

685
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,189
of the breaststroke-
butterfly stroke.

686
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:22,331
She still has those
big, nice swimmer shoulders...

687
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:23,463
doesn't she though?

688
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,757
You must be
a wonderful mother

689
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:28,564
because you raised
an absolutely terrific son.

690
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,598
That's, um...

691
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,766
two terrific sons.

692
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,209
Grounded till I'm 40.

693
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,304
Well, I can see
my mother's side.

694
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:44,141
Naked women in your room
are tough to explain,

695
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:48,116
even if you're innocent,
which I still am, in spades.

696
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,557
Hi, Charles.
How've you been?

697
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,313
Fine.

698
00:39:53,554 --> 00:39:54,654
Hi, Charles.
How you been?

699
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:56,285
Hey, Charles.
Hey, hey. What is this?

700
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,650
Is this a Frisbee for midgets?
Give it here, Nelson.

701
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:01,719
Let's see how far
I can throw it, huh?

702
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:02,459
Whoosh.

703
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:05,132
Whoop, whoop, whoop.
Nelson, give it here.

704
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,460
Knock it off.

705
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:09,559
Nelson, give it here.

706
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:12,067
Seriously, Charles.
I've got this friend, Bruce,

707
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,500
who wants to go
to the dance with you.

708
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:16,813
Uh, you can flip a coin
to see who wears the dress.

709
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,183
Cummings.

710
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,381
Excuse me.

711
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,750
What are you doing here?
Hi. How you doing?

712
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,284
Great now.

713
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,348
I, uh, I just wanted to
thank you for the other night.

714
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:35,083
Mm, that was nothing.

715
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:36,389
Well, it really
meant a lot to me,

716
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,090
and I just want you to know
that I appreciate it.

717
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:40,692
Well, how's it been
going since then?

718
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:43,323
Well, I decided
to take you up

719
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:44,528
on your proposition.

720
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,129
So when do you
want to do it?

721
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:48,562
Um...

722
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:49,868
Um, this is private,

723
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:51,668
so, uh, would you
mind, uh, going off

724
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:54,772
and playing with each other.
Uh, toss a ball around.

725
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,841
Sorry if I interrupted
something with your friends.

726
00:40:57,876 --> 00:41:00,441
They're not
my friends exactly.

727
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:02,573
So when do you want
to snap me?

728
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,508
Oh, any time
it's convenient for you.

729
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:08,214
I mean, you don't have
to do this, you know?

730
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,176
How about this afternoon?

731
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:13,422
Today? Well, um, yeah.
We could do it today. Uh...

732
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,420
Here.

733
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,520
Here's my phone number.

734
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:22,785
And my address.

735
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:25,693
Tickle?
Yeah.

736
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:28,663
Just in case
something comes up.

737
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,396
Oh, nothing'll come up.

738
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,540
I just, uh,
have to go home

739
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,169
and get my equipment.

740
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:37,273
So I'm coming to your place?
If that's okay.

741
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:41,372
That's... fine.

742
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,776
Nice car.

743
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,276
Thanks. It's Jake's.

744
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:45,478
It needs a wash.

745
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:47,740
I'll see you in a bit.

746
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:02,666
I'm gonna
have to have a doorknob

747
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,890
installed on this thing.

748
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:20,941
Oh... um...

749
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:24,812
I'm, uh,
I'm here to see Miss Victor.

750
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:30,285
Hey, Laura,
that pain in the ass kid's here.

751
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,755
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

752
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,952
Would...

753
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,592
Hello...

754
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,758
Here I am.

755
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:06,511
I'm sure I look lovely,
so fire when ready.

756
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:11,522
Um, did...
something happen?

757
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:15,515
No. Just how I look

758
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:18,761
when I'm sitting
around the house.

759
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,625
Did, uh...

760
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,829
did, uh, did he do
something to you?

761
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:31,990
You could say that.

762
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:36,563
I read this article
about this South African tribe.

763
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:42,739
They had something like
50 different words for a cow.

764
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,510
It's interesting,
don't you think?

765
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:46,612
People have the most words

766
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:49,643
to describe
what they value the most.

767
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:53,754
I, uh... should have probably
read the article.

768
00:43:54,018 --> 00:43:57,987
How many words do you know to
describe the female sex organ?

769
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:02,957
Um... I really don't know
what you're getting at.

770
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,489
I'm sure you've seen a variety

771
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,593
written on the bathroom walls
at school.

772
00:44:06,595 --> 00:44:09,025
I guess.
So with all those words...

773
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:11,630
you'd think it's quite
a valuable commodity,

774
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:14,294
wouldn't you?

775
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,309
I'm sorry. Is this
making you uncomfortable?

776
00:44:18,344 --> 00:44:20,539
Oh, oh, no. Not at all.

777
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,974
Um, I just can't help
but feeling

778
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:26,906
that we're being watched.

779
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:30,988
When I returned Jake's car...

780
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:35,385
he told me
that he'd hired another band...

781
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:41,852
so I tried to change his mind
with my most valuable commodity.

782
00:44:41,857 --> 00:44:45,058
You, uh... you slept with him.

783
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:48,730
God, if I'd slept with him,
I'd still have a job.

784
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:53,430
Jake said he had
too much respect for me.

785
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,334
Can you believe it?

786
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:57,898
You just can't depend
on anything anymore.

787
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:01,843
Do you mind if we got out of
here and shot some place else?

788
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:02,971
Oh, no, no.

789
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:06,305
That's what I-
I brought the extra helmet for.

790
00:45:08,612 --> 00:45:12,853
Do me a favor and throw a few
of these things in this bag.

791
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:14,450
Um, sure.

792
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:16,591
This stuff.

793
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:21,982
I'm gonna go clean myself up.

794
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:29,893
I, uh,
I didn't know you painted.

795
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,560
I don't.

796
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,406
They're my brother-in-law's.

797
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,370
I'm just loft-sitting.

798
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,005
Oh.

799
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:01,661
Bye-bye.

800
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:18,968
Oh, uh, hi, Mona.

801
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:22,531
Cute. She's got
some nifty moves.

802
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:24,901
No.

803
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:26,742
What, you don't
like girls?

804
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:31,417
They're okay. They're just
not real interesting.

805
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:33,514
Not like me, huh?

806
00:46:34,716 --> 00:46:35,815
Pardon me.

807
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:36,747
Would you do me a favor?

808
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,083
Would you be kind enough
to take our picture, please?

809
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,988
All you have to do
is press this thing right here.

810
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:43,821
I- I know how to...

811
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:46,764
Go ahead. Go ahead.
go on.

812
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:47,894
Good.

813
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:48,988
Okay.

814
00:46:48,995 --> 00:46:50,956
Uh, hold it just
like that. Yeah.

815
00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:51,964
Cheese.

816
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:53,655
Yeah, that's great.

817
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:58,964
Thank you.
No, no, hold it, hold it.

818
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,071
No, wait, wait, wait.

819
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:03,011
Hold it, hold it right there.

820
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:04,136
Great, great.

821
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:06,995
I just only have
a couple of shots.

822
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,851
Oh, yeah?
No, you've got plenty.

823
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:11,976
It says 36.

824
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:13,947
Okay.

825
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:23,958
Oh, okay.

826
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:25,057
Hi.

827
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,260
Nice guy,
don't you think?

828
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:29,427
Wait a second.
You know what?

829
00:47:29,462 --> 00:47:31,862
We gotta do something
about your wardrobe.

830
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:34,182
What's the matter?
I think it's kinda zippy.

831
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,501
No... You always look
like it's about to rain.

832
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:37,600
Come on.

833
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:03,985
Look at that.

834
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,489
Unbelievable. Just "Diana."

835
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,822
And she doesn't
even have to use her last name.

836
00:48:07,828 --> 00:48:09,028
And nobody says "Diana who?"

837
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:11,068
Do you think
that'll ever happen to me?

838
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:12,093
Sure. Absolutely.
Why not?

839
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:27,876
Cummings, I'm starving.
How much money do you have?

840
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:28,677
Fifty cents.

841
00:48:28,678 --> 00:48:31,807
Fifty cents.
Some feast we're gonna have.

842
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:34,252
Wait, I've got an idea.

843
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:39,149
Would you mind
telling me what you're doing?

844
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:42,154
Just trust me.

845
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:44,718
Is this a day or what?

846
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:58,963
Hello!
Hello.

847
00:48:58,969 --> 00:48:59,969
I know you!
How are you?

848
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,009
Are you with the groom?
What's your name?

849
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:03,204
Yes, of course.
Where is he?

850
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:05,534
What's your...
There he is!

851
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,841
We're gonna go say hello.
It's so nice to see you.

852
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:10,173
Godspeed to all you guys.

853
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:12,674
I don't believe this.

854
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,110
What did I tell you,
a piece of cake.

855
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:48,804
Eighty-six hundred...

856
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:53,006
Eight thousand,
642 dollars.

857
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:55,014
And I didn't just make that
up either, you know?

858
00:49:55,016 --> 00:50:00,244
I listed all my expenses,
like airfare, rent, food...

859
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:01,711
Women, booze, drugs.

860
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,523
Why Milan?
Why not New York?

861
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:06,287
I mean, isn't that
where all the magazines

862
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:08,551
and all that are?
Well...

863
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,189
Milan is where they'll give
a new photographer a start.

864
00:50:11,194 --> 00:50:15,012
I mean, once they get a name,
then New York.

865
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:18,830
You seem to have things
pretty planned out.

866
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:22,933
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

867
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,198
Just... you tend
to miss a lot.

868
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:27,075
I mean, you cover
more ground

869
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,674
zigzagging around

870
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,838
than you do than going
in a straight line.

871
00:50:31,844 --> 00:50:37,014
Well, you must've had plans
to get where you got.

872
00:50:38,116 --> 00:50:43,915
Yes, I carefully
manipulated my life

873
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:44,955
so I could become

874
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,108
an unknown,
unemployed singer.

875
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,190
It's always
been my dream.

876
00:50:49,225 --> 00:50:52,055
No, but you see, you're
gonna make it. I mean...

877
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:54,222
Can I get you
something to drink?

878
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,070
Yes.

879
00:51:16,915 --> 00:51:18,254
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

880
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:19,709
To the dames
du toilette.

881
00:51:19,718 --> 00:51:21,317
Here. Do something.
Be a good boy.

882
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:23,779
Tie your shoe
or something.

883
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:27,855
Ladies and gentlemen,

884
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,319
let's now greet the bride
and the bridegroom

885
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:33,686
as they dance
their first dance together

886
00:51:33,696 --> 00:51:34,696
as man...

887
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:35,397
and wife.

888
00:51:35,398 --> 00:51:38,927
Nicky and Natasha.
Let's go.

889
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,807
That's sweet. Oh.

890
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,811
Hey, what happened?

891
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,649
Your girlfriend
leave you stranded?

892
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,289
Oh, oh, no, um-

893
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,053
She's just
powdering her nose.

894
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:11,119
Hmm. Hey, you getting
everything you need?

895
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,736
They treating you right?
Oh, it couldn't be nicer.

896
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:17,289
I can see you can
really hold your liquor.

897
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:21,826
You know the secret
of a good drinking man.

898
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:23,875
The more you eat,
the more you can drink.

899
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,659
Am I right?
Yeah, that's my motto.

900
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:29,408
You got a good
full belly, huh?

901
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,109
Oh, I'm stuffed, yeah.

902
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,309
I bet you are. Hmm.

903
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:36,951
Ah, let's just see here.

904
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:39,077
You got your champagne.
Yeah, yeah.

905
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,783
A pitcher of margaritas.
Forget your tomato juice.

906
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:43,599
Uh-oh.
Dozen or so bellini, caviar,

907
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:45,414
a few cheese puffs...
They were great.

908
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,821
Throw in some ramaki
and your assorted nibbles,

909
00:52:48,824 --> 00:52:51,294
I say it comes
to an even 38 bucks.

910
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:53,452
How does that
sound to you?

911
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:57,027
I beg your pardon?

912
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:00,160
Unless you want to throw in
a few dollars for the tip,

913
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:03,337
but that's
entirely up to you.

914
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:06,775
Wait, wait a minute.

915
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,205
Uh... Wait.

916
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,700
Wait a minute. This-

917
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:11,109
This is a wedding, right?

918
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:16,008
Right. A wedding
for which I am paying.

919
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:18,912
A wedding to which
family and friends

920
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:20,176
were invited.

921
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:21,416
A wedding from which

922
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,685
you and your lovely
other freeloader

923
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,919
are gonna be leaving
with the cops

924
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:28,824
unless you come up
with the money.

925
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:31,729
That's the kind
of wedding this is.

926
00:53:34,427 --> 00:53:35,397
Uh...

927
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:44,240
You think we're freeloaders?

928
00:53:44,275 --> 00:53:45,169
You're kidding.

929
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:48,433
You don't know
who Laura Victor is?

930
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:52,049
Lead singer of the Bygones?

931
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:55,448
Possibly one
of the biggest stars

932
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,884
this country has today.

933
00:53:57,919 --> 00:53:59,112
It's the truth.

934
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:02,070
Uh... May I drop dead
on the spot.

935
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,985
Kid, I think
you're full of shit,

936
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:09,449
but if you're not,
maybe we can work something out.

937
00:54:11,391 --> 00:54:14,930
I don't want to do this.

938
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,427
I don't want this.
You got me into this,

939
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,000
you're gonna get me
out of it.

940
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:23,001
Come on.

941
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:32,538
You are in for
a real experience.

942
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:37,147
One of us is.

943
00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:41,814
Give her a note.

944
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:48,489
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
a wonderful surprise.

945
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:52,158
Uh, we are privileged
to have with us this evening...

946
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,918
the, uh, very talented

947
00:54:53,926 --> 00:54:58,397
and very lovely
Miss Laura Victor,

948
00:54:58,398 --> 00:55:01,107
and she's going to favor us
with a song

949
00:55:01,142 --> 00:55:02,230
in honor of the newlyweds,

950
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:06,803
and at the request
of the father of the bride.

951
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:41,493
Bottle of the French champagne
for the lady

952
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:43,968
with my compliments.
You bet.

953
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:47,332
When you were singing,
I got goosebumps.

954
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,235
I mean that.

955
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:51,169
You were terrific, really.
I mean it.

956
00:57:51,204 --> 00:57:55,575
Well, not being
my kind of music, I did okay.

957
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:57,709
If you ask me,

958
00:57:57,711 --> 00:58:00,480
that's the way
you ought to sing all the time.

959
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:01,679
Nobody's asking.

960
00:58:01,681 --> 00:58:04,351
Well, I never heard you
sound like that.

961
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:05,720
Good.

962
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:09,122
Hi. I'm Charles Cummings.

963
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:12,520
Big fucking deal.

964
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:31,707
Big fucking deal.

965
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:33,276
Oh!

966
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:37,042
Come, come on.

967
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:38,672
What are you doing?

968
00:58:38,677 --> 00:58:40,511
I'm getting my key.

969
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:43,546
The key- oh,
the key to your heart?

970
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:45,508
No, the key's in my boot.

971
00:58:45,516 --> 00:58:46,716
No, it's the key
to your heart.

972
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:48,552
Oh, there it is.

973
00:58:51,022 --> 00:58:54,291
Oh, okay. Oh, my God.
My shoe.

974
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:56,021
Want me to hold you?

975
00:58:56,026 --> 00:58:58,125
Okay.

976
00:58:58,127 --> 00:59:00,326
Ready... and push.

977
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,239
Will you pull my boot
off for me, please?

978
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:12,636
I had a great time.

979
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:22,649
You know, I didn't even think
I'd like that kind of music...

980
00:59:24,782 --> 00:59:27,341
But you were great.

981
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:30,686
It's old people's music.

982
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:32,757
And the only reason
why you like it

983
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,189
is because you're weird.

984
00:59:34,224 --> 00:59:35,623
Hi, Laura,
this is Melanie.

985
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:38,125
I just heard about this gig
over at the Mark Hopkins.

986
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,260
They need a cocktail waitress
to work the afternoon shift,

987
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:44,632
and call Mr. Gregg
in the personnel office.

988
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:46,761
That's nice.
Good luck.

989
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:48,466
It's better than nothing.

990
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:51,598
Oh, I guess you're not home.

991
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:54,023
I tried you over at Jake's.

992
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,440
Uh, this is Scott, by the way.

993
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:57,671
I know who you are,
you idiot.

994
00:59:57,675 --> 00:59:59,336
Listen, Laura,
I'm really sorry to hear

995
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,374
about you losing the gig,
but I hope you're doing okay,

996
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:06,515
and I was
just thinking about you.

997
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,520
So anyway, if you decide
to get out of there,

998
01:00:09,555 --> 01:00:11,152
I got a big spare side
of the bed

999
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:14,006
and a window that gives you
a great view of the smog.

1000
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,825
I'll be up until about 11:00
if you want to call.

1001
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,554
I've got an early session
tomorrow.

1002
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,570
They're putting
this wave sound behind some...

1003
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:23,062
Chevy Truck commercial.

1004
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,508
How can he go to bed at 11:00?

1005
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:10,394
I don't think you want
to drink that.

1006
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,771
I don't need anybody
telling me what to do.

1007
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:20,401
I know what I want.

1008
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:22,271
I just want
to be the best.

1009
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,809
Laura the best...

1010
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:35,124
The best cocktail waitress.

1011
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,693
Laura, maybe, hey...

1012
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,121
Hey, what?

1013
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:41,726
"Hey, everything's
gonna work out."

1014
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:44,857
Well, maybe everything
isn't gonna work out.

1015
01:01:44,864 --> 01:01:48,504
Maybe I'm a lousy singer
and you're a lousy photographer.

1016
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,433
Now, don't say that.

1017
01:01:49,468 --> 01:01:53,152
Why, do you know
you've got what it takes?

1018
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:56,837
I don't know
if I've got what it takes.

1019
01:01:58,274 --> 01:02:01,673
You want to get to Milan,
then you'd better go right now,

1020
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:05,416
because it might not
be there tomorrow.

1021
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:08,813
And then what?

1022
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,709
You've got no dream at all.

1023
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:22,567
Just go. Go.

1024
01:02:28,432 --> 01:02:31,171
Please.

1025
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:39,718
I can't do anything
like what you're talking about

1026
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,324
on such short notice.

1027
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:43,255
Anyway,
we don't do this kind of thing,

1028
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,001
and if we did,
you couldn't afford it.

1029
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:01,508
Put your money away, kid.

1030
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,919
It was an important lesson
I learned.

1031
01:04:16,923 --> 01:04:18,752
You may be disappointed
by a person's humanity,

1032
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:21,726
but you'll never be
disappointed by their greed.

1033
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:24,727
I felt like I had just bought

1034
01:04:24,762 --> 01:04:26,395
the biggest present
in the world,

1035
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,829
and I was holding my breath
until she opened it.

1036
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:47,574
Hello?

1037
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:50,320
This is her.

1038
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:53,916
Do I what?

1039
01:04:53,951 --> 01:04:56,315
Who is this?

1040
01:04:57,321 --> 01:04:59,620
You're disgusting.

1041
01:04:59,623 --> 01:05:02,593
Oh.

1042
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,405
Listen, you disgusting-

1043
01:05:16,504 --> 01:05:19,703
I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

1044
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,937
What?

1045
01:05:20,941 --> 01:05:23,975
No, this is not
an escort service.

1046
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:27,809
Well, I'm sorry.
You're sadly mistaken.

1047
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,819
God.

1048
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,331
Hello?

1049
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:52,495
I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.

1050
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,440
I don't speak that language.

1051
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,820
I don't speak Arabic, no.

1052
01:05:58,855 --> 01:06:00,806
And I don't do that either.

1053
01:06:00,808 --> 01:06:03,807
Listen,
how did you get my number?

1054
01:06:04,776 --> 01:06:06,375
Hello?

1055
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,085
Yeah?

1056
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,449
Terrific. Is that a fact?

1057
01:06:18,455 --> 01:06:20,096
Listen,
I don't have the slightest idea

1058
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:22,820
what you are even talking about.

1059
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:24,725
I'm a cocktail waitress.

1060
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:26,487
No, I will not
talk dirty to you.

1061
01:06:38,803 --> 01:06:41,934
Hey, Laura, how you doing?
Look. It's Laura.

1062
01:06:41,942 --> 01:06:43,581
Hi, Laura!
How are ya?

1063
01:06:43,616 --> 01:06:44,909
Fine. how are you?

1064
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:46,943
She looks great.

1065
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:52,640
Oh, my God!

1066
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:56,450
Oh, my God!

1067
01:06:56,452 --> 01:07:00,652
Oh, wait! Would you wait?

1068
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:17,534
You.

1069
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:25,904
I wanna talk to you now.
I'm taking my mid-term.

1070
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,610
If you want to live
to take your final,

1071
01:07:28,613 --> 01:07:31,522
you'd better get up!

1072
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,087
She had a bad day.

1073
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:38,492
And too much coffee.

1074
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:39,818
Ow.

1075
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:41,888
I guess you're, uh, mad.

1076
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,091
Half the population
of San Francisco

1077
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,921
and some foreign nations
think I'm some kind of hooker.

1078
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:46,826
Oh.
Oh?

1079
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:48,561
How could you put my picture,
that picture,

1080
01:07:48,596 --> 01:07:50,525
and my name and my number
on the back of a taxicab?

1081
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:52,091
I didn't put it on
the back of a taxicab.

1082
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:53,838
I put it on the back
of 150 taxicabs.

1083
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:55,802
Why?!
Well, I- I thought...

1084
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:57,732
I mean, how could you do that?

1085
01:07:57,737 --> 01:07:58,836
I thought
that if maybe...

1086
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,430
I mean, what an incredibly
asinine thing to do.

1087
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:03,638
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.
Every pervert on the west coast

1088
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,541
has my number.

1089
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,171
Well, I thought it might
get you some job offers.

1090
01:08:06,176 --> 01:08:07,868
Oh, it got me job offers,
all right.

1091
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:09,178
Some sheik wants me
to have a scene

1092
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,180
with he and his eight wives
while he's in town.

1093
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:13,011
Good thing he didn't
bring his goddamn camel!

1094
01:08:13,016 --> 01:08:14,816
Uh, Charles.
Would you kindly fuck off?

1095
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:15,977
Laura, he's my French teacher.

1096
01:08:15,984 --> 01:08:19,454
Well, excuse me.
Would you kindly fuck-ez vous?

1097
01:08:19,455 --> 01:08:19,915
Yes.

1098
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:21,721
I guess I didn't think
this out too well.

1099
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:22,855
You're being too kind
to yourself.

1100
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,229
You've made me a laughing stock
with this prank,

1101
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:26,686
plus costing me my job.

1102
01:08:26,694 --> 01:08:29,223
Laura, I'm sorry.
I really am...

1103
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:30,858
but you were the one
who told me

1104
01:08:30,863 --> 01:08:33,493
not to plan so much,
to zigzag around.

1105
01:08:33,499 --> 01:08:35,668
I want you to get rid
of those pictures.

1106
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:36,701
I don't know if I can.

1107
01:08:36,736 --> 01:08:38,849
Why in the hell
did you do this to me?

1108
01:08:38,884 --> 01:08:40,963
I mean,
"Laura Victor. She's the best."

1109
01:08:40,972 --> 01:08:42,232
What does that mean?
Nothing.

1110
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,210
I just thought that one thing
might lead to another.

1111
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:47,500
I did it to help you.

1112
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:49,111
Well, don't do things
unless people ask you.

1113
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:52,611
Do you understand?
Just stay away from me!

1114
01:08:52,615 --> 01:08:56,055
You're a weird kid.

1115
01:09:04,656 --> 01:09:08,187
Come on. That is my face
and my home number up there.

1116
01:09:08,195 --> 01:09:09,727
I mean, how
would you like it

1117
01:09:09,762 --> 01:09:12,131
if you had your home number
parading around town

1118
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,867
on the back
of 150 taxicabs?

1119
01:09:13,902 --> 01:09:15,532
A hundred and seventy-five.

1120
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,167
I threw in an extra 25
because I like that kid.

1121
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:19,069
Oh, terrific.

1122
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,609
Look, I'll just sue.
I'll sue your company.

1123
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:23,005
Well, go ahead.
Everybody sues me.

1124
01:09:23,006 --> 01:09:24,976
Well, then I'll just rip
these goddamn things

1125
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:25,975
off myself, if I have to.

1126
01:09:25,976 --> 01:09:28,245
Oh, you are real tough,
aren't you, girly?

1127
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,874
Don't call me girly.

1128
01:09:29,879 --> 01:09:32,245
You're a beautiful woman,
but for the life of me,

1129
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,614
I can't figure out
what that kid sees in you,

1130
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:35,950
laying out six grand
so he can make you

1131
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:38,614
into some kind of goddamn star
or something.

1132
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,158
What did you say?

1133
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,525
Six-thousand dollars?

1134
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,993
He paid you $6000?

1135
01:09:48,995 --> 01:09:51,064
Yeah.
And you took it?

1136
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:52,692
Yeah.

1137
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:59,735
He gave up Milan.
Oh, my God.

1138
01:09:59,736 --> 01:10:02,835
I'm such an idiot.

1139
01:10:03,873 --> 01:10:07,072
He gave up Milan for me.

1140
01:10:12,178 --> 01:10:14,679
Could you call me a cab?

1141
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:22,683
Hey, how you doing?

1142
01:10:22,688 --> 01:10:25,328
Hi. Um, you're a friend
of Charles Cummings, right?

1143
01:10:25,363 --> 01:10:28,053
We share a common interest
in photography.

1144
01:10:28,059 --> 01:10:30,229
Uh, can I buy
you a Coke?

1145
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:31,159
No. No thank you.

1146
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:33,096
Listen,
if you happen to see him,

1147
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:34,031
or if he comes in here,

1148
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:35,165
would you please
have him call me?

1149
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:38,665
He has your number?
Everyone has my number.

1150
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:40,609
All right. Well, I'll have him
give you a jingle.

1151
01:10:40,644 --> 01:10:41,933
Great,
I really appreciate it.

1152
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,639
What's your name?
Laura.

1153
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,229
All right, Laura.

1154
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,000
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it, okay?

1155
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:48,007
Okay, I'll see you
around, Laura.

1156
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:49,009
Yeah.

1157
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,639
Whoo-hoo! It works. It works.

1158
01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:53,914
Did you see how she let me feel
her left ya-ya, man?

1159
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,214
You touched
her shoulder.

1160
01:10:56,216 --> 01:10:58,755
It's all connected, isn't it?

1161
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:02,755
Hello. Is there a Charles
Cummings at this residence?

1162
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:06,694
I'm sorry I disturbed you.
Thank you.

1163
01:12:29,825 --> 01:12:33,326
Sometimes it seems
like nothing ever works out,

1164
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:36,359
and what's worse is sometimes
things almost work out

1165
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:38,064
and then fall apart.

1166
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:42,336
If this is the way life is,
how do people stand it?

1167
01:12:53,278 --> 01:12:54,137
We're closing now.

1168
01:13:36,247 --> 01:13:38,682
"Dear Laura...

1169
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:41,017
"I imagine I'm the last person
in the world

1170
01:13:41,019 --> 01:13:42,378
"you want to hear from
right now,

1171
01:13:42,386 --> 01:13:43,986
"but I did
want you to have these.

1172
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:45,946
"I know I didn't make
much of an impression on you

1173
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,854
"when I said how sensational
you were the other night,

1174
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:50,460
"and how you should keep on
singing the same way forever.

1175
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:52,829
"I'm no expert
when it comes to music,

1176
01:13:52,864 --> 01:13:53,928
"but I'm a photographer,

1177
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,758
"and I know
that pictures don't lie.

1178
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:58,364
"I'm really very sorry for all
the trouble I've caused.

1179
01:13:58,366 --> 01:13:59,796
"Sincerely, Cummings.

1180
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,240
"P.S. I know you don't
want to see me right now,

1181
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:05,065
"but take my address.
Humor me.

1182
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:09,381
Consider it the last request
of a condemned man."

1183
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:26,818
Hello?

1184
01:14:28,457 --> 01:14:33,095
Yeah, sure.
I can give you a phone job.

1185
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,324
Can you hold on?

1186
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:38,145
Laura!
Oh!

1187
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,759
It's just me.

1188
01:14:43,935 --> 01:14:45,135
What is it, Jake?

1189
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:48,170
I don't give second chances
if that's why you're here.

1190
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:49,975
Oh! No, no, no, no.

1191
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,741
It's just that...

1192
01:14:51,776 --> 01:14:54,905
I've been thinking
things over, and...

1193
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,413
and, uh, I have to admit,

1194
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:58,347
I made a big mistake
when I fired you.

1195
01:14:58,349 --> 01:14:59,882
Matter of fact,
right when I fired you,

1196
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,146
I was saying to myself,
"What are you doing?

1197
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:04,585
She's a terrific singer.
A real talent."

1198
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,020
That's what I said, Laura.
Honest to God.

1199
01:15:07,022 --> 01:15:10,022
Don't get God pissed at you too.

1200
01:15:11,024 --> 01:15:14,293
Okay.
Can I level with you?

1201
01:15:14,294 --> 01:15:16,524
No. Continue lying.

1202
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:17,390
Okay, okay.

1203
01:15:17,397 --> 01:15:19,337
Uh, the pictures
on the back of the cabs.

1204
01:15:19,372 --> 01:15:21,431
Not my idea.
Oh, I know.

1205
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,302
I read the story here.

1206
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:24,801
What story?

1207
01:15:24,803 --> 01:15:26,034
The story here.

1208
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,908
There's a whole big thing
in the paper,

1209
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:29,491
with your picture
and everything.

1210
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:31,041
You see, uh,
you and that kid are

1211
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:33,841
a goddamn syndicated
human-interest story.

1212
01:15:33,844 --> 01:15:36,512
See? And it says
down there

1213
01:15:36,547 --> 01:15:39,179
that you sing
in my club.

1214
01:15:39,182 --> 01:15:41,015
Shoddy reporting.

1215
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,279
A whole lot of people
have been calling up

1216
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:45,385
for reservations
just to hear you sing.

1217
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:47,017
And you know how
I hate to disappoint

1218
01:15:47,022 --> 01:15:49,155
the paying public.
Yeah, I do.

1219
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:53,189
Uh, I'm desperate, Laura.
I've got a houseful of people.

1220
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:55,224
Come on.
I happen to know

1221
01:15:55,229 --> 01:15:57,762
there's an A and R guy
from Atlantic Records

1222
01:15:57,797 --> 01:16:00,297
flying in from L.A.
just to hear you, but...

1223
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,366
Jake, what do you want me to do?

1224
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:04,434
Get up there and sing
a cappella?

1225
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:07,335
I lost the band, remember?
No, no.

1226
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:09,978
The group that replaced you
will play backup.

1227
01:16:10,013 --> 01:16:13,108
Yes, yes. Laura?

1228
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:16,213
All right,
I'm an asshole, okay.

1229
01:16:16,248 --> 01:16:18,372
Don't you be one too.

1230
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:23,980
I mean, this could be
a shot for you, a real shot.

1231
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:51,839
I couldn't get away from her.

1232
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:54,236
I thought of throwing myself
under the next taxi

1233
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:55,974
as sort of a poetic gesture,

1234
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:58,008
but I opted
for a slightly less poetic

1235
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:01,572
and definitely
less permanent gesture.

1236
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:11,288
Did you get it?
Yeah.

1237
01:17:11,323 --> 01:17:13,993
You know, you're gonna
catch pneumonia like that.

1238
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:15,893
Yeah, I hope so.

1239
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:19,158
Put this on.

1240
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:20,992
Give me the bottle.
No. Put it on.

1241
01:17:20,998 --> 01:17:23,929
I won't give you
the booze until you do.

1242
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:26,574
Okay, I'll put it on.

1243
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:35,643
Okay?

1244
01:17:35,678 --> 01:17:38,537
Do you mind if I take a small
sip to take off the chill?

1245
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:40,945
Actually,
I'd really rather you didn't.

1246
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:43,918
After I gave you a raincoat?

1247
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,687
Okay, take a sip.

1248
01:17:51,957 --> 01:17:56,326
That's enough.
It's not that cold.

1249
01:17:56,494 --> 01:18:00,023
Ahh.
There. I put some back.

1250
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:00,661
Uh-huh.

1251
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:03,465
Just keep it.
Old age and treachery

1252
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:05,966
will beat youth and enthusiasm
every time.

1253
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:08,938
A word from the wise.

1254
01:18:12,573 --> 01:18:15,612
Excuse me,
I'd like, uh-

1255
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:17,139
You'd like what?

1256
01:18:17,144 --> 01:18:18,244
Um, I, um...

1257
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:20,214
I'd like to have...
have sex with you,

1258
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,344
but I'd like to be sure

1259
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:23,079
that you had
some horrendous disease,

1260
01:18:23,084 --> 01:18:26,183
um, preferably one
that could turn out to be fatal,

1261
01:18:26,186 --> 01:18:28,653
but not terribly painful.

1262
01:18:28,688 --> 01:18:32,458
How'd you like me to run a razor
over your jugular vein?

1263
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,090
How much would that be?

1264
01:18:34,092 --> 01:18:37,092
Oh, for crying out loud!

1265
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:40,527
We've been standing out
here an hour and a half!

1266
01:18:40,697 --> 01:18:42,931
Uh, Mia.
Send a bottle

1267
01:18:42,966 --> 01:18:45,595
of our best champagne
over to table number three.

1268
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,400
Okay.

1269
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:50,472
Yeah, uh,
the best domestic champagne.

1270
01:18:50,473 --> 01:18:52,702
Uh...

1271
01:18:53,507 --> 01:18:54,541
He's drinking beer.

1272
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:56,008
Let's just say
it's on the house.

1273
01:18:56,043 --> 01:18:58,342
You've got class, Jake.
Sure, I was born with it.

1274
01:18:58,345 --> 01:19:01,116
Waitress!
Can we order?

1275
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:04,718
Ladies and gentlemen...

1276
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:06,417
Laura Victor.

1277
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:55,059
What the hell is this
all of a sudden?

1278
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:10,736
Real good.

1279
01:21:29,436 --> 01:21:31,195
Thank you.

1280
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:33,371
Thank you.

1281
01:21:33,406 --> 01:21:36,805
If anyone of that description
comes in there,

1282
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,608
will you call me immediately?

1283
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:42,078
Do you swear?

1284
01:21:42,113 --> 01:21:43,612
You're a Catholic Hospital,

1285
01:21:43,613 --> 01:21:47,244
so you'd better not
be bullshitting me.

1286
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,678
Thank you.

1287
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:24,747
You gonna tell me where
that came from, huh?

1288
01:22:24,748 --> 01:22:27,278
I don't know.
It just sort of slipped out.

1289
01:22:27,284 --> 01:22:29,313
Singing up a storm.
Girl, you were sensational.

1290
01:22:29,318 --> 01:22:30,750
Jake, I'm really
glad you're happy.

1291
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:33,585
Yeah. Now there's
somebody I want you to meet.

1292
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:34,417
No, I gotta go.

1293
01:22:34,421 --> 01:22:35,922
Go? What, go? You got
another set to do.

1294
01:22:35,924 --> 01:22:38,323
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Laura, you can't do this.

1295
01:22:38,325 --> 01:22:41,294
Laura, you're not big yet.

1296
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:44,592
Hi. Is Cummings here?

1297
01:22:44,598 --> 01:22:46,498
Charles? No.
No?

1298
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,493
Actually, I was kind of hoping
he was doing something with you.

1299
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:50,200
No, he hasn't been with me.
Who is it, Leonard?

1300
01:22:50,202 --> 01:22:52,771
A friend of Charles.
You have no idea where he is?

1301
01:22:52,806 --> 01:22:55,606
No.
Oh, my God.

1302
01:22:55,641 --> 01:22:58,700
Isn't it enough that you
advertise on taxis.

1303
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:59,708
You go door to door too.

1304
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:02,838
No, I'm just
trying to find, uh, Charles.

1305
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:04,779
How do you know my son?

1306
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:07,253
Well, it's a long
and involved story.

1307
01:23:07,288 --> 01:23:09,248
Will you just
have him call me?

1308
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,650
Yeah. He has
your number?

1309
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,385
Yeah. Oh!

1310
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,852
I ripped out my phone.

1311
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:16,716
Um, can I leave
him a note?

1312
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:19,433
Yeah, go ahead.
Uh, I need paper.

1313
01:23:19,468 --> 01:23:20,286
I have paper.

1314
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:21,783
What's going on?
She ripped out her phone.

1315
01:23:21,794 --> 01:23:25,454
Well, I was
getting obscene phone calls.

1316
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:28,363
Oh, dear.
What a shame.

1317
01:23:28,366 --> 01:23:30,900
Uh, would you mind?

1318
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:33,806
You know, if you have a phone
with a four-prong jack,

1319
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:36,204
you could probably
plug it right back in.

1320
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:37,236
From Charles?

1321
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,299
You were receiving obscene
phone calls from Charles?

1322
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:42,811
Mom, shh. She's trying
to write a note.

1323
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:43,812
Well, I don't wonder

1324
01:23:43,813 --> 01:23:45,543
that she receives
obscene phone calls,

1325
01:23:45,548 --> 01:23:48,165
running around
dressed like that, but I mean,

1326
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,782
Charles would never
talk dirty to anyone.

1327
01:23:50,785 --> 01:23:51,885
Of course not.

1328
01:23:51,886 --> 01:23:54,226
Could you please make sure
that he gets this?

1329
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:56,591
Yes.
And it's, uh, confidential.

1330
01:23:56,626 --> 01:23:58,590
Don't worry.
Okay.

1331
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:02,491
Um, you know,
I'm sure that Cummings-

1332
01:24:02,494 --> 01:24:05,963
Charles- he's gonna
be back real soon.

1333
01:24:06,663 --> 01:24:08,503
Please make sure
that he gets that.

1334
01:24:08,538 --> 01:24:10,568
We will.
Thanks.

1335
01:24:10,603 --> 01:24:11,667
Good night.

1336
01:24:11,668 --> 01:24:13,599
Yeah. Bye.

1337
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:15,001
She took my pen.

1338
01:24:15,006 --> 01:24:18,734
Jeez, I hope nothing
happened to the little creep.

1339
01:24:18,741 --> 01:24:20,341
Did you
bring the note?

1340
01:24:20,343 --> 01:24:21,803
I hid it.
Where?

1341
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:22,851
Oh, I'm not telling.

1342
01:24:22,886 --> 01:24:23,975
Leonard.
No.

1343
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,919
Just look for Charles.

1344
01:24:25,954 --> 01:24:27,614
You're no fun.

1345
01:24:27,616 --> 01:24:29,785
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I see something.

1346
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,783
Go back.

1347
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,621
Oh, God,
I think it's him.

1348
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:44,327
Yeah, I think
you're right.

1349
01:24:44,962 --> 01:24:46,492
Charles...

1350
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:48,667
Charles. Charles.

1351
01:24:49,032 --> 01:24:50,261
This boy is blotto.

1352
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:53,327
He looks strange, Leonard.
He always looks strange.

1353
01:24:53,336 --> 01:24:54,936
Come on, Charles.
Come on.

1354
01:24:54,938 --> 01:24:56,467
Get up.

1355
01:24:56,472 --> 01:24:59,272
What have you been drinking,
huh, Charles?

1356
01:24:59,275 --> 01:25:02,476
Shame on you.

1357
01:25:02,511 --> 01:25:06,549
Don't laugh, Leonard.
It's not funny.

1358
01:25:07,346 --> 01:25:10,677
Okay, up. Up...

1359
01:25:17,856 --> 01:25:20,356
Take him home in the jeep.
I've got the scooter.

1360
01:25:20,359 --> 01:25:21,559
No, don't, Leonard. Leave it.

1361
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,059
Aw, you're
not a wife yet.

1362
01:25:23,061 --> 01:25:25,770
Go.
All right. Just be careful.

1363
01:25:25,805 --> 01:25:27,763
Always am.

1364
01:25:37,305 --> 01:25:39,404
Leonard!

1365
01:25:41,008 --> 01:25:45,787
Susan, as you put this ring
on Leonard's finger,

1366
01:25:45,822 --> 01:25:47,079
repeat after me.

1367
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:51,380
I take you, Leonard, to be
my lawfully wedded husband.

1368
01:25:51,384 --> 01:25:52,284
I take you, Leonard,

1369
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:53,848
to be my lawfully
wedded husband.

1370
01:25:53,852 --> 01:25:56,954
To have and to hold...
To have and to hold.

1371
01:25:56,989 --> 01:26:00,023
He really did it.
And I was glad.

1372
01:26:00,058 --> 01:26:02,588
I mean,
Susan is a wonderful person.

1373
01:26:02,593 --> 01:26:04,892
Leonard is a wonderful person.

1374
01:26:04,895 --> 01:26:06,594
I am a miserable person.

1375
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:09,311
I think this is referred to
as wallowing in self-pity.

1376
01:26:09,346 --> 01:26:12,026
I'd forget about Laura,
probably just after my death,

1377
01:26:12,035 --> 01:26:14,634
but I could never forget
the fool I made of myself.

1378
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:17,706
And not only was I a fool.
I was penniless fool...

1379
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:19,006
which is worse
than being the guy

1380
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,007
who collects shopping carts
at the supermarket.

1381
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,608
Can we have
the ring, please?

1382
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:27,710
The ring, please.

1383
01:26:27,714 --> 01:26:30,444
Charles, give him the ring.
The ring?

1384
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:32,649
The ring.
It's in your pocket.

1385
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:36,720
Oh, uh...

1386
01:26:36,721 --> 01:26:38,622
Uh...

1387
01:26:40,024 --> 01:26:41,823
Leonard,

1388
01:26:41,826 --> 01:26:45,025
as you give this ring
to Susan, repeat after me.

1389
01:26:45,894 --> 01:26:48,096
I take you, Susan, to be
my lawfully wedded wife.

1390
01:26:48,131 --> 01:26:51,430
I take you, Susan, to be my
lawfully wedded wife.

1391
01:26:51,433 --> 01:26:57,137
To love and share my life
from this day forward.

1392
01:26:57,172 --> 01:26:59,738
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1393
01:26:59,741 --> 01:27:02,810
Whoo-hoo!
She loves me!

1394
01:27:02,845 --> 01:27:05,008
This is so great!

1395
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,376
I love you, Mom.

1396
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:07,746
I love you too.

1397
01:27:07,748 --> 01:27:10,447
Love you too,
Uncle Ken.

1398
01:27:10,449 --> 01:27:11,819
Where are you going?

1399
01:27:19,022 --> 01:27:21,022
Hi. I just got
your note...

1400
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:22,084
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1401
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:24,491
Oh, my God! Ha.
Where've you been?

1402
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:26,093
I mean, I didn't know
what happened to you.

1403
01:27:26,094 --> 01:27:28,465
I phoned your apartment.
I went by your apartment.

1404
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:29,563
And I was for sure...

1405
01:27:29,564 --> 01:27:31,763
I didn't think I was
ever going to see you again.

1406
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:34,566
I didn't think
you'd ever wanna see me again.

1407
01:27:34,568 --> 01:27:35,127
You look great.

1408
01:27:35,135 --> 01:27:37,370
Thanks.
Um, these are for you.

1409
01:27:37,405 --> 01:27:39,602
They're beautiful.
Thanks.

1410
01:27:39,607 --> 01:27:41,976
I have something for you.
Oh.

1411
01:27:42,011 --> 01:27:43,708
I got a contract.

1412
01:27:43,743 --> 01:27:45,742
I'm gonna cut a demo
on Atlantic Records.

1413
01:27:45,744 --> 01:27:47,145
No!
Yes.

1414
01:27:47,147 --> 01:27:49,846
This is wonderful!

1415
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:53,915
Five-hundred dollars.

1416
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:55,917
But, but I thought
you were broke.

1417
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:58,519
It's an advance.
And if it hadn't been for you,

1418
01:27:58,522 --> 01:28:00,791
I mean, I wouldn't
even have had the chance,

1419
01:28:00,826 --> 01:28:02,022
and God knows
I didn't deserve it.

1420
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:05,126
Oh, come on. You're terrific.
No, I'm not.

1421
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:07,627
You're terrific.

1422
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:11,069
There's something
that I need to say.

1423
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:13,734
What?

1424
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:16,607
Well...

1425
01:28:24,108 --> 01:28:28,048
When I grow up,
I want to be like you.

1426
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:45,516
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

1427
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,686
I'm not going anywhere.

1428
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:52,631
I'm going to L.A. tomorrow.

1429
01:28:52,932 --> 01:28:55,067
L.A.?
Well, the A and R guy said

1430
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:57,202
that if I'm serious
about my music,

1431
01:28:57,203 --> 01:28:59,603
then that's
where I should be.

1432
01:28:59,605 --> 01:29:01,604
Well, what about us?

1433
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:06,612
That won't change.

1434
01:29:07,544 --> 01:29:10,073
We're friends,
and we'll always be friends.

1435
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:14,520
And it doesn't matter
where I am or where you are.

1436
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:22,791
Cummings,
you're my best friend.

1437
01:29:25,758 --> 01:29:28,218
Well, that's great.

1438
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,928
That's, that's just...
that's just great.

1439
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:35,660
Huh, that's, that's
wonderful, yeah.

1440
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:36,268
Uh... hah.

1441
01:29:36,269 --> 01:29:37,799
I guess things
are turning out

1442
01:29:37,804 --> 01:29:41,642
exactly the way
I planned. Huh.

1443
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,640
Great.

1444
01:29:48,744 --> 01:29:50,244
Cummings,
don't do that.

1445
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:52,816
I'm just having
one for the road.

1446
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:56,185
You're gonna get sick.

1447
01:29:57,218 --> 01:30:01,886
I am sick.

1448
01:30:02,021 --> 01:30:03,753
Um, did you know
that because of you,

1449
01:30:03,758 --> 01:30:04,791
I almost caught a disease

1450
01:30:04,826 --> 01:30:07,095
that I don't even think
they have a name for yet?

1451
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:08,594
Uh, not to mention
wandering around

1452
01:30:08,595 --> 01:30:11,794
in the middle of the night,
in the rain, in a garbage bag.

1453
01:30:11,797 --> 01:30:14,067
You know what you hear
about leak-proof garbage bags?

1454
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:15,666
Well, it's all lies.
They leak plenty.

1455
01:30:15,668 --> 01:30:18,937
But I won't bore you with that.
I should have known better

1456
01:30:18,972 --> 01:30:22,806
than to get involved
with human beings.

1457
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,840
Ansel Adams was right.

1458
01:30:25,843 --> 01:30:26,642
Rocks and trees.

1459
01:30:26,643 --> 01:30:29,475
Give me a telephone pole
any time.

1460
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,309
Things don't
play with your emotions.

1461
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:37,584
Machines and buildings,
and cracks in the sidewalk,

1462
01:30:37,586 --> 01:30:38,316
they don't lead you on.

1463
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,019
How do I
get out of here?

1464
01:30:40,021 --> 01:30:42,691
I must have missed something.
No!

1465
01:30:42,726 --> 01:30:45,989
I must have missed something.

1466
01:30:45,992 --> 01:30:47,192
Wait, um, here-

1467
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:50,002
"Cummings... please forgive me
for being such an ass.

1468
01:30:50,037 --> 01:30:52,095
"Wonderful things
are happening because of you.

1469
01:30:52,097 --> 01:30:54,596
"I can't wait to see you.
I love you."

1470
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:56,899
Laura, you wrote that,
didn't you?

1471
01:30:56,901 --> 01:30:59,870
Yes, I did.
You said you loved me.

1472
01:30:59,905 --> 01:31:01,771
I do love you.

1473
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:03,636
Then how can you leave?

1474
01:31:03,641 --> 01:31:06,650
Because I'm, uh...

1475
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:09,273
Cummings, isn't this-

1476
01:31:09,278 --> 01:31:11,280
I thought
this was what you wanted.

1477
01:31:11,315 --> 01:31:13,078
Oh, yeah,
it's exactly what I wanted-

1478
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:14,841
to spend my life savings
on a woman

1479
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:19,008
and have her run off to
Tinseltown to become a star.

1480
01:31:19,851 --> 01:31:22,152
Oh, forget it.

1481
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:27,762
And you can
take your scarf back.

1482
01:31:27,925 --> 01:31:29,942
And it may interest
you to know

1483
01:31:29,977 --> 01:31:31,962
that I got a D-minus in French.

1484
01:31:31,965 --> 01:31:34,234
I hope you're satisfied.

1485
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:39,669
I am beginning to get
a very clear vision

1486
01:31:39,704 --> 01:31:42,003
of how things are.

1487
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:44,808
I have just been fooling myself.

1488
01:31:44,843 --> 01:31:48,307
Shit! Ow!

1489
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,919
Oh, finally,
something around here works.

1490
01:32:00,622 --> 01:32:05,020
Oh, terrific. You're gonna
start that business.

1491
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:11,121
Come on. Okay, that's enough.

1492
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:15,896
Will you stop crying?

1493
01:32:22,104 --> 01:32:24,803
Will you please stop crying?

1494
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:29,906
What... Why are
you crying?

1495
01:32:35,348 --> 01:32:37,677
Look, I...

1496
01:32:47,424 --> 01:32:50,924
Look, I know you...
you gotta go.

1497
01:32:50,928 --> 01:32:52,928
And I want you to go, you know.

1498
01:32:52,963 --> 01:32:57,862
Well, I don't want you to go,
but I want you to go.

1499
01:32:57,867 --> 01:32:59,968
You know what I mean.

1500
01:33:02,103 --> 01:33:03,803
Yeah.

1501
01:33:07,774 --> 01:33:13,044
I guess I'd better go
and let you pack.

1502
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:16,381
But, uh, before
I go, could...

1503
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:20,919
Um, could I kiss you goodbye?

1504
01:33:31,995 --> 01:33:33,724
Mm.

1505
01:33:34,863 --> 01:33:39,372
Um, I never kissed
anybody like that before.

1506
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:42,268
I was pretty good, wasn't I?

1507
01:33:44,905 --> 01:33:46,804
Not bad.

1508
01:35:34,027 --> 01:35:34,528
Hello?

1509
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:37,299
Uncle Ken,
can I speak to my Mom?

1510
01:35:37,334 --> 01:35:39,468
Yeah, uh, hold on.

1511
01:35:39,503 --> 01:35:41,466
It's Charles.

1512
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:44,236
Charles?

1513
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:46,136
I'm just calling
to tell you

1514
01:35:46,138 --> 01:35:47,037
I won't be home tonight.

1515
01:35:47,072 --> 01:35:51,841
You're not coming
home tonight?

1516
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:54,474
Just wish him
a good night, Joan.

1517
01:35:55,879 --> 01:36:00,848
Charles, have a good night.

1518
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,589
Way to go, Charles.

1519
01:36:08,856 --> 01:36:11,455
You know,
I'm pretty sure all my life

1520
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:14,558
I always dreamed
in black and white.

1521
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:17,931
Last night,
I dreamed in color.

1522
01:36:18,197 --> 01:36:20,367
I think
it's a compliment.

1523
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:29,473
We timed it perfectly.

1524
01:36:29,508 --> 01:36:34,247
Yeah. I hate
long goodbyes.

1525
01:36:34,544 --> 01:36:36,174
At least, I think I'd hate 'em.

1526
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:39,149
I've never
really had one before.

1527
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,110
Cummings...
No, I-

1528
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:46,058
I shouldn't
be feeling like this.

1529
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:47,287
I should be happy for you.

1530
01:36:47,322 --> 01:36:50,991
But I'm a little too depressed
to be happy for you.

1531
01:36:51,026 --> 01:36:53,222
Final boarding

1532
01:36:53,228 --> 01:36:57,167
for United Flight 91
to Los Angeles.

1533
01:36:57,202 --> 01:36:59,251
Don't forget me, okay?

1534
01:36:59,286 --> 01:37:01,265
Hey, are you kidding?

1535
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:05,969
When I'm 90, I'll lie in bed
and just think about you.

1536
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,014
I love you.

1537
01:37:21,615 --> 01:37:24,217
I wasn't going to say that,
you know?

1538
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,453
I wasn't gonna get corny.

1539
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:29,927
Hey, any girl loves to hear it.

1540
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:34,456
I hope you say it a lot
in your lifetime.

1541
01:37:35,094 --> 01:37:38,393
I know you're gonna
hear it a lot.

1542
01:37:42,033 --> 01:37:44,102
I've gotta go.

1543
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:57,683
Well, thank...
Thank you.

1544
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:32,089
I could smell her perfume
and her body on my clothes,

1545
01:38:32,124 --> 01:38:36,208
and I felt sadder
than I'd ever felt in my life.

1546
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:39,710
I knew she'd have other men
in her life, but I didn't care.

1547
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:43,054
I didn't care
if she was 90 and toothless.

1548
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:44,410
I would still love her.

1549
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,117
I wanted to fix
every detail of last night

1550
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:48,149
and today in my mind

1551
01:38:48,154 --> 01:38:51,955
to make the memory
a photograph.

1552
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:57,927
I would never love anybody
but Laura. Never.

1553
01:38:57,962 --> 01:39:02,130
I would never make love
to anyone again.

1554
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:09,139
That's... almost... definite.
