854
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:44,453

NOT ME ANYMORE,

859
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,486

THINK I'M ME?

860
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,624
THAT'S THE PART
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

861
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:17,841
YOU.

862
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,909

WELCOME HOME.

863
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,410

864
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,247
WHERE'D YOU GO?
IT'S BEEN FIVE MONTHS.

865
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,149
YOU THINK YOU'RE
MY ONLY CLIENT?

866
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,886
I'M RUNNING
A BIG OPERATION.

867
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,487
I NEED TENANTS.

868
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:35,158
I MUST FOMENT RACIAL
TENSION, FAMINE, WAR.

869
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,727
IT'S FUN,
BUT I'M POOPED.

870
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:38,694
HOW--

871
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,898
HOW CAN I? DON'T
I HAVE ANY FEELINGS?

872
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,166
RIGHT.

873
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,435
IF I DIDN'T EXIST,
GOD WOULD HAVE CREATED ME.

874
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,037
I MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD.

875
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:50,705
THERE REALLY IS
A GOD?

876
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:54,010
SURE. HE RARELY MAKES
PERSONAL APPEARANCES

877
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,511
LIKE I DO.

878
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:59,182
YOU MEAN SOMETIMES
HE ACTUALLY...

879
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:02,785
SHOWS UP HERE, LOOKING
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

880
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:04,185
NOW AND THEN.

881
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:06,589
BUT HE'S NOT WHAT HE WAS.

882
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,325
VERY DISAPPOINTED MAN.
BITTER.

883
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,328
I TRY TO GET
HIM INTERESTED.

884
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,730
IT'S NO FUN
HAVING THIS TO MYSELF.

885
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,734
I SAY TO HIM,
&quot;COME FOR THE OLYMPICS,

886
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:21,304
SEE A SHOW,&quot;
GET OUT, YOU KNOW, BUT...

887
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,439
HE JUST TALKS
ABOUT THE OLD DAYS

888
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:26,609
WITH MOSES, ABRAHAM,
KING WENCESLAUS.

889
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:29,145
IT'S SAD.
HEAVEN'S HALF EMPTY.

890
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,548
HAD TO CLOSE
THE BIG DINING ROOM.

891
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,915
OH, COME ON.

892
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,216
WOULD I LIE?

893
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:37,086
HAD TO RELEASE
HALF THEIR STAFF.

894
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:38,687
PRIESTS,
CLEANING LADIES--

895
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,389
THAT'S ALL THEY GET.

896
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:42,058
BUT YOU'RE
DOING GREAT?

897
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,061
KNOCK WOOD.
SOMETIMES IT'S TOO MUCH.

898
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,496
SO GOD JUST QUIT?

899
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:50,100
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

900
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,671
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
HE DID SOMETHING?

901
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,662
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

902
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:22,897
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO CHASEN'S.

903
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:24,800
I DON'T
LIKE CHASEN'S.

904
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,069
PICK A PLACE.

905
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,605
GENARO'S.
I WENT WITH WENDY.

906
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,973
IT'S A DUMP.

907
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,274
I LIKE IT.

908
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,142
CHASEN'S
GOT THAT GREAT CHILI.

909
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:35,144
NO. I'M GOING
TO GENARO'S.

910
00:53:35,144 --> 00:53:36,111
YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.

911
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,747
LISTEN,
YOU'LL GET UPSET.

912
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,415
TODAY'S THE 15th.

913
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,384
IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY.

914
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,810
WELL, I'LL CHECK.

915
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,211
LET ME SEE.

916
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,613
YES, MR. FARBINGER,

917
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:13,214
I CAN CONFIRM
THE RESERVATION.

918
00:54:13,215 --> 00:54:14,818
FOR HOW MANY?

919
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,385
ALL RIGHT.

920
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:18,220
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

921
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,323
BYE.

922
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,226
CAN I HELP YOU?

923
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,827
HI, LOUISE.

924
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:26,228
HOW ARE YOU?

925
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:29,232
DO YOU HAVE
A RESERVATION, SIR?

926
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,200
NO, I DON'T.

927
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,169
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE NOTHING NOW.

928
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,238
[RING]

929
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,238
EXCUSE ME.

930
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,839
GENARO'S.

931
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,942
YES?

932
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,544
FOR HOW MANY?

933
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,881
ALL RIGHT.

934
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:48,952
YES, I'LL
TAKE CARE OF IT.

935
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,022
BYE.

936
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,332
MR. WAYNE!

937
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:06,335
I AM SO HONORED
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

938
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:10,339
UH, OF COURSE I HAVE
A TABLE FOR YOU.

939
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,941
WILL YOU FOLLOW ME?

940
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,941
SURE.

941
00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:15,478
THAT'S BILLY WAYNE!

942
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,079
HEY, BILLY, BILLY!

943
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:20,349
RIGHT THIS WAY,
MR. WAYNE.

944
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:21,951
OH, LOUISE.

945
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:26,856
IS THIS OK?

946
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,358
IF IT'S OK WITH YOU.

947
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,359
I'M HAPPY.

948
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,362
THE VEAL CACCIATORE'S
VERY GOOD.

949
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:35,765
JUST A BOTTLE
OF BAROLO FOR NOW.

950
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,967
OF COURSE.
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

951
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,573
HERE'S YOUR CHECK,
MR. SHELTON.

952
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,895
ENJOY YOUR DINNER?

953
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:10,466
WENDY WON'T ORDER ANYTHING
BUT SPAGHETTI AND SAUSAGE.

954
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,168
WHENEVER
I DON'T GET IT,

955
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,736
I HATE MYSELF.

956
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:16,172
COULD YOU GET
OUR CAR FOR US? THANKS.

957
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,042
I LOVED YOUR--

958
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,442
I LOVED
YOUR LAST ALBUM.

959
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,146
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

960
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,547
YOU'RE WELCOME.

961
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,949
WHEN'S THE NEXT ONE
COMING OUT?

962
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:29,118
HERE, SWEETHEART.

963
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:33,256
NEXT YEAR WILL BE
A VERY SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY.

964
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,357
YEAH.

965
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,625
YOU'RE ON TOUR?
IT MUST BE A GAS.

966
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,827
YOU'LL BRING
THE BABY HERE.

967
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:40,730
WE'LL TAKE THE BABY
EVERYWHERE.

968
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,933
THE STROLLER
COST ME 90 BUCKS.

969
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,835
HAVE A NICE EVENING.

970
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,436
WENDY!

971
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:49,038
YES?

972
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,439
THAT'S BILLY WAYNE.

973
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:52,875
HE KNOWS YOU.

974
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,047
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

975
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,049
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

976
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,450
HAVE WE MET?

977
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,051
I'M BOBBY SHELTON.

978
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,454
PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

979
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:06,856
BOBBY SHELTON.

980
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:10,059
I THINK
I'VE HEARD OF YOU.

981
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,460
REALLY?

982
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,195
WE HAVE A MUTUAL
ACQUAINTANCE,

983
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:14,464
STEVE KANTOR.

984
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,099
OH, YEAH, SURE.

985
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,335
HAVE YOU BEEN
MARRIED LONG?

986
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,937
SIX YEARS TODAY.

987
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,337
CONGRATULATIONS.

988
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:24,640
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WENDY?

989
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,342
WHEN ARE YOU
EXPECTING?

990
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:27,943
THREE MONTHS.

991
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:29,345
THREE MONTHS?

992
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,946
YOUR LAST RECORD
WAS TERRIFIC.

993
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:33,349
THAT'S GREAT.

994
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,618
BOBBY, WE REALLY
SHOULD RUN.

995
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,853
MAYBE I COULD USE YOU.

996
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,456
HEY, THAT
WOULD BE GREAT!

997
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,425
WHERE HAVE WE MET?

998
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,360
CHARLIE GRAY'S
MY AGENT.

999
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,362
HE'S A GOOD AGENT.

1000
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,362
IS HE?

1001
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,398
I GUESS YOU BETTER
TAKE HER HOME.

1002
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,499
SHE PROBABLY
NEEDS HER REST.

1003
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:52,502
I FADE PRETTY EARLY.

1004
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,103
I'LL BET.

1005
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,504
YOU STILL WORKING?

1006
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:59,509
YEAH. WELL...
NICE MEETING YOU.

1007
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,910
AGAIN?

1008
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,113
A REAL HONOR
TO MEET YOU.

1009
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,513
YEAH.

1010
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:07,116
GOOD NIGHT.

1011
00:58:13,522 --> 00:58:15,524
YOUR WINE IS READY.

1012
00:58:15,524 --> 00:58:19,127
THAT'S MY BABY
SHE'S CARRYING.

1013
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:27,136
THANKS A LOT.

1014
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,738
THANK YOU, SIR.

1015
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,141
THANKS FOR THE OFFER!

1016
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,656
THANK YOU, SIR.

1017
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,560
SHE'S PREGNANT.

1018
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:54,163
IT'S MY BABY.

1019
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,565
CONGRATULATIONS.

1020
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:58,567
LET ME OUT
OF THIS DEAL.

1021
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:00,169
NO.

1022
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,569
PLEASE!

1023
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,972
YOU CAN
GET HER BACK.

1024
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,174
YOU'RE A STAR.
WORK ON HER.

1025
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,909
SHE'LL DUMP THAT GUY.

1026
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:08,644
WENDY WOULD
NEVER DO THAT.

1027
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,345
TRY IT.

1028
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:12,948
IT'S A ROTTEN IDEA!

1029
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,550
IT STINKS!

1030
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,618
THIS WHOLE
THING STINKS!

1031
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:18,621
CAN'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?

1032
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,356
I'M THE FATHER
OF THAT CHILD.

1033
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:24,226
SORRY.
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

1034
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:25,794
STOP THE CAR.

1035
00:59:25,794 --> 00:59:28,596
I'LL GET OUT
OF THIS DEAL.

1036
00:59:28,597 --> 00:59:30,466
STOP THE CAR!

1037
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,734
STOP THE CAR.

1038
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,910
OH, NUTS.

1039
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,712
I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOU ANY--

1040
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,151
I HATE IT
WHEN HE DOES THAT.

1041
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:51,921
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

1042
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,589
I'M HERE
TO FIND GOD.

1043
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,792
THIS IS HIS HOUSE.

1044
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:58,428
IT IS? GREAT.

1045
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,429
SEEN HIM AROUND?

1046
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,596
SEEN WHO?

1047
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,297
GOD.

1048
01:00:02,297 --> 01:00:04,901
HE'S IN THIS BOOTH.

1049
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,634
WHEN YOU'RE
SPEAKING TO ME,

1050
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:07,703
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HIM.

1051
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,138
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ALL THAT.

1052
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,775
I'M NOT TALKING
FIGURATIVELY HERE.

1053
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,610
I'M TALKING ABOUT

1054
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,113
SPENDING FIVE
MINUTES WITH GOD.

1055
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,047
TWO MINUTES.

1056
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,782
SHOOT.
YOU GOT TWO MINUTES.

1057
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,650
OK, LET ME
TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

1058
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,085
ABOUT FIVE
MONTHS AGO,

1059
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:24,953
I MADE A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL--

1060
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:26,422
UNKNOWINGLY,
OF COURSE.

1061
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,957
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I HAVE GOTTEN

1062
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,526
COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY SCREWED.

1063
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,827
BEG YOUR PARDON,
FATHER.

1064
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:33,529
LET ME UNDERSTAND YOU...

1065
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,897
YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL?

1066
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,799
THERE REALLY
IS A DEVIL.

1067
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,769
HE LIGHTS CIGARS
WITH HIS THUMB...

1068
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,803
HE GAVE MY IDENTITY
TO SOME YO-YO

1069
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,639
WHO'S LIVING
WITH MY WIFE.

1070
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,074
SHE'S PREGNANT
 WITH MY CHILD!

1071
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:49,412
SHE THINKS HE'S ME,
BUT I'M ME!

1072
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,413
BUT I'M NOT
BILLY WAYNE!

1073
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:53,616
I'M HIM! BOBBY! ME!

1074
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,486
I NEED GOD
TO GET BACK TO HER.

1075
01:00:57,486 --> 01:00:58,488
EVEN
THE DEVIL ADMITS

1076
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,557
THERE REALLY
IS A PERSON GOD.

1077
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,957
I UNDERSTAND, REALLY.

1078
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:07,229
PERHAPS I COULD REFER YOU
TO OUR COUNSELING SERVICE.

1079
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:08,564
BELIEVE ME,

1080
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,332
I WISH IT WAS
THAT SIMPLE!

1081
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,333
SO DO I.

1082
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,801
I'M SORRY, FATHER.

1083
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:17,038
THE DEVIL TOLD ME
GOD'S A LONELY GUY.

1084
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:17,840

01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,789
I'M GOING
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.

1444
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:50,724
THE LEAVES ARE CHANGING.

1445
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:51,793
GOOD TIME TO GO.

1446
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,795
NEXT YEAR, I'M BRINGING
BACK THE GYPSY MOTH.

1447
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,066
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

1448
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:08,343
BELIEVE ME,
I'M POSSIBLE.

1449
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:18,152
IS HE DEAD?

1450
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:19,220
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1451
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,489
THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO.

1452
01:24:57,925 --> 01:24:59,527
I'M ME AGAIN.

1453
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,051
TOPHET!

1454
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:26,287
IT'S ME, BOBBY.
GOD.

1455
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,670
YOU LOOK
LIKE THE DEVIL.

1456
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,174
REALLY? I'VE BEEN
WORKING TOO HARD.

1457
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:56,250
THERE'S SUCH
A RESEMBLANCE.

1458
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,252
HE ALWAYS WANTED
TO LOOK LIKE ME,

1459
01:25:58,252 --> 01:26:00,855
TALK LIKE ME,
BE LIKE ME,

1460
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,857
BUT I'M GOD.

1461
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,359
YOU DON'T DRESS
LIKE GOD.

1462
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,360
WHAT SHOULD
I WEAR, A ROBE?

1463
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,327
IT'S 108
DEGREES OUTSIDE.

1464
01:26:08,328 --> 01:26:10,197
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1465
01:26:10,197 --> 01:26:11,999
YOU'RE YOU AGAIN.

1466
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:14,001
YEAH, I AM.

1467
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:15,603
YOU DO THAT?

1468
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,004
OF COURSE.

1469
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:18,106
HOW?

1470
01:26:18,106 --> 01:26:20,575
I WON YOU BACK
WITH A BUSTED FLUSH.

1471
01:26:22,409 --> 01:26:23,811
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1472
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:26,647
IT'S NOT NECESSARY
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

1473
01:26:26,647 --> 01:26:30,251
WHY ARE YOU SO
INTERESTED IN ME?

1474
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,754
I OWED IT
TO YOUR FATHER.

1475
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:34,155
MY FATHER?

1476
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:36,157
AN HONORABLE,
HOLY MAN.

1477
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:39,159
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
HAD SCARLET FEVER?

1478
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,561
KIND OF.

1479
01:26:40,561 --> 01:26:43,164
IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

1480
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:44,764
APRIL 16th, 1960.

1481
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:46,133
YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

1482
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:48,736
A LITTLE
AFTER 3 A.M.,

1483
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:51,139
YOUR FEVER HIT 105.

1484
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,673
YOUR FATHER WALKED
INTO YOUR ROOM,

1485
01:26:52,673 --> 01:26:56,043
KNELT BY YOUR BED
AND PRAYED TO ME.

1486
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:58,112
BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE PRAYER.

1487
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:01,716

1489
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,321

IN THE OLD DAYS I COULD
WATCH OVER EVERYBODY--
