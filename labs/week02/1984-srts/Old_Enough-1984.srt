1
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,732
Lonnie?

2
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,482
Lonnie, come on.

3
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,818
Isn't she
going to be late for camp?

4
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,212
She always makes the bus.

5
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,475
I watch her from upstairs, 
sometimes.

6
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:09,564
Lonnie!

7
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:10,434
Here I am.

8
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,921
My first meeting's at 9:00.

9
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,879
It's already 8:30.

10
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,707
I don't have to be down 
until 10:00.

11
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,231
Or maybe it's 9:30.

12
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,581
Is gymnastics at 2:00
or 3:00?

13
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,757
I think he said 9:00.

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,412
2:00. Linda's mother's
taking you.

15
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,761
Lonnie,
you better hurry up.

16
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,719
-You're gonna miss your bus.
-No, I won't.

17
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,199
Are we staying home tonight?

18
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,722
Uh, yeah, I'm not through
until 7:00.

19
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,768
Yeah, me neither.
Nor 7:30, maybe.

20
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,509
We're doing back walkovers.

21
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,640
Dinner at 7:30, then?

22
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,294
We better make it 8:00.

23
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,817
Oh, I can't keep
Katherine that late.

24
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,167
Leave dinner in the oven.

25
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,125
Or maybe back handsprings.

26
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,040
But then we can't have fish,
it'll dry out.

27
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,563
Well, then, don't have fish.

28
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,304
Maybe handsprings
are next week.

29
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,088
But she
already bought the fish.

30
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,220
Snapper.

31
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,358
What takes you so long
every morning?

32
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,663
What do you do up there?

33
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,317
Get dressed.

34
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,014
Ah, you wear
the same thing every day.

35
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,407
Camp's over in a week, 
isn't it?

36
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,582
What are you gonna do then,

37
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,931
when you can wear
anything you want?

38
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,933
We'll never get to see you.

39
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,153
I'll wear the same thing
all my life.

40
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,940
So we have to have the fish.

41
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,333
Well, then, have the fish.

42
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,161
I hope handsprings
are this week.

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,336
Well, it'll dry out.

44
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,903
Then, don't have the fish.

45
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,252
Don't have the fish.

46
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,819
All right.
We'll have the fish.

47
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,516
I hate fish.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,257
You better do your hair and go.

49
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,737
It's done.

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,999
Lonnie,
take off that scarf,

51
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,436
and put on the bandeau,
the way I like it.

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,395
I'm wearing it this way today.

53
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,745
Lonnie, would you do it
and stop fussing?

54
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,529
It looks cute with the bandeau.

55
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:46,878
I don't wanna look cute.

56
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,011
Don't talk back
to your mother.

57
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,369
That's cute.

58
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,234
Hey, you're playing
or what?

59
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:41,933
Pervert!

60
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,111
Come on.

61
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:58,689
Jump!

62
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,083
Johnny, move it, man.

63
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,519
What are you, scared?

64
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,261
What's the matter?
You scared, chicken-lips?

65
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,828
Shut up.

66
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,873
- Shut up.
- Shut up, will you?

67
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,179
Shut up, will you?

68
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,963
Come on, you jump.

69
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,184
You fall on your face?

70
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,969
Come on.

71
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,845
Hey, come on, sucker,
that ain't bad.

72
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,063
What's the matter with you?

73
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,543
Johnny, you should back off.

74
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,675
Just jump.

75
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:28,719
Come on.

76
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:29,720
Jump!

77
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:36,031
-Your sister's --
-What'd you say?

78
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,467
Your sister's...

79
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,687
You wouldn't know
what to do with it.

80
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,517
I'll see you suckers later.

81
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,693
- Come on, Johnny.
- Johnny, come on.

82
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,347
Come on, don't go.

83
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,827
Hey, Red Raider.

84
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:51,742
Oh, come on, Johnny.

85
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:52,961
Johnny, come on.

86
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,833
- Johnny.
- Johnny.

87
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,357
Forget you, man.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,402
-Come on, give me the ball.
-Hey, where are you going?

89
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,795
I'm going with Johnny.

90
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,231
What about the game?

91
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,538
Forget about the game,
we got better things to do.

92
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:56,285
Ma! I forgot my keys!

93
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,700
Look who's here.

94
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,007
Hey, Johnny, 
your sister's looking hot.

95
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,704
Yeah, if you like baby fat.

96
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,925
Hey, Karen,
where did you get the war paint?

97
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,016
Shut up.

98
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,019
Well,
I think you look good.

99
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,324
You look real good.

100
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,113
Hey, Karen, I think you got
a piece of dirt on your face.

101
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,984
It's a beauty mark.

102
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,423
Hey, Karen, we're just kidding.

103
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,256
Hey, Red Raider.

104
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,999
My name's Lonnie.

105
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,523
You live here?

106
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,046
Yeah.

107
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,006
Which floor do you live on?

108
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,224
All of them.

109
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,227
All of them?

110
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,360
Your father is the super?

111
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:39,709
What?

112
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,190
You got all four floors
to yourself?

113
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,191
Yeah.

114
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,453
It's our house.

115
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,412
You got a big family?

116
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,719
Four people.

117
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,416
That's it?

118
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,331
Yeah.

119
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,249
So can I come in or what?

120
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,163
Why?

121
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:01,992
I don't know.

122
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,216
She's coming over
for a while.

123
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,447
Who's she?

124
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,710
Katherine.

125
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,450
She takes care of us.

126
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,855
Come on.

127
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,861
Come on.

128
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,998
Do you wanna play something?

129
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,868
Huh?

130
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,218
I've got some games.

131
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,394
Like what?

132
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,226
Life, Risk.

133
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,924
No, that takes too long.

134
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,708
Monopoly? Stratego?

135
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:06,753
Candy Land?

136
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:07,971
That's stupid.

137
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,930
Scavenger Hunt? Domain?

138
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:23,378
Holy shit!

139
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,684
Oh, Christ.

140
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,471
It ain't funny!

141
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,908
Sorry.

142
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,825
So, which do you wanna play?

143
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,915
I'm not in the mood.

144
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,359
Where'd you get this?

145
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:49,839
It was a present.

146
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,841
Real?

147
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,452
I guess.

148
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,106
You can tell if it's fake,

149
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,543
if the probe part comes off
when you scratch it.

150
00:11:58,587 --> 00:11:59,588
Hey!

151
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,990
I guess it's the real thing.

152
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,347
I bet it cost a lot.

153
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,707
I'm going.

154
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,612
She dresses funny.

155
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,658
Yeah.

156
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,138
I like it.

157
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,338
Come on.

158
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,861
What?

159
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,950
I wanna teach you something.

160
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,778
I can't. I got to get on.

161
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,215
Do what you want.

162
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,130
Sounds boring to me.

163
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,437
Wait a second.

164
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,527
I don't feel good.
I'm going home.

165
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,572
It's okay. My mom will call.

166
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:12,808
Wait a second.

167
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,765
Hang up.

168
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,116
This is a cinch.

169
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,378
They'll know.

170
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,640
They'll figure it out.

171
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,337
Trust me. Shh.

172
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,168
Uh...

173
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,084
Yeah, hold on a sec.

174
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,825
Say, "I'm concerned
about her health."

175
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,696
-It's what she always says.
-Huh?

176
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,177
-Just say it.
-Uh...

177
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,310
I'm concerned about her health.

178
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,228
Lonnie, Lonnie, yeah.

179
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,274
This is Missus, Missus...

180
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,363
- Sloan.
- Sloan.

181
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,017
Yeah.

182
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,714
She's sick or something.

183
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:50,890
I'm sure she'll be all right.

184
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,803
Yeah.

185
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,155
Yeah. Listen,
don't worry about it.

186
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,983
Don't worry about it.

187
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,551
Jesus, they already
got you dead and buried.

188
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,250
-So?
-So, no problem.

189
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,295
Okay, you ready?

190
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,427
For what?

191
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,950
Well, if you wanna hang around
with me,

192
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,473
I got to teach you stuff.

193
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,562
-Okay?
-Okay.

194
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,262
Just don't look anyone
in the face

195
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,306
or you're cooked,

196
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,829
and that includes me.

197
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,961
Got it?

198
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:19,701
Yeah.

199
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,660
So, go.

200
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,495
And get good stuff.

201
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,330
Excuse me.

202
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,680
Sorry.

203
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,508
Don't take all day.

204
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,443
Can I help you with something?

205
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,097
No, I'm just looking.

206
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,021
Chicken.

207
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,936
I'm cutting out here now.

208
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,262
You forget something?

209
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,612
-No.
-Maybe paying?

210
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,441
You in on this, too, kid?

211
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:48,920
No, it's just me.

212
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,096
She didn't do anything.

213
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,315
Yeah, but you did.
Let's have it.

214
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,664
Show him what you got.

215
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,796
In your back pocket.

216
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,668
And what's in the bag?

217
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:58,843
Come on, all of it.

218
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,630
What about you?

219
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,588
I told you. It's just me.

220
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,634
Next time,
steal it from your mother.

221
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,897
Now get the hell
out of here and stay out.

222
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,137
I'm never going in there again.

223
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,660
That guy sees everything.

224
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,446
Not everything.

225
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,891
Wow.

226
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,807
I've done better before.

227
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,638
How'd you get all this?

228
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:55,813
Simple.

229
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,599
I like this color, though.

230
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,600
Look.

231
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,818
Purple passion,

232
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,124
that's good.

233
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:07,173
What I really want
is fiery red.

234
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,131
That's my color.

235
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,485
Hey, I got perfect lips,
you know.

236
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,099
Two points, perfect.

237
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,408
No, you ain't got it.

238
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,627
Sister Mary Margaret

239
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,716
is always getting
pissed off at me

240
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,892
for wearing so much makeup.

241
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,981
You know what I told her?

242
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:36,245
Told her
that if God made me perfect,

243
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,899
I might as well show it.

244
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,380
You know what I mean?

245
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:44,514
She threw me in Father Stitch's
office for that one.

246
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,429
You have nuns for teachers?

247
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,214
Yeah. Don't you?

248
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,259
I don't think so.

249
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,566
Every one of 'em,

250
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,873
and they all got
the exact same glasses.

251
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,833
You know,
those plastic gray kind?

252
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,662
The kind with the chain
around the neck?

253
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,059
And they all wear
them cripple shoes.

254
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,759
They don't get married,
you know.

255
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,282
Yeah, I know.

256
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,981
But I seen Father Stitch
and some of them nuns.

257
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:20,420
My music teacher was in love
with my science teacher.

258
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,769
How'd you know?

259
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:22,987
You could tell.

260
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,424
Whenever we had music,
he'd come in

261
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,295
and ask her some dumb question.

262
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,601
Like, "Do you have an eraser?"

263
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,168
Or "When's the period over?"

264
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:29,733
Big deal.

265
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,955
And he leaned over her,
way over her.

266
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,783
What are you, queer?

267
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,092
Did they ever kiss?

268
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,268
I guess.

269
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:43,834
Where?

270
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,053
How do I know?

271
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,621
They ever make out?

272
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,970
Are you kidding?

273
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,712
Sister Evangeline

274
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,628
was making out
with Father Stitch

275
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:56,760
right in the chapel,

276
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,675
at the altar.

277
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,243
Karen?

278
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,474
Karen?

279
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,440
This is Lonnie.
She lives around the block.

280
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,920
Nice to meet you.

281
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,010
What do you want?

282
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,665
I want you to try this on
so I can hem it.

283
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,927
That thing?

284
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,668
I'm not wearing that.

285
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:38,280
What do you want me to look
like, some wrinkly nun?

286
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:41,457
Don't talk about the sisters
like that, do you hear me?

287
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,286
This is a confirmation,
not some party of yours.

288
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,287
Slip it on.

289
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,158
-Now?
-Now.

290
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:05,089
I thought I told you
to be here at 3:00.

291
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,439
It ain't 3:00 anymore.

292
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,616
-Sorry.
-What?

293
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:11,879
Apologize right to your father.

294
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,317
I said I'm sorry. Okay?

295
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,016
Sorry don't fix water pipes.

296
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,496
Look at me.

297
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,283
I had stuff to do, Dad.

298
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,719
Stuff?

299
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,155
Yeah, things.

300
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,244
Oh, things.

301
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,334
I sure don't wanna mess up
whatever things you got going.

302
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:33,901
Yeah, right.

303
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,296
Come here.

304
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,820
Over here.

305
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,302
Here.

306
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,306
If I got things to do,
your things ain't worth shit,

307
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,263
you hear me?

308
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,832
Smith from 4B called,
the toilet's backed up.

309
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,268
They called twice already.

310
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,010
Jesus, what the hell, are they
swim in it?

311
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,490
Hmm?

312
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,277
Or maybe they dance on it?

313
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,497
Oh, stop that.

314
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,889
Mother Mary, stop it.

315
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,195
I have work to do.

316
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:10,372
You're gonna look real nice.

317
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,117
Hey, Sloan.

318
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:23,603
Uh...
Thanks.

319
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,213
For what?

320
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,042
For covering for me
over at the store.

321
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,522
That's okay.

322
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:30,610
Okay.

323
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,002
See you tomorrow, then.

324
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,787
I can't. I have camp.

325
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,702
So? Skip out.

326
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:38,531
Tomorrow's an overnight,
two straight days.

327
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,359
I'm not supposed to be home
in-between.

328
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:44,798
So? Take an overnight
at my house.

329
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:47,017
It's better than sleeping
on a hunk of mud.

330
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:47,888
How can I?

331
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,804
I don't know. Figure it out.

332
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:04,383
How was camp?

333
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,429
Good.

334
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,257
Mm-hmm.

335
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,128
I mean, okay.

336
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,264
You know, the same.

337
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,051
We had nature today.

338
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,792
Oh, great.

339
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,882
You had nature yesterday.

340
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,190
Oh, yeah.

341
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,279
I guess I mixed it up.

342
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,195
We had boating today.

343
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:35,196
Mm-hmm.

344
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,763
It was pretty good.

345
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,683
I mean, it was fun.

346
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,989
That's the first positive thing
I've heard you say

347
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,077
about camp in a month.

348
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,907
Maybe we should sign you up
for three or four more weeks.

349
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,474
No!

350
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,348
I mean, you can't.

351
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,915
It's over
at the end of the week.

352
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,876
Just keep you out of trouble
until school starts.

353
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:06,357
I'm not in any trouble.

354
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:11,145
Just to keep you off the streets, you know.

355
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,842
I'm not on the streets.

356
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,411
He's only joking, Lonnie.

357
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:18,892
I know.

358
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,009
Diane.

359
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,401
What?

360
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,844
Can you keep a secret?

361
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,062
Yeah.

362
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,326
I have to tell you a secret.

363
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,024
What?

364
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:07,462
You have to promise
not to tell anyone.

365
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,161
How can I promise
if I don't even know what it is?

366
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,164
You have to or I
can't tell you.

367
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,558
Is it about that girl?

368
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,951
And what if it is?

369
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,343
Then, I'll keep it.

370
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,303
-It is.
-Tell me.

371
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,697
I skipped camp.

372
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,785
I know.

373
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:29,179
And I'm gonna do it again.

374
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,291
What are you doing, honey?

375
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,422
What?

376
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,164
Nothing.

377
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,557
Just sitting.

378
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,996
I got it.

379
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,568
Don't worry, I got it.

380
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,962
Well, if you got it,
then, get it.

381
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,621
Hello?

382
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,623
Yes, it is.

383
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,060
She's still sick.

384
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,633
-Two days?
-Yeah.

385
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,112
All right.

386
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,641
Look what I got.

387
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,946
The passkey.

388
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,600
Could you believe it?
He was right there

389
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,602
in the room, and I got it?

390
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,082
Come on.

391
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,434
What if someone's there?

392
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:35,610
It hasn't been rented yet.

393
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,046
Come on.

394
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,706
What are you doing?

395
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,707
Just looking.

396
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,671
We're just looking,
Mr. Bruckner.

397
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,414
Are utilities included?

398
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,158
You need to fix the plumbing
yourself?

399
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,293
Should we take it, dear?

400
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:06,859
It's roomy,

401
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,950
but it's got a good view
of the garbage cans.

402
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,129
We can put the TV in here.

403
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,566
Yeah.

404
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,222
I'll put the a Tangier over here
and the piano over here,

405
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:25,051
and the Davenport over there.

406
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,924
Are you gonna eat

407
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,144
or are you gonna stare at me
for an hour?

408
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,624
No, no, no, the food's
not on the table yet.

409
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:37,237
Charles, serve the Vichyssoise.

410
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,804
What?

411
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,241
The soup, the Vichyssoise.

412
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,552
It's perfect.

413
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,381
What are you doing?

414
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,818
I'm eating my steak.

415
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,168
It's just the way I like it,
thick and juicy.

416
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,170
No. We're having pressed duck.

417
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,781
Charles, bring us
the pressed duck, please.

418
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,871
Well, what do we got
to drink, Charles?

419
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,786
White wine, please.

420
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,353
White wine?

421
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,789
Yeah.
White wine with poultry.

422
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,095
It's perfect.

423
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,619
I want a chocolate shake,
Charles.

424
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,100
Fine.
Bring her a chocolate shake.

425
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,058
And we'll have bananas flambe
for dessert.

426
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,191
Bananas for dessert?

427
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,888
Yeah. It's very elegant.

428
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:26,721
Your bananas is rotten,
and this whole dinner stinks.

429
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,072
Shh.

430
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:31,813
I think I hear him coming.

431
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,040
Lucky.

432
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,693
Let's get out of here.

433
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,741
Hurry up.

434
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,749
Simple.

435
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:09,242
Go ahead.
I'll be there in a minute.

436
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:15,639
What are you doing?

437
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:16,858
Nothing.

438
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,381
Oh?

439
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,515
-Where is the key?
-I don't got it.

440
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:23,169
I'm showing a new
tenant the apartment,

441
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,519
and I ain't got the key,
so let's have it.

442
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,608
Okay. Okay. Here.

443
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,964
Don't you ever go in
a tenant's apartment again.

444
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,966
-It was empty.
-I don't care.

445
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,707
If I ever catch you
in an apartment again,

446
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,404
you're gonna wish you were
somebody else's kid.

447
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,363
And that goes
for your friend, too.

448
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,556
-Karen.
-Shut up.

449
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,862
Just shut up.

450
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,086
I called Father Stitch.

451
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,699
Where are you going?

452
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,659
You haven't finished.

453
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,443
You didn't confess.

454
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:52,579
Go on.

455
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,042
How can I help you?

456
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,526
What brings you here 
this afternoon?

457
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:31,835
We...

458
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,100
I mean, Kar...

459
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,406
I mean, my friend...

460
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:40,714
Go on.

461
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,072
Scary, huh?

462
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,683
Just stick with me,
them priests is weird,

463
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,033
just stick with me.

464
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:05,130
Haven't you ever been
to confession before?

465
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,697
I've never been
to church before.

466
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,395
You haven't?

467
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,092
Aren't you Catholic?

468
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,267
No.

469
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:15,792
What are you, then?

470
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:18,012
I don't know. Nothing.

471
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,102
What do you mean, nothing?

472
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,408
I'm not anything.

473
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,759
You're gonna go to hell, then.

474
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,717
-What?
-If you're not anything,

475
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,024
you're gonna end up in hell.

476
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,895
You got to confess.

477
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,289
You told the priest
what we did, right?

478
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,160
No.

479
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,206
Oh, boy, you're gonna burn.

480
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,599
Burn?

481
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,427
Burn in the pit of fire.

482
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,254
In the pit of fire?

483
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,693
I mean, just 'cause I didn't
tell a guy what we did?

484
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:50,131
Well, I told him, so I'm okay.

485
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,828
Well, let's go back.

486
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,874
That's not all you got to do.

487
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:55,963
Come on.

488
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,753
I got this at first communion.

489
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:07,148
The one I got now is better,
but it'll do.

490
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,688
Come here.

491
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:30,998
Like this.

492
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,048
No. Left to right.

493
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,924
Okay. Hail Mary--

494
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,230
put your finger...

495
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,668
on that bead there.

496
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:51,627
Okay.

497
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:54,717
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

498
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:56,893
Blessed art thou amongst women,

499
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,809
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

500
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,855
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

501
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,335
pray for us sinners

502
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,903
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

503
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:07,600
Okay?

504
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,559
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

505
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:11,908
Blessed art thou amongst women,

506
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,215
and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

507
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,086
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

508
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,653
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

509
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,177
-Amen.
-Hail Mary, full of grace,

510
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,048
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,

511
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,006
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

512
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,921
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

513
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,706
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

514
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:27,968
Amen.

515
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:30,275
Just keep doing that
every night.

516
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,538
Am I still gonna go to hell?

517
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,017
Who knows?

518
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,019
Just keep praying.

519
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:40,241
Especially when you sin,
and then it'll all be okay.

520
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,112
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

521
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,462
Blessed art thou amongst women,

522
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,507
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

523
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:47,422
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

524
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:50,382
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

525
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,253
I gotta rewire 4C.

526
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:52,993
Yeah?

527
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:59,260
Yeah. And that young lady?
She's taking 3B.

528
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,827
When?
It still needs a cleaning.

529
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,003
-Who?
-Another week.

530
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,571
Who? That lady from before?

531
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,834
Don't put the plate in your
mother's face, she's eating.

532
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,879
-I want some more.
-Well, then ask her if you want.

533
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,620
It's all right. I'll get it.

534
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,276
She said she doesn't
have too much.

535
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,583
A couple of chairs, a bed.

536
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,802
-Just her?
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

537
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,064
She lives alone?

538
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,763
Did you catch that nail polish?

539
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:24,851
Gold.

540
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,332
Would you like some more tomato?

541
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,116
No. Thank you.

542
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,596
Don't you like the food?

543
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,511
Honey, if she doesn't want
any more, it's all right.

544
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:34,034
Well, I know that.
I just asked that.

545
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,296
-Because she wanted the food--
-Dad.

546
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,210
Here comes...

547
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,300
Hey, you haven't finished
your dinner.

548
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,736
I'm gonna meet somebody.

549
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,566
You ask for more and then
you leave it on your plate.

550
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,046
Take it easy, Red Raider.

551
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,874
I ain't gonna steal your food.

552
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,179
Hey, cut it out.

553
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:50,833
Lower your voice.

554
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,618
You shouldn't let
him leave the table like that.

555
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,836
He's a wise guy.

556
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,837
Yeah.

557
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,317
Who asked you?

558
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:08,416
Lonnie?

559
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:10,723
Yeah?

560
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,855
Come on.

561
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,553
Where?

562
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:15,728
Just come on.

563
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,379
Wait here.

564
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,510
Why?

565
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:43,859
Just wait.

566
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,547
Here.

567
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,854
For keeps?

568
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,072
Yeah.

569
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,383
Thanks.

570
00:40:41,395 --> 00:40:43,484
Well, au revoir.

571
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,007
What?

572
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:46,444
It's French for good-bye.

573
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,229
Au revoir?

574
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,361
Right, au revoir.

575
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,060
Au revoir.

576
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:05,506
Hey, your friend ain't bad,
give her a couple of years

577
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,507
and send her by.

578
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,640
You're a pervert.

579
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,206
I hear they ain't letting
you confess

580
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,209
'cause what you've been
telling them is too sick.

581
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,341
Very funny.

582
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,910
Leave her alone.
She likes me.

583
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:19,215
How do you know?

584
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,610
She came over,
she spent the night.

585
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:25,047
How do you know
she wasn't over to see me?

586
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,049
I saw her looking up
at me at dinner.

587
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,921
She likes me.

588
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,618
She don't need you.

589
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,620
Leave her alone, she's mine.

590
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,340
Lonnie?

591
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,433
What are you doing?

592
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,435
I'm sorry.
I didn't mess anything.

593
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,655
-No.
-I'll clean it up.

594
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,528
I didn't know you use make up.

595
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,053
I mean, I didn't know
you were interested

596
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,707
in that kind of stuff.

597
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,579
I'm not. I mean, not really.

598
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:19,972
No, it's okay.

599
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:23,932
I just didn't know, that's all.

600
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:34,421
Oh, this came
for you last week.

601
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:36,249
I forgot to show it to you.

602
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,294
It's the invitation
to the Summer Dance.

603
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:39,774
It's next week.

604
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,863
-Next week?
-Uh-huh.

605
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:44,997
I don't wanna go this year.

606
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,608
Oh, Lonnie,
you loved it last year.

607
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,741
I didn't love it, it was okay.

608
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:51,699
Well, you're going this year.

609
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:55,703
You have to invite someone,
maybe someone from camp.

610
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:56,878
Forget it.

611
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,881
Lonnie, think of someone
and invite them.

612
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,323
Anybody?

613
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,890
Yes, anybody.

614
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,811
Hey, look, there's some kids
from my school.

615
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,336
- Sarah, hi.
- Hi, Lonnie.

616
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:05,860
Come on.

617
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:07,470
This is my friend, Karen.

618
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:09,429
Hi.

619
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,347
She lives near me.

620
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:17,742
What school do you go to,
Ms. Dobson's?

621
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:20,614
Saint Stan's.

622
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,312
It's near us.
It's stuck onto a church.

623
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:24,226
Oh.

624
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:27,839
- Where's Sally?
- Sally's in France.

625
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,275
- Still?
- Yeah.

626
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,759
There's Bobby Jacobs.

627
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:37,370
I wanted to ask him to dance,
but he won't.

628
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,588
That guy?

629
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,375
I wouldn't let him
touch me if I was you.

630
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:43,681
What a stiff.

631
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,554
Do you wanna dance?

632
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,121
Who dances to this?

633
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:52,385
-Come on.
-Don't touch me.

634
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,301
I wanna dance, come on.

635
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,396
Don't you know how to dance?

636
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:06,007
Listen, I was dancing
before you were walking.

637
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,661
Come on, I'll show you.

638
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:09,968
Like this.

639
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,274
Forward, back.

640
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,537
Forward, back.

641
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,544
-Look at that stiff.
-Oh, my God.

642
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,853
What are you staring at?

643
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:30,336
Don't worry about them.
Come on, you almost had it.

644
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:41,216
Hey, are you trying to make me
look like a queer, Sloan?

645
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:41,956
No.

646
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:44,219
Forget it, I don't need it.

647
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:45,525
Check you later.

648
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,714
That was just great,
boys and girls.

649
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,630
Now, get your partners, we're
going to play a cha-cha-cha,

650
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:05,893
everybody knows
how to do the cha-cha.

651
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,808
One, two, three.

652
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:33,399
Hey.

653
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,533
-Hi.
-You look like you need

654
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:40,319
something to drink
with your ice.

655
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,668
Yeah.

656
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:46,020
This stuff won't do anything
for you, though.

657
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:48,675
Too bad I didn't bring
a bottle, you know?

658
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:51,112
Huh?

659
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,461
You know, spike it up,

660
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,377
get some action going around
this funeral home.

661
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,086
Come on, let's go.

662
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:10,305
-Why?
-We're leaving now.

663
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:11,698
-What are you doing?
-Shh, just wait

664
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,178
till we get outside.

665
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,444
What's going on?

666
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,881
Some party.
Couldn't believe them guys.

667
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,883
How old was they, about eight?

668
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:25,364
And those girls, what dogs,

669
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:27,496
"Sally's in France."

670
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,628
Yeah, well--

671
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:31,413
Yeah, well, I showed them.

672
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:32,719
What do you mean?

673
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,418
Where'd you get that?

674
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:37,898
24 bucks.

675
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:39,508
All right.

676
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,336
I don't think that lady
in the coat check room

677
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,468
had such a hot time.

678
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:45,645
She was sleeping
through the whole thing.

679
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,386
You mean you stole that?

680
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:50,868
Yeah, I got it.

681
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,304
You can't do that.

682
00:47:53,783 --> 00:47:56,917
Don't act like you never took
nothing before, Sloan.

683
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,919
It's just like
in the Five & Dime,

684
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:01,052
except a whole lot better.

685
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,967
It's not the same.

686
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,230
Stealing's stealing,

687
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:06,840
and your friends
aren't gonna be missing

688
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,450
a few bucks anyways.

689
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:11,410
You can't do that, not there.

690
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:12,759
What?

691
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:14,152
You can't take that money.

692
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:16,589
You just better watch
what you say to me, Sloan.

693
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,330
Your head's getting
pretty big these days,

694
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:20,723
and I'm getting about ready
not to like you.

695
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,247
What do you mean?

696
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,249
If you wanna keep
hanging around,

697
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,728
you just watch it, is all.

698
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:26,729
Just watch it.

699
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,052
Let's burp you, okay?

700
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:30,489
Big burp, big burp for mommy.

701
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:35,189
Watch out!

702
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:37,235
What?

703
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:39,193
You just fell out of the window.

704
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:44,546
-There.
-You're dead.

705
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,333
Pfft. Now you're not.

706
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,205
Thanks.

707
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,256
Why don't you go
into the living room?

708
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:00,519
I have to be in
with the baby now.

709
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,882
Where's that girl?

710
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:17,753
You don't have to whisper.

711
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:19,755
It's not a secret anymore.

712
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,888
Don't you wanna play
with her anymore?

713
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:24,804
I don't know.

714
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:45,738
Hi.

715
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,523
Hi.

716
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,224
Where you been lately?

717
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:57,097
Here, around.

718
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,929
I thought you were sick
or something.

719
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,324
No, I'm not sick.

720
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,291
I'm sorry about the money.

721
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:22,688
I'm sorry.

722
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:26,953
Okay.

723
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,912
Okay?

724
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:31,653
Yeah, okay.

725
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,178
All right.

726
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:37,920
So you gonna come over
or what?

727
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,669
I want you to come over.

728
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:49,149
You wanna come over?

729
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:51,934
Okay.

730
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:00,160
Where is everyone?

731
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,120
Old lady Kramer
kicked off last night.

732
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,338
She died?

733
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:06,427
Bit the dust, but
didn't come up chewin'.

734
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,433
So where is everyone?

735
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:14,348
Kramer's funeral.

736
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,872
They couldn't wait to stick her
in the dirt.

737
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,787
How come you didn't go?

738
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,313
What do I want
at some old bat's funeral?

739
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,663
Where are you going,
Red Raider?

740
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,186
I don't know.

741
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,840
Just 'cause your best girl
ain't here

742
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:30,321
don't mean
there's nothing to do.

743
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,410
So, what do you wanna do?

744
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:33,672
I got an idea.

745
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,022
What?

746
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,372
Come on, I'll show you.

747
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:42,159
-Tell me.
-It would be a surprise.

748
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,727
Don't you like surprises?

749
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:46,989
Come on.

750
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,181
Sit down.

751
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,097
Sit.

752
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:11,753
You're acting like you
ain't never been here before.

753
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,586
We never got a chance
to talk, you and me, huh?

754
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,504
-Wanna drink?
-Yeah.

755
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,811
Okay.

756
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:33,122
How old are you?

757
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,255
Almost eleven three-quarters.

758
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,865
That's pretty old.

759
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:43,220
So, um...

760
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:45,700
got yourself a boyfriend?

761
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,094
No.

762
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:51,315
How come?

763
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:53,317
I don't know.

764
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:57,146
What do you mean
you don't know?

765
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,148
I don't know.
I guess I'm not ready.

766
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,152
-Look ready to me.
-What?

767
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:08,114
You know, I was ready
when I was your age.

768
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:11,683
Don't you think you're ready?

769
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,729
You wanna play cards?
Karen's got cards.

770
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:15,730
Strip poker?

771
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,210
No.

772
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,387
That's the only game I like.

773
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,171
You know Gin?

774
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:23,129
Gin?

775
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:24,435
Yeah.

776
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,050
Okay. We'll play your game,
but we'll play with my rules.

777
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:34,923
Okay. You've had it, Red Raider.

778
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,403
You're not out yet.

779
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:43,323
If you lay the card I think
you're stupid enough to lay,

780
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,629
you're a long goner.

781
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:59,252
I got you figured out
pretty good, Red.

782
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,214
Gin.

783
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:07,826
No one's beat me yet.

784
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,044
What do you got?

785
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,352
Not bad.

786
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:13,440
I almost had it.

787
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,355
Yeah, but almost ain't
worth shit.

788
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,837
So what are the special rules?

789
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:20,665
Okay.

790
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,144
Put your hand there.

791
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:24,712
-Why?
-Are you asking or playing?

792
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,323
Put your hand there.

793
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,892
Whoever wins

794
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,633
gets to hit the other guy
in the knuckles.

795
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:34,156
Ow!

796
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,767
Oh, come on, I didn't hurt you.

797
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:37,508
I hardly touched you.

798
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,858
You should see what I do
when I play with the guys.

799
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,427
Some of them I smashed
ain't doing much

800
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,037
with their hands these days.

801
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:47,996
Hey, I didn't hurt you, did I?

802
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,701
I'm sorry.

803
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:13,065
We're playing stickball outside.

804
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:16,373
You gonna pitch or what?

805
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,070
Ball?

806
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:19,898
Yeah, sure.

807
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:32,519
I'm changing my clothes.
Meet me outside.

808
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,044
Keep your eye
on the ball, okay?

809
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,568
This is right.
Now, see where it says,

810
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,308
"Bingo every Friday
at 7:15 p.m."?

811
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:41,572
If you swing and you hit
right over that, it's a single.

812
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:43,443
If you hit right over that sign,
it's a double.

813
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,576
And if you hit right over
those arches, it's a triple.

814
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,708
And if you right over
that cross,

815
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:50,450
right over that cross,
it's a home run.

816
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,538
Okay? Okay.

817
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:53,061
So hit one for me,
all right, Red?

818
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,149
Okay. Great.

819
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:55,803
Hey, lay off.

820
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,415
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to her.

821
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,894
Don't listen to him.

822
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,897
Nail one for me, all right, Red?

823
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:04,769
Don't do it.

824
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:06,292
It's okay, I'll play.

825
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,077
Good choice.

826
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,165
Good choice, Red.

827
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,558
All right. Let's go.

828
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:20,741
- Ball one.
- Yo, come on, Johnny.

829
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:22,264
Johnny, what's going on?

830
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,266
That's ball two.

831
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,878
Why don't you watch the ball,
not the pitcher?

832
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,402
You're pitching a walk.

833
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,795
Come on, Johnny.

834
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:31,970
Ball three.

835
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:35,016
Oh, Johnny, man,
you're pitching a walk.

836
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,628
Ball four.

837
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:38,933
Let's play
some real stickball.

838
00:57:38,977 --> 00:57:40,326
What,
are you sweet on her?

839
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:44,635
Pussy-whipped pitcher.

840
00:57:53,992 --> 00:57:55,210
Thank you.

841
00:57:59,084 --> 00:58:00,825
So, who's coming?

842
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:03,567
Oh, I thought
I told you already.

843
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,482
I forgot.

844
00:58:05,525 --> 00:58:06,570
The Drakes.

845
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:08,397
Mr. and Mrs. Sagers.

846
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,574
Remember you met them
in the country?

847
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:13,272
Aunt Linda. That's all.

848
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:17,581
You can come
if you feel like it.

849
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:19,800
No, thanks.

850
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,457
Mom?

851
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,719
Uh-huh?

852
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,853
How come Aunt Linda
comes alone?

853
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,377
Oh, I don't know.

854
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,857
I guess I never know
who she'll like,

855
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,860
so I just don't invite
anybody for her.

856
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,731
Isn't she married?

857
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:41,387
If she were, you'd have probably
heard about it.

858
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,520
You don't tell me everything,
you know.

859
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,611
I'll be sure to tell you
about it if it happens.

860
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:51,092
There's lots you don't tell me.

861
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:53,355
Oh?

862
00:58:54,356 --> 00:58:56,097
Well, what would you like
to know?

863
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:59,100
I don't know.

864
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:05,933
Do you think she's ever...

865
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,762
you know...?

866
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,982
Ever what?

867
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:12,984
Mom!

868
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:15,943
Honey, I don't know what
you're talking about, honestly.

869
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:22,950
You know, been,
like, with a man.

870
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,476
Well, um,
I'm pretty sure she has.

871
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,217
I mean, I've never really
asked her about it,

872
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:32,481
but I'd be willing
to bet on it.

873
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:35,702
But she's not married.

874
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:42,579
Lonnie, lots of single women
go out with lots of men.

875
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,233
That's how they find
the right man.

876
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:46,495
Oh.

877
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,805
She must've had a lot
of boyfriends.

878
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:53,764
She's had her share.

879
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:56,984
When was her first one?

880
00:59:57,028 --> 01:00:00,335
Oh, Linda started pretty young.

881
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:09,562
- Couldn't these guys --?
- Yeah.

882
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,433
Very nice.

883
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:13,131
She's moving in?

884
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:14,915
Yeah. Croner's old place.

885
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,525
Not bad, huh?

886
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:21,052
She's pretty old.

887
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,622
She's alright.

888
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:27,972
Good legs.

889
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,278
Not bad.

890
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:37,459
Not bad by a long shot.

891
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,352
Hey, Carla, let me take them.

892
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:01,832
Thanks, Johnny.

893
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,400
Looks like you're feeding
an army.

894
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,576
Just some friends.

895
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,795
You got lots of friends?

896
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,232
Everybody's got friends.

897
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,452
What kind of friends you got?

898
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:16,585
Same kind you have.
Probably a little older.

899
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:18,805
I ain't got no friends
around here.

900
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:21,112
Just a bunch of assholes.

901
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:22,722
Sorry.
But you know what I mean.

902
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,202
They're all wimps.

903
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:24,811
They'll grow up.

904
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:30,034
I like older people, anyway,
you know, adults.

905
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:31,688
They got, you know, more.

906
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:34,212
More?

907
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:35,953
Yeah, more.

908
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:39,608
Anyway, older people
like me better anyway.

909
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:41,001
Always have.

910
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,046
That so?

911
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,396
Yeah.

912
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:47,225
I guess they think
I'm mature or something.

913
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,748
You look pretty mature.

914
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,576
Yeah? Do you think?

915
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,015
I don't know, I think so.

916
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:59,019
Yeah, Johnny, real mature.

917
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,325
Yeah?

918
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:04,024
Like older people
could go for me?

919
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:07,245
Sure.

920
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,248
Well, what do you know?

921
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:25,002
-Well, thanks.
-Oh, I could take 'em.

922
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,003
Oh, no. It's okay.

923
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,961
Let me take them.
They're heavy.

924
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:29,310
It's a man's job.

925
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:33,097
You're a sweet kid.

926
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:57,164
You can put them on the table.

927
01:02:58,165 --> 01:03:00,167
Come on,
I'm not gonna bite you.

928
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:43,558
I...

929
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:51,479
Thanks.

930
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:55,919
You're a good kid.

931
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,054
Go on.

932
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:06,233
Go on home.
I got some people coming.

933
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:07,844
Oh, yeah. Okay.

934
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:13,153
See you later, little man.

935
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,810
Hey, look,
there's Carla.

936
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,204
Look at the way 
she's dressed.

937
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:21,901
Her pants are so tight.

938
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:25,165
Yeah, she has to
lie down and put them on.

939
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:26,514
You know her already?

940
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:27,907
Yeah,
I know all about her.

941
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,866
I know she's 32.

942
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,998
And I know she works 
in a beauty parlor.

943
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,478
She does nails.

944
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:37,438
-Hi, honey, how are you doing?
-Hi.

945
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:39,049
-Okay.
-Oh, I like your belt. Look.

946
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,965
Let me see your nails.

947
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,009
They look good.

948
01:04:43,618 --> 01:04:44,663
Nice.

949
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,405
See you later.

950
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:48,101
Alright.

951
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:57,284
And I know
she doesn't have any guys.

952
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,938
How did you know?

953
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,940
I'm not stupid, Sloan.

954
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,900
Single women
go out with lots of guys.

955
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,164
That's how they figure out
who's the right one.

956
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:09,253
Well, she told me she doesn't.

957
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,212
Yeah, but I'll bet she does.

958
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:16,042
You don't even know her.

959
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,460
Where did he go?

960
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:44,723
Who?

961
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:45,767
Him.

962
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,508
Your father?

963
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,510
I guess he's up
fixing something.

964
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,036
Fixing what?

965
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,385
I don't know.

966
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,518
He said something
about air-conditioning for 3B.

967
01:05:57,562 --> 01:05:59,607
Well, that's Carla's
new apartment.

968
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:01,087
Mm-hmm.

969
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:02,784
Well, she wants
air-conditioning?

970
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,221
I guess so.

971
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:06,658
Well, we don't have
air-conditioning.

972
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,269
If she wants to pay for it,
she can have it.

973
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:12,838
Oh, fancy.

974
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:14,927
You take care of yourself.

975
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,929
Don't go worrying
about nobody else.

976
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,324
Finished already?

977
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,456
She ain't got the right parts.

978
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,023
She doesn't have
all the right parts?

979
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,111
Yeah.

980
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:30,377
But the one she's got
ain't too bad.

981
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:35,774
It's you.

982
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:37,776
Yeah. Who else?

983
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:40,170
You going in or out?

984
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:43,782
Out, I guess.

985
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:45,914
Okay. See you later, then.

986
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:54,010
Hi, Dad.

987
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:56,186
Hi.

988
01:06:58,188 --> 01:06:59,363
What's up?

989
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,887
Nothing that wasn't up
a minute ago.

990
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,545
You finished
with these tools here?

991
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,155
Yeah.

992
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,289
I've had just about all I can
take with those tools today.

993
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,466
I thought I'd, um--

994
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:17,424
I thought I'd finish
fixing that pipe up on 4,

995
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:18,860
like you wanted me to.

996
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,518
That's good.

997
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,782
You're learning.

998
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:32,483
Are you gonna follow
your old man's footsteps?

999
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:33,658
Yeah. Sure.

1000
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:35,964
Do me a favor.

1001
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:37,401
Don't.

1002
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:16,788
Oh, it's you.

1003
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:17,832
Yeah, it's me.

1004
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,225
Are you expecting somebody else?

1005
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:20,444
No.

1006
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,360
Your dad was just up here.

1007
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:26,711
He's gonna put in
the air-conditioning.

1008
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:31,585
It's gonna be real cool
up, because.

1009
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:33,587
Yeah?

1010
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:36,851
What'd you bring the tools for?

1011
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,463
I don't know.

1012
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,421
I just thought...

1013
01:08:41,465 --> 01:08:45,077
Just thought you'd come
and see how cool it is?

1014
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,557
Yeah, exactly.

1015
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:52,389
There she is.

1016
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,916
Come on.

1017
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:20,504
Jesus.

1018
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:22,941
I think she's walking
to another country.

1019
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:27,772
Come on.
We'll lose her.

1020
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:29,774
Forget it.

1021
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:34,344
Sloan, you're
really stupid sometimes.

1022
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:36,520
You can't go here.

1023
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:37,564
Why not?

1024
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,045
We don't belong here.

1025
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,351
Get it?

1026
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:43,483
We're going back. Now.

1027
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:57,427
Check it out.

1028
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:11,223
Yo, man, check out
this mariquita, man.

1029
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:19,840
Huh?

1030
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,932
How many you want?

1031
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:11,196
One, just one.

1032
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:14,286
Anything else?

1033
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,592
No, that's it.

1034
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:20,597
I mean, 25 cents, please.

1035
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:42,140
You're a fool.

1036
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:45,839
You could have
gotten killed there.

1037
01:12:45,883 --> 01:12:47,363
Yeah, but I didn't.

1038
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:55,762
So you found out
where she works, is that it?

1039
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:57,373
Found out everything.

1040
01:12:58,156 --> 01:12:59,375
She's got a man.

1041
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:01,942
So she's got a man,
that it?

1042
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,640
What else do you wanna know?

1043
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:06,425
I bet there's lots more to know.

1044
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:08,949
Only I don't have to go
anywhere to find it out.

1045
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,347
I got all the information,
not you.

1046
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:28,578
You can't find out anything
without me.

1047
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:32,538
Pretty nice...

1048
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:36,020
air-conditioning and everything.

1049
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,840
I guess she does more
than just talk with that guy.

1050
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:16,016
-What?
-Look at her bed.

1051
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:19,280
Bet you didn't find
anything like this

1052
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,717
up where you went.

1053
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:33,425
Here. Have one of these.

1054
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,822
This is good.

1055
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:41,607
Come on.

1056
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,532
What?

1057
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:54,838
Karen, what's the matter?

1058
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:02,759
My dad's tool belt.

1059
01:15:03,542 --> 01:15:05,413
What's it doing here?

1060
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:11,419
He was putting in
the air-conditioning.

1061
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,421
Well, that's in the other room.

1062
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,514
I know.

1063
01:15:19,776 --> 01:15:21,995
What are his tools doing--?

1064
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:24,607
Oh.

1065
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:29,220
Carla?

1066
01:15:29,263 --> 01:15:30,438
Are you here?

1067
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,092
It's Johnny.

1068
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,361
What are you doing here?

1069
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:42,189
What are you doing here?

1070
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,366
I thought I heard something.

1071
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,673
I mean, I had to check
on some pipes.

1072
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,286
Look at this.

1073
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:58,162
So what?

1074
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:00,381
So what's it doing here?

1075
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:03,646
Well, wasn't dad putting in
the air-conditioner?

1076
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,865
The air-conditioning
is in the other room.

1077
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,173
Wait.

1078
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:14,091
You mean, you think
him and her... up here?

1079
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,182
I don't know.
He's been coming up here a lot.

1080
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:21,577
Well, what do you know?

1081
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:25,450
I never thought the old man
was up to it.

1082
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:27,365
It's not funny.

1083
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,628
What do you know?

1084
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,499
It's not funny.
You think it's funny?

1085
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:33,589
Your own dad up here
with some slut?

1086
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:34,894
She's not a slut!

1087
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,504
Oh, she's a slut, all right.

1088
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,898
-Oh, grow up.
-You grow up.

1089
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,604
We better clean up.

1090
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:55,741
I don't know
where she got this from.

1091
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:57,221
On the hook.

1092
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:11,278
What are you staring at?

1093
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,241
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting out of here.

1094
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:35,694
Don't worry.
She won't be home until 6:00.

1095
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:37,696
How do you know so much
about her?

1096
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:42,005
I talk to her.

1097
01:17:42,048 --> 01:17:44,311
Ain't I allowed to talk to her?

1098
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:53,625
It was you up there,
wasn't it?

1099
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:56,672
What if it was?

1100
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:58,195
Tell Karen.

1101
01:17:58,238 --> 01:17:59,544
Why should I?

1102
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:00,850
She was crying.

1103
01:18:00,893 --> 01:18:02,373
She'll be all right.

1104
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,262
What do you want?

1105
01:18:22,306 --> 01:18:23,699
I have to talk to you.

1106
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,135
Forget it.

1107
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:27,006
I have to tell you something.

1108
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,009
What? That my father was
up there with that slut?

1109
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:30,880
No.

1110
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:32,403
Get out of here.

1111
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:34,710
- Wait a minute.
- Just get out of my house.

1112
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:55,513
Hello? Is Karen home?

1113
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:58,690
It's Lonnie.

1114
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:02,868
She's not?

1115
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:07,177
Oh.

1116
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:11,311
Okay. Bye.

1117
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:51,525
Hail Mary full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1118
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:53,266
Blessed art thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit

1119
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,877
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

1120
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,749
pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of death. Amen.

1121
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,272
Hail Mary full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1122
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:00,926
Blessed art thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit

1123
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,145
of thy womb, Jesus.

1124
01:21:08,646 --> 01:21:09,865
Hey, hey.

1125
01:21:12,128 --> 01:21:14,173
Did you tell her?

1126
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:15,348
No.

1127
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:16,872
Then, I'm gonna tell her.
She should know.

1128
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,569
Hold on.
Hold on.

1129
01:21:18,612 --> 01:21:22,529
I, um...
I didn't get a chance to yet.

1130
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:24,270
You see,

1131
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:26,882
I thought maybe you'd help me
figure out how to tell her.

1132
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:28,274
Well, just say that it was you.

1133
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:29,362
No, no, no.

1134
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:32,191
Not here.
Come here.

1135
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:34,237
Come on, Red.
I'm not gonna to bite you.

1136
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,542
Wanna go for a ride, Red?

1137
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:36,892
-No.
-Come on.

1138
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:37,936
Get on.

1139
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:39,982
I don't wanna do this!

1140
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,113
Too bad.

1141
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:44,421
Let me off!

1142
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,465
Look out!

1143
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,715
Watch out!

1144
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:21,197
Pretty scary, huh?

1145
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,546
Stop it!
I wanna get off!

1146
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:23,764
No way.

1147
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:24,852
Stop it!

1148
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,593
Forget about it!

1149
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:29,031
Look out!

1150
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:34,514
-Let me off!
-No.

1151
01:22:34,558 --> 01:22:35,646
Look out!

1152
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:40,216
Stop!

1153
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,354
You keep your face
out of other people's business.

1154
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:50,008
You got that?
This is nothing compared

1155
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:52,141
to what I'm gonna do to you
if you tell Karen.

1156
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:53,359
Do you hear me?

1157
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:55,144
-Yeah.
-What?

1158
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:56,275
Yeah, I hear you.

1159
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:58,060
So you just keep it to yourself!

1160
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:00,018
Keep what to herself?

1161
01:23:01,498 --> 01:23:02,847
Keep what to yourself?

1162
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:06,285
It was Johnny who was up there
with Carla.

1163
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:07,765
It's not your father.

1164
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:10,202
You?

1165
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:12,465
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

1166
01:23:12,509 --> 01:23:14,380
What are you so surprised for?

1167
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:16,034
I thought it was Dad.

1168
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:18,210
Well, it wasn't.
Anyway, you're too busy

1169
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,559
with your friend here
all the time

1170
01:23:19,603 --> 01:23:22,649
to see what's going on
in your own damn house!

1171
01:23:22,693 --> 01:23:24,825
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

1172
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:29,395
-It's all your fault.
-What?

1173
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:30,918
You had to know everything,

1174
01:23:30,962 --> 01:23:32,790
and you had to know
all about her.

1175
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:34,226
I tried to tell you.

1176
01:23:35,227 --> 01:23:36,707
You mean you knew?

1177
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,318
You knew all along,
and you didn't even tell me?

1178
01:23:39,362 --> 01:23:40,711
I tried.

1179
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:43,105
Just go home.
Just get out of here.

1180
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:44,845
Aren't you going to go home
to your mommy?

1181
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:47,196
Ain't your maid waiting
to open the door for you?

1182
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:48,936
-Shut up.
-What?

1183
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,155
I said shut up.

1184
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:06,258
Yes?

1185
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:09,261
It's me.

1186
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:11,220
Hi, honey.

1187
01:24:15,137 --> 01:24:16,616
You can come in.

1188
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:38,725
You want anything?

1189
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,773
No.

1190
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:51,608
Daddy and I are going to dinner,
so it's just you and Diane.

1191
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,436
You're going out?

1192
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:54,480
Yes.

1193
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,137
Your top is undone,
you know.

1194
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:01,879
Oh.

1195
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:05,622
Don't you want to do it up?

1196
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:07,319
Oh, I'll get to it.

1197
01:25:09,713 --> 01:25:11,149
I'll do it.

1198
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:13,760
Can I do it?

1199
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:17,155
Okay. That would be nice.

1200
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,952
Lonnie?

1201
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:41,310
What's wrong?

1202
01:25:49,231 --> 01:25:50,971
Tell me what's wrong.

1203
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:56,325
First day
of school tomorrow, huh?

1204
01:25:58,109 --> 01:25:59,980
Diane's so excited,
you're gonna have a great time

1205
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:01,852
getting her to go to bed.

1206
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:08,511
You had a good summer, huh?

1207
01:26:08,554 --> 01:26:10,252
Yeah.

1208
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:14,212
Oh, Lonnie.

1209
01:26:17,868 --> 01:26:19,086
Look.

1210
01:26:22,264 --> 01:26:24,962
You have
the most beautiful eyes.

1211
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:45,635
Hurry up.

1212
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:47,854
I'll come when I'm ready.

1213
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:49,813
What are you doing?

1214
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:54,774
You're not allowed.
It's not in the dress code.

1215
01:27:00,693 --> 01:27:02,173
Nice, huh?

1216
01:27:05,132 --> 01:27:06,699
I hate these uniforms.

1217
01:27:06,743 --> 01:27:08,527
I like them.

1218
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:10,573
It's so stupid.

1219
01:27:10,616 --> 01:27:12,270
Colors are nice.

1220
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:13,706
I'd rather be purple.

1221
01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:17,449
There's that girl.

1222
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:20,974
So?

1223
01:27:21,018 --> 01:27:23,412
She's coming over here.

1224
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,253
Hi.

1225
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:40,820
Hi.

1226
01:27:42,822 --> 01:27:44,171
First day?

1227
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,391
Yeah.

1228
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,307
School.

1229
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:50,961
Yeah.

1230
01:28:03,147 --> 01:28:06,150
Summer was better than this
is ever gonna be.

1231
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,893
I mean, it's not like it was--
it was different

1232
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:11,547
than other summers.

1233
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:14,201
Just hanging around and stuff.

1234
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:15,812
It was different.

1235
01:28:17,074 --> 01:28:18,423
Yeah, I know.

1236
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:27,650
I got to go, anyway.

1237
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:30,870
Yeah.

1238
01:28:30,914 --> 01:28:33,960
Well, I'll see you around?

1239
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:35,701
I guess.

1240
01:28:35,745 --> 01:28:38,138
Hey, Karen, let's go!

1241
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:44,928
Hey, Sloan!

1242
01:28:44,971 --> 01:28:46,321
Your color...

1243
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:47,452
It's good.

1244
01:28:48,888 --> 01:28:51,761
I mean, this fiery red
you copped for me is better.

1245
01:28:51,804 --> 01:28:53,719
But what you got's okay.

1246
01:28:54,764 --> 01:28:57,114
Yeah, I like it.
