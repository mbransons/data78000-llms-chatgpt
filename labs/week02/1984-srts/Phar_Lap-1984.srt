Yes.

What does it matter? He's dead.

that there's been this incredible
reaction to Phar Lap's death?

Harry, you got the real horse hidden
round the back somewhere, right?

unseen from a goddamn catalogue.

Now, I'll tell you the truth -

I don't really care who he's got
in his family tree.

Why the hell didn't you write
across to New Zealand,

ask somebody to look at him for you?

112

Did not win a single race,
either one of them.

00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,394
Well, he's got good blood
further back.

120
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,154
Now, no-one looks further back.

121
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:51,434
Sell him.
But you've gotta give him a chance.

122
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:55,274
Why? I'm not paying you to feed and
train something that looks like that.

I'm not in the habit of throwing
good money after bad, my friend.

124
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:00,474
Well, if you sell him without giving
him a chance you're a fool.

00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:02,674
I assure you I'm no fool.

126
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:06,554
Sell him for the best price
you can get.

127
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,987
I'll lease him, then.

128
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,343
Well, I can't buy him.
Haven't got the money.

You sign him over to me for three
years, I'll pay for his upkeep.

00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,994
Give you a third of his winnings.

Three years?

132
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,874
Well, if you're so bloody sure
he's a no-hoper,

00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,387
what have you got to lose?

134

What have I got to lose?

00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,314
How can we afford to
lease him, Harry?

You just scoot out the back.

139

You've got about as much faith
in me as Davis.

Ta. Ta.

163
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:06,432
Good, mate.

164
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:14,874
Thas it.

165
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:16,466
Ready.

166
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:19,472
(All cheer)

167
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,474
(Man laughs) You got a real goer
this time, Harry.

168
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,954
Jeez, you can pick 'em, Harry.

169
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:31,634
Harry knows his blood lines.

170
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,714
I s'pose you'd pick one
like that for me.

171
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,354
HARRY: Go on, you bloody mongrel!
Get away.

172
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:39,152
(All laugh)

173
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,834
(Foreign accent) Excuse me.
What is that horse's name?

174
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,714
Milkal's Galloping Giraffe.

175
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,194
Cattle.
Rocket.

176
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,314
How about Lightning?
(All laugh)

177
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,034
Mr Ping, whas the word
for 'lightning' in your lingo?

178
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:53,514
Farlap.
Got a name for the colt, Harry.

179
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,994
Lay off, McCready.

180
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:56,834
No, seriously. Pingy reckons
is really lucky.

181
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,114
I'll write it down
for you, Mr Telford.

182
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,547
Very lucky.

183
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,194
Gotta have seven letters.

184
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,994
Last four Melbourne Cup winners
had seven letters.

185
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:13,554
Melbourne Cup? You've
gotta be joking.

186
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,823
Yes, Mr Telford. Seven letters.

187
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,987
Phar Lap it is.

188
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,754
Take the bloody thing
back to the stables.

189
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,187
(All laugh)

190
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:31,273
Go, Lightning!
Good one, Lightning.

191
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,434
(Reads) "So the king saw
the beautiful girl

192
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,470
"with the golden star
upon her brow..."

193
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,794
"...and was so enchanted
with her beauty

194
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:45,354
"that he asked if she would
become his bride."

195
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,265
Here's Daddy.

196
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,314
Whas wrong?

197
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:53,754
(Sighs) Oh, he's lazy.

198
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,234
Bone lazy.

199
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,754
Still won't run.

200
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,394
Oh, give up on him, Harry. Sell him.

201
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,434
I'm not gonna give him
that satisfaction.

202
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:04,426
He's going to learn to work hard
even if it kills me.

203
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:44,987
(Groans)

204
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,432
(Pants)

205
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,546
You poor little beggar.

206
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,594
Whoa, matey.

207
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,391
Whoa, matey.

208
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,747
Whoa, mate.

209
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,507
You'll be alright, mate. Hold on.

210
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:20,954
Hold on.

211
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,229
You'll be right. Hold on, matey.

212
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,954
(Groans)

213
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,554
Get up. Come on!

214
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:31,074
Get yourself up.

215
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,554
Thas a boy.

216
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:35,830
Ooh. You're alright, are ya?

217
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,590
Just worked into
the bloody ground, eh?

218
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,034
I can't pay you this week, Tommy.

219
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,874
Just have to wait till I have a win.

220
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,354
I didn't come about that.

221
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,034
I've just seen Phar Lap.

222
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:18,634
Oh, yeah.

223
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,794
He shouldn't have been
left like that, boss.

224
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,227
He looks half-dead.

225
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,230
And I don't think you should
work him so hard.

226
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,994
There's one thing
I don't tolerate, sonny -

227
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,792
stable hands who tell me
how to do my job.

228
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,874
Now, pack your things and clear out.

229
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,554
I was just worried about the horse!

230
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,034
Hard work never killed any horse!

231
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,274
If a few more trainers cottoned on
to that they might do a lot better.

232
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,707
Now, pack your things and get.

233
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,354
And all you said was
that he looked half-dead?

234
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:54,274
(All complain)

235
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:57,034
I reckon is just not fair.

236
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:59,434
Keep your nose out of it, Emma,
is none of your business.

237
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,034
But he is killing the horse, Missus.

238
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:04,554
Lazy horses are like lazy people -
they have to be jolted out of it.

239
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,749
Now take your places, please.
Don't let your food go cold.

240
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,474
ALL: For what we are about to receive

241
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,434
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

242
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,867
Amen.

243
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:33,107
How's it going, boss?
G'day, boss.

244
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,667
Mr Telford!

245
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:39,914
Boss.
Hey, boss.

246
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:41,984
Don't go back up the bush, Tommy.

247
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,272
Some other trainer will give you a job.

248
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,072
Not when they hear I got the sack.

249
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:50,787
Yes, they will, Tommy.

250
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:54,114
They know what old Telforÿs like.

251
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,434
Enough of that.

252
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,194
Mr Telforÿs here to see you, Tommy.

253
00:16:58,194 --> 00:16:59,627
He's out on the porch.

254
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:12,272
Whas going on between
you and young Tommy?

255
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:15,863
Nothing, Mum.
Better not be.

256
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:20,987
Boss?

257
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,347
What have you done to that horse?

258
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:27,467
Spoiled him rotten.

259
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,074
Anyone goes near him
he rips their bloody shirt off.

260
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:32,507
He won't eat, he won't...

261
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,744
Now, get back to the
stables. Get him fed.

262
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,594
Reckon I got my job back.

263
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:47,554
Gee, he's a rude old cow.

264
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:48,987
I wouldn't go back.

265
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:53,034
Better go. Bobby will fret.

266
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,514
Bobby?

267
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:55,947
Phar Lap.

268
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,067
See you later.

269
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,752
(Announcer calls race)

270
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,114
Those beggars who
reckon you can't run

271
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:28,874
are gonna get a shock today,
eh, old fella?

272
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,354
He's really starting to fill out, boss.

273
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:33,394
Hard work - puts muscle on.

274
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:35,794
Are you gonna watch the race?

275
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:37,227
I'll listen from down here.

276
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,514
Oh, don't give him more sugar!

277
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:43,153
He'll die of bloody diabetes
before his first race.

278
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:49,114
Harry, say hello to Mrs Davis.

279
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:51,634
Harry Telford.
How do you do?

280
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:54,234
OK, les take a look at him.

281
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,034
You said he was as ugly as a camel.

282
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,434
DAVIS: You should have
seen him a year ago.

283
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:01,914
So, I understand his training times
have been better recently, yeah?

284
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:03,984
When he's ridden hard.
He's still lazy.

285
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,954
Have YOU put any money on him?

286
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,794
I don't bet.
I see.

287
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:12,034
You're not exactly
oozing confidence, are ya?

288
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,634
I don't think I'll bet on him either.

289
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:17,354
Oh, I'm gonna have a bet on him.
Yeah? (Laughs)

290
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:20,594
Whas your name?
Tom Woodcock, ma'am.

291
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,394
I'm Phar Lap's strapper.

292
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,544
Do you think he'll win, Tom?
I reckon he will.

293
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,954
RACE CALLER: As they pass
the 3-furlong post,

294
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,434
and Exact is the leader,

295
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,674
about a length and a half
in front of Memento.

296
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,954
Then Phar Lap, the newcomer,
the big red horse,

297
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:35,434
moving up on the outside.

298
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,914
Cabaret Girl on the inside of him,
followed then by Busham

299
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:40,674
and Rose Flight.

300
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:44,754
Coming up towards the home turn,
Phar Lap, rider having great trouble,

301
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:46,274
and Exact has kicked away -

302
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,714
about four to five lengths
in front of Cabaret Girl,

303
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:51,554
who's starting to make up ground,
with Memento on the inside.

304
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:55,234
And Phar Lap looks as if he is
going to hit the outside fence.

305
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,514
As they straighten up for
the run to the judge now

306
00:19:57,514 --> 00:20:00,194
and Exact is four to five
lengths in front of Memento,

307
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:02,554
and Cabaret Girl
moving up on the outside,

308
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,594
and Phar Lap still racing wide.

309
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,834
With half a furlong
to go is all Exact,

310
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,674
and Exact is going to win easily

311
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,674
about two lengths
in front of Cabaret Girl.

312
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:14,434
Memento third, a long distance then
to Busham from Rose Flight,

313
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:16,106
and Phar Lap ran last.

314
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,994
Do you like it?
Here, listen to this.

315
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,554
(Reads) "The big 2-year-old Phar Lad..."

316
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,154
They can't even get
the horse's name right.

317
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:38,594
"...enhanced his reputation
for consistency

318
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,744
"by finishing last yet again."

319
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:45,023
He's a real smart guy,
this Bert Wolfe, huh?

320
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,107
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

321
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,349
Gorgeous.

322
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:54,828
There's a boy.

323
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:58,873
Go on, let me get on
with it. Go on.

324
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,507
Alright, up we go.

325
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:25,474
Tommy.

326
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,274
You can take Phar Lap
out this morning.

327
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,026
I'm taking young Cappy
for a ride on Sally.

328
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:32,827
And work him hard.

329
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,585
How's Lightning, Tommy?
Good.

330
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:42,594
Harry given up on him, has he?
Yeah, he's still in bed.

331
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,074
(All laugh)

332
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:46,110
You better hang onto him,
he might take off.

333
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,834
I wanna try something different
this morning, Cashy.

334
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:54,834
I'll hold Bobby back then see if
I can get him to go out after you.

335
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,594
Whas the sense of that?
We'll just try it.

336
00:21:57,594 --> 00:21:59,027
He's gotta learn to be a winner.

337
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:34,634
After him now!

338
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,067
Don't let him get away.

339
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:44,629
Yes!

340
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,747
Whoo!

341
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,034
You beauty.

342
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,467
Good on you, mate.

343
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,262
Alright, Cashy, les try that again.

344
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:14,754
Off with your cap.

345
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,754
Thas a good fella.

346
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:18,474
Yeah. Up we go.

347
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,274
Did he like it?

348
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:22,114
Yeah, he's a regular
little horseman here.

349
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:24,034
Did Daddy take you
on the big horsey?

350
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,394
Yeah.
(Laughs) I bet you're hungry.

351
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,954
(Laughs)
Are you hungry? Mmm.

352
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:30,714
We'll take your shoes and socks off.

353
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:32,352
Whas all this?

354
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,746
I thought I told you
to stop all that.

355
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:38,274
We needed the money.

356
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:42,062
Well, send 'em back. We can manage
without you being a servant.

357
00:24:44,074 --> 00:24:45,951
How, Harry?
We can MANAGE.

358
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,349
Harry, I'm sick to death of
struggling for every penny.

359
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:04,794
I won't have you taking
in laundry. We'll manage.

360
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,705
How - Phar Lap?

361
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,747
He'll come good. He's got Carbine
on both sides of his blood line.

362
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:15,227
Harry, people are laughing at you.

363
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:18,153
He's hopeless. He's a dud.

364
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,434
Thas right - he's flying, Mr Davis.

365
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:51,794
Yeah, I always knew he'd come good.

366
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:53,794
Just needed a lot of
hard work put into him.

367
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:57,343
I've knocked that lazy streak
out of him at last.

368
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,634
No, no, you wait till
you see him next time.

369
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,114
(Men laugh)

370
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:04,714
MAN: The first race I ever rode
was on one of Reg's horses.

371
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:07,114
"Do you reckon I got a chance?"
I said. "Yeah," he said.

372
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:09,434
"The five other jockeys have
backed you for a fortune."

373
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,389
(Men laugh)

374
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,954
Could I have a word
with you in private, Jim?

375
00:26:13,954 --> 00:26:15,754
You can talk in front
of these blokes, Harry.

376
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,794
If they hear it direct
they can't spread any rumours.

377
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,874
I've got a good horse
for you, for the Derby.

378
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:23,674
Yeah? Who?
Phar Lap.

379
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:25,474
I reckon I'm fixed up
for the Derby, Harry.

380
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:26,907
But I'll keep it in mind.

381
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,665
Phar Lap - he's gotta be joking.

382
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:03,714
DAVIS: Harry, the best horses in the
country are entered into the Derby.

383
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,954
Now, I know you're convinced
the horse has improved,

384
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:08,114
but, Harry, for Chriss sake,
we're talking about the Derby.

385
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,154
I'll be back in a second, honey. Sorry.

386
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:12,514
I'm hoping to get Jim Pike.

387
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,194
Jim Pike?

388
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:15,994
Now I know you're dreaming.

389
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,474
Why would Jim Pike
wanna ride Phar Lap?

390
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:20,434
Huh?
He said he'd keep him in mind.

391
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:21,867
Come on, he was being polite.

392
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:25,714
Look, Harry, you wanna
enter him, you enter him.

393
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:28,831
But you make sure you do it
under your name... not mine.

394
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,474
I'm not gonna be humiliated

395
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:34,074
in front of all the top owners
in this country, believe me.

396
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:35,553
I need 30 quid to enter him.

397
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:38,427
Oh, boy.

398
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,754
You wanna enter him,
you find the money.

399
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:43,914
That was part of our deal, right?

400
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,347
I tried.

401
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,149
Then I'm in very good company
when I say no, hmm?

402
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,947
Harry...

403
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:02,914
...alright, you can have the money.

404
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,994
On two conditions -

405
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:06,950
one, you don't use my name...

406
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,869
...and two, if that horse doesn't
race well this time we sell him.

407
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,754
Race well? He's gotta win.

408
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:18,666
I owe more than 300 quid
and I can't pay my rent.

409
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,154
Pity Pike's lost his mount.

410
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:04,234
Masterful horseman -
compulsive gambler, though.

411
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,634
Good luck in the Derby, Mr McKinnon.

412
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,114
Oh, well, thank you.

413
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,114
We think we'll give you
a run for your money.

414
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:12,434
You've got a horse
in the Derby, Mrs... er...

415
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:15,154
Davis. My husband, David.
How do you do?

416
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,587
Sir Samuel Hordern.

417
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,907
Sir Samuel.
Yes, we have - Phar Lap.

418
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,794
I don't believe I've heard of him.

419
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:28,474
You probably wouldn't. He,
er... he's just in for the run.

420
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,074
And we think he'll win.

421
00:29:30,074 --> 00:29:32,834
And where did you get him?
New Zealand.

422
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,754
For L 168, quite a bargain.

423
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,314
Isn't your horse a New Zealander?

424
00:29:37,314 --> 00:29:39,669
Carradale, yes, he is.

425
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:45,474
Who in the blazes were they?

426
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:48,114
Pushy little Jew. Sells dinnerware.

427
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,914
Door to door.

428
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:53,074
Knows nothing about horses.
He's not a member, is he?

429
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,314
Hard to keep them out these days.

430
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:57,074
Handsome woman, though.

431
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,394
Did you have to do that?
What?

432
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,634
McKinnon practically runs
racing in this country.

433
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,714
Did you have to tell him
what Phar Lap cost?

434
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:06,989
He paid 10 times that much
for Carradale.

435
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,074
Mrs Davis.

436
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,507
What do you think, Tommy?

437
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,914
There's some good horses
out there today, Mrs Davis.

438
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:47,667
My husband will tell me I'm a fool,
but I'm gonna back him anyway.

439
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:53,268
Does Mr Telford always
get that nervous?

440
00:30:57,114 --> 00:31:00,434
If Bobby doesn't win today,
he's finished.

441
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:01,867
Suppose I am too.

442
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,234
I've been looking for you, Harry.

443
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:32,034
My horse for the Derby's
been scratched.

444
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,514
Flies when he's fit,

445
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:36,354
but if there's a germ between
here and Perth he'll pick it up.

446
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,912
Would you like me to ride Phar Lap?

447
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:47,434
L20?

448
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:49,434
You bet L20...?

449
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:51,194
Bea, you're crazy, you know that?

450
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:52,914
Why? Why did you do that?

451
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:54,874
I just felt lucky.

452
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:56,354
RACE CALLER: Ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:57,954
there has been a
late change of rider.

454
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:01,674
Number two, Phar Lap, will
now be ridden by J. Pike.

455
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:03,630
(MURMURS OF ASTONISHMENT)

456
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:07,069
Go!

457
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,194
RACE CALLER: They're off
in the AJC Derby,

458
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,034
and Carradale was one
of the best to begin

459
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:14,474
and is being ridden hard
to the lead in the early stages,

460
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,514
while Phar Lap has
missed the start badly,

461
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:18,554
he's last as they settle down.

462
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:21,554
L20. (Laughs)

463
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:23,154
RACE CALLER: Carradale
crossed over the rails

464
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:25,554
to lead about a length and a half
to Honour and Toper.

465
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:28,874
They were followed by Cathmar,
Comanche, Lorason, Pentheus,

466
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:30,354
Nedda, Queen Nassau and Phar Lap.

467
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:32,954
As they race down to the straight
and the leader is Carradale,

468
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,954
a length and a half
to the good of Toper.

469
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,554
Honour is next, over on the rails.

470
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,434
They were followed further back
by Sir Ribble and Lorason,

471
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:43,234
then Pentheus and Nedda, Queen
Nassau, and Phar Lap is still last.

472
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,034
They race towards the back
and Carradale kicked away.

473
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,554
Is Carradale...

(CROWD DROWNS OUT
RACE CALLER)

475
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,554
Sir Ribble next, on the
outside of Comanche.

476
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,754
And Phar Lap is still
on the tail of the field.

477
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:57,234
Lorason ahead of him, with
Pentheus, Nedda and Queen Nassau.

478
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:59,702
But Carradale shows the way in front.
Go!

479
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:03,754
Here's Phar Lap going
around them quickly now

480
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,234
about three or four deep.

481
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,383
Go, Bobby!

482
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,474
But here's Phar Lap
coming quickly now.

483
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:14,154
Comanche's back in midfield.

484
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:17,074
Carradale in front, but here's
Phar Lap going up very quickly now.

485
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:18,029
Go, Bobby! Go!

486
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,154
Carradale and Phar Lap,
they're locked together

487
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:23,194
head and head as they
race towards the turn.

488
00:33:23,194 --> 00:33:25,874
Carradale on the inside,
and Phar Lap on the outside.

489
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:27,994
And they've moved away
about three lengths further,

490
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:29,714
followed by Toper and Cathmar.

491
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:31,634
Phar Lap on the outside of Carradale.

492
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,954
Pike says, "Go now," and Phar Lap
races to the lead in the Derby.

493
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:38,034
About two or three lengths
to the good of Cathmar.

494
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:41,874
But the big red horse, Phar Lap,
he's racing away with the AJC Derby.

495
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,307
Is Phar Lap's Derby.

496
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:57,394
But is Phar Lap's Derby,
he's won the Derby very easily.

497
00:33:57,394 --> 00:34:00,714
You'll find that the winner will
be Phar Lap, ridden by Jim Pike,

498
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:03,514
second will be Carradale,
and third will be Honour.

499
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,914
After the 1929 AJC Derby...

500
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:08,109
Come on, boss, you've
gotta get the sash!

501
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,427
I can't, Tommy.

502
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:16,664
(Sobs) I can't.

503
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,594
RACE CALLER: Number two, Phar Lap,
J. Pike, the winner.

504
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,514
Second was number nine, Carradale...

505
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,106
Don't say I didn't
warn you, Mr McKinnon.

506
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:32,754
Congratulations, Mrs... er...
Davis.

507
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,994
...Davis.

508
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:35,914
Promising horse.

509
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,674
It will be interesting
to see how he performs

510
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:40,426
when he gets a decent
weight on his back.

511
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,314
Davis?
Yes?

512
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:52,114
Ah... gentlemen.

513
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:55,154
Is it true you've always thought
the horse wasn't any good?

514
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:56,634
(Stammers) Er, no.

515
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,714
Who told you that?

516
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:01,394
Is a story going around.
Well, there's no truth to it.

517
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,474
I've had utter faith in this
horse from the very beginning.

518
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:06,351
Then why did you lease him
to Harry Telford?

519
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,154
Oh, because Mr Telford
found the horse

520
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:11,754
and I thought it was only fair.

521
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:16,234
Now, I want to make it clear that
I've had absolute faith in this horse

522
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:19,674
from the very first moment
I laid eyes upon him.

523
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:22,114
I suppose you had a
lot of money on him, then.

524
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:24,025
Well, er...
We did quite well.

525
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:26,594
Thank you.

526
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:30,382
Vl: L 7,135.

527
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:34,030
Well, a third of it
has to go to Davis.

528
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,274
Oh, Harry, les put it
into something safe.

529
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:40,074
Your brother reckons
we should buy a property.

530
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:42,030
(Scoffs) I can't raise sheep.

531
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,954
You said it yourself a dozen times -
that training's a rotten life.

532
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,474
Oh, yeah, well, it is.

533
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:51,834
When you've just got a few
hacks stuck in rented stables.

534
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,514
I'm gonna have my own place now,
love, and run things my way.

535
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,674
And Cappy and I will see even
less of you than we do now.

536
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:00,714
Well, what do you think
is like for us, Harry?

537
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:02,194
You're up at 3:30 every morning

538
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,994
and by the afternoon
you're dead on your feet.

539
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:05,474
What do you expect me to do -

540
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:07,908
slink back to the bush just
when I finally get my chance?

541
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,747
Sorry, love.

542
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:24,262
Look... Phar Lap wasn't
a fluke, you know.

543
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:27,754
I picked him from the blood lines

544
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:29,234
and I persevered with him

545
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,792
while every other trainer
was laughing at me.

546
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:34,187
No-one's laughing now.

547
00:36:35,474 --> 00:36:37,714
You've proved your point.

548
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:39,147
Hmm.

549
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,147
I haven't even begun.

550
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:47,994
I know more about
blood lines and training

551
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:49,586
than any other bastard
in this country.

552
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:52,787
And by the time I've finished...

553
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:56,470
...they'll all know it.

554
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:01,188
RACE CALLER: And the big red,
Phar Lap, has burst away.

555
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:09,314
But now here comes the big red
down the centre of the track -

556
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,674
Phar Lap, he's starting
to storm home out wide.

557
00:37:11,674 --> 00:37:13,914
Phar Lap races up
and goes to the lead,

558
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:16,189
and is another effortless
victory for Phar Lap.

559
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:21,714
MAN ON RADIO: The Wall Street
stock market crash

560
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:23,874
has caused a crisis
in the American economy.

561
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:28,470
The 3-year-old racehorse Phar Lap
continues his run of good luck.

562
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,434
PIKE: The best I ever rode.

563
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:36,034
In fact, I don't think
there ever was his equal.

564
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,074
Certainly not during my time.

565
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:40,114
RACE CALLER: Phar Lap is dashing
well clear of the opposition.

566
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:42,314
He's racing away,
nothing can catch him.

567
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:44,191
And don't the Victorian
crowd love it?

568
00:37:57,874 --> 00:37:59,954
MAN: I've got nothing against
Telford or even Davis.

569
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:03,074
But les face it - they're not
going to put any time and effort

570
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,674
back into the sport
like we're doing.

571
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,234
Exactly.

572
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,314
They've just happened on a horse
with very indifferent breeding

573
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:10,754
and a freakish turn of speed.

574
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,506
And they're entering him
in everything for the money.

575
00:38:14,354 --> 00:38:16,993
MAN: Phar Lap, most sensational
Australian galloper of all time.

576
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:23,714
Record-breaking streak -
four wins and L 4,000 in a fortnight.

577
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:25,914
MAN 2: This has been an
amazing week for Phar Lap.

578
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:29,514
He's been entered in three
major VRC races and won the lot.

579
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:30,994
What a horse!

580
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:33,114
MAN 3: Pike says is
Phar Lap's phenomenal speed

581
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:35,867
that makes him so superior
to all other horses.

582
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:39,274
MAN: They just happen to
be killing horseracing.

583
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:40,754
A lot of my friends are saying

584
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:42,994
is not worth putting
their horses against Phar Lap.

585
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:44,634
And the bookmakers won't take bets.

586
00:38:44,634 --> 00:38:47,273
Well, the way Telforÿs
overracing and overtraining him...

587
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:50,470
...he can't have too many
more wins left in him.

588
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:54,914
RACE CALLER: Is Phar Lap. Pike's
letting the champion have his head.

589
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:58,509
He's racing away. Nothing
can stop the 'Red Terror'.

590
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:03,467
Kick him along! Come on!

591
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:07,954
NEWSREEL: He's surely
a horse and a half.

592
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:11,074
The Red Terror - here
he is in action again,

593
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,874
only cantering this time.

594
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:15,674
Our cameraman is racing after him,
but he's getting away.

595
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:18,034
After him, Malcolm Campbell,
or you'll lose him!

596
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:21,914
The sand roll, and
how Phar Lap enjoys it.

597
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:25,594
"Rolls the wriggles out," he tells
the stableboy, young Tommy Woodcock.

598
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:28,825
"Come here, sir, I want
my sugar. I've earned it."

599
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,467
Oh, what a horse!

600
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:34,714
Back to work, go on.

601
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:36,272
Come on, get that
contraption out of here.

602
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:45,994
Harry...

603
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:47,874
...this is Eric Connolly.

604
00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:49,546
Harry.
I know.

605
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,274
Ah...

606
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:58,554
...Harry...

607
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:01,194
...Eric's been kind enough
to offer some suggestions

608
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:03,274
about managing Phar Lap's career.

609
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:05,274
(Laughs)

610
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:07,194
I'll bet he has.

611
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:09,913
Which races the horse is allowed
to win and which ones he's not.

612
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:12,947
Stake money, Harry...

613
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,714
...peanuts.

614
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:18,148
Compared with what you could make
with a few well-placed bets.

615
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,394
When I train horses, Connolly,
I train them to win.

616
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:26,192
Pulling horses is not in my line.

617
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,034
Do you understand that we could make

618
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:35,954
an extraordinary amount
of money here?

619
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:38,194
I'm doing alright.
But I'm not.

620
00:40:38,194 --> 00:40:41,074
Well, thas your problem.
Now get outta here!

621
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:42,507
I've got work to do.

622
00:40:55,874 --> 00:40:57,354
Whas wrong with you?

623
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,994
He's being worked too hard, boss.

624
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:01,794
Are you telling me
I don't know my job?

625
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:03,434
He's worn out.

626
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:04,914
Then how come he's still winning?

627
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:07,554
He'd win if he was half-dead.

628
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:10,546
If you keep him racing and training
like this you'll burn him out.

629
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:13,474
You know your trouble, sonny?

630
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:15,954
You think horses are human.

631
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:17,554
Well, I've been around
long enough to know

632
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:19,034
that if you treat 'em too soft

633
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:20,634
they'll take advantage
of you every time.

634
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:23,194
Now, if you want to come
with me and your beloved Bobby

635
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:24,834
when we go to Melbourne

636
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,984
you just better button your lip
and do what you're told.

637
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,994
And I'll top-dress all the paddocks.

638
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:33,754
We'll have grass greener
than you've ever seen it.

639
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:38,194
The marshes over there, full
of birds - snipe, everything.

640
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:39,627
Do you like it?

641
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:43,114
It could do with a
few more trees over here.

642
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:45,114
Well, we'll plant them. (Laughs)

643
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:47,834
As many as you want.
Trees everywhere.

644
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,674
We'll have space
all around us at last.

645
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,634
I still don't understand why
we couldn't find a place near Sydney.

646
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:58,474
I told you a hundred times -
Melbourne is the racing capital.

647
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,954
The big owners are here,
the big races. The big crowds.

648
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,554
Now, if you're going
to make your mark,

649
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,274
this is the place you have to be.

650
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,634
I'll just miss my friends.
Well, we'll make new ones.

651
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:11,634
Good God, woman, when this place
is set up it will be like paradise.

652
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:14,954
You'll have to beat the
visitors off with a stick.

653
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:17,707
Look, we're going to have
a racetrack over here.

654
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:20,546
Really make something
of that wreck of a house.

655
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:24,914
Can we have a bit of a garden?
Yeah - roses and everything.

656
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,714
Swings and slides for Cappy.

657
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:28,194
Is hard to imagine.

658
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:30,549
As long as we're not
getting in too deep.

659
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:34,834
I've worked on a
shoestring long enough

660
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:37,871
to know the only way to make
it in this game is do it big.

661
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:41,194
Now, you buy your yearlings,
you train 'em hard,

662
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:44,394
and if they don't shape up you get
rid of 'em and bring in some more.

663
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:45,827
Sol's no fool.

664
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:49,304
He wouldn't be lending me money
if there was any risk.

665
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,910
Every champion for the next 20 years
is going to come out of this place.

666
00:42:58,794 --> 00:43:00,994
Are you going to go down
to Melbourne with Telford?

667
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:03,234
I suppose.

668
00:43:03,234 --> 00:43:04,834
He's treated you pretty rotten.

669
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:07,394
Yeah, he's a cranky old ratbag.

670
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:09,544
But if I don't go down,
what will happen to Bobby?

671
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,474
Will you write?

672
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:13,907
Spelling's pretty crook.

673
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:17,467
Well, you'd better not, then.

674
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:22,467
I can't stand bad spelling.

675
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:50,274
Keep him moving, Tommy.
MAN: Stand back.

676
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,874
Harry... how did the
wonder horse travel?

677
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:55,874
Oh, I love the way you blokes keep
calling him the "wonder horse".

678
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,354
You weren't calling him that

679
00:43:57,354 --> 00:43:59,394
when he was losing all
his races at the start.

680
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:00,874
Well, he's really found form now.

681
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,674
Who do you think
made him find the form?

682
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,314
Do you reckon he learned
all by himself?

683
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,114
And you think he'll
win the Melbourne Cup?

684
00:44:06,114 --> 00:44:08,274
Of course he will.
And the Caulfield Cup.

685
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:11,234
You've entered him in both?
Why not? He'll win them.

686
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:15,514
A lot of owners would think
it was too strenuous for him.

687
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:18,314
A lot of owners don't
know anything about horses.

688
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:20,314
We've heard a lot about this
new training establishment

689
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:22,434
you're starting at Braeside -
is it ready yet?

690
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:25,274
Near enough.
MAN: Make way. Stand back.

691
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:26,707
Stand back, please.

692
00:44:53,874 --> 00:44:55,466
Looks good, eh?
Wonderful.

693
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,794
Harry, the bank's
just been on the phone.

694
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:02,674
They said we're overdrawn - badly.

695
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:05,586
Well, they're mad. I checked
the figures last night.

696
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:08,227
Here.

697
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:11,874
No wonder the country's in a mess.

698
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:14,394
Bloody banks can't
even do their sums.

699
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:18,074
(Laughs) Harry, you've counted
the six in the thousands column

700
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:20,754
instead of the hundreds.

701
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:23,871
Oh, God, so I have.
Let me do the books.

702
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,074
What are we going to tell the bank?

703
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:30,754
They'll just have to wait
till Phar Lap wins both the cups.

704
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:33,905
What do we do till then?
Tell 'em the cheque's in the mail.

705
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:40,914
DAVIS: Amounis and Phar Lap

706
00:45:40,914 --> 00:45:42,914
are the two best horses
in the country, right?

707
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:48,594
Now, if they both race in the
Caulfield Cup - no offence, May -

708
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:52,954
but Phar Lap's gonna come
in first and Amounis second.

709
00:45:52,954 --> 00:45:56,274
And if they both race
in the Melbourne Cup,

710
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:58,594
the same thing's gonna happen, OK?

711
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:03,874
Now, Bea, if you were a bookmaker
and I wanted to lay a bet with you

712
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:07,594
that Phar Lap would win both cups,
what kind of odds would you give me?

713
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:10,154
Very short odds.
Right.

714
00:46:10,154 --> 00:46:15,834
Now, if I wanted to lay a bet that
Amounis would win the Caulfield

715
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:19,554
and Phar Lap the Melbourne, then what
kind of odds would you give me?

716
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:22,314
Much better odds.
Amounis won't beat Phar Lap.

717
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:24,154
Exactly.

718
00:46:24,154 --> 00:46:26,554
So we put the money on the
Amounis-Phar Lap double,

719
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,034
now at what, Eric?

720
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,394
20, 30 to 1.

721
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:35,154
And at the last minute... we
scratch Phar Lap from the Caulfield

722
00:46:35,154 --> 00:46:37,274
and make a fortune.

723
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:39,354
Can you do things like that?

724
00:46:39,354 --> 00:46:42,744
Well... Can you get
the money on, Eric?

725
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,234
I'll have bets all round the country
before they know whas hit 'em.

726
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:48,714
Of course, we only have one problem -

727
00:46:48,714 --> 00:46:51,194
convincing Harry to pull
Phar Lap out of the Caulfield.

728
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:53,071
Give him a share of the winnings.

729
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:56,469
An honest man is someone who
hasn't had a good enough offer.

730
00:46:57,914 --> 00:46:59,394
You don't know Harry.

731
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:04,548
Alright, look, I'll go through
the figures with you once again.

732
00:47:07,714 --> 00:47:11,514
Whether you win both cups or not,

733
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:14,794
you're still gonna be bankrupt
within the next six months.

734
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:16,674
Here.

735
00:47:16,674 --> 00:47:19,154
Some of those yearlings
are going to be champions.

736
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:21,145
Well, you won't know that
for at least a year.

737
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:25,554
Harry, I am offering you L20,000 cash

738
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,874
to scratch Phar Lap
from the Caulfield Cup.

739
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:29,466
No.
"No."

740
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:33,674
You're crazy.
You're absolutely crazy.

741
00:47:33,674 --> 00:47:35,354
What the hell is the difference?

742
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:37,154
He'll still win the Melbourne Cup.

743
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,314
THAT'S the important one.
He's going to win them both.

744
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,747
Why? Why?

745
00:47:42,474 --> 00:47:45,994
Because is what every trainer
worth his salt dreams.

746
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:47,634
Dreams.

747
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:49,067
Dream... Vi!

748
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,274
You're good with figures.

749
00:47:52,274 --> 00:47:54,549
Will you please explain
to the man that I'm right?

750
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,508
Will you tell him that he's
gonna be broke within six months?

751
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:03,385
Harry's been in this game for 20
years and he's never been dishonest.

752
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,145
We can sell the yearlings
and put off staff.

753
00:48:09,274 --> 00:48:11,834
Harry, scratch the horse
and take the L20,000.

754
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:26,114
HARRY: I can't sell the yearlings.

755
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:29,194
One of them will turn out to
be a champion, nothing surer.

756
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:31,583
We could start again
in a year, Harry.

757
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:34,866
Anyway, we don't have
to sell all of them.

758
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,432
Maybe he has been raced too much.

759
00:48:39,994 --> 00:48:41,427
Perhaps he does need a rest.

760
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:19,350
(DOORBELL RINGS)

761
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,474
Can't you blokes ever
leave a man alone?

762
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:34,314
I've been trying to telephone you,
Harry, but you're always engaged.

763
00:49:34,314 --> 00:49:37,674
I leave the phone off the hook and
you still try to drive me barmy.

764
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,714
Why did you scratch Phar Lap
from the Caulfield Cup, Harry?

765
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:43,674
He's run-down, needs a rest.

766
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:46,074
You told me a few days ago
he was at his peak.

767
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:47,914
Why don't you just clear off?

768
00:49:47,914 --> 00:49:52,554
Harry... someone's put L50,000
on Amounis to win the Caulfield

769
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,034
and Phar Lap to win the Melbourne.

770
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,594
And they've got odds of 30 to 1.

771
00:49:57,754 --> 00:50:01,594
Nothing to do with me.
I'd be a bit worried if I were you.

772
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:02,594
Why?

773
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,027
Mrs Telford.

774
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:08,674
If Amounis wins the Caulfield...

775
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,834
...the only way some
bookies can save their necks

776
00:50:10,834 --> 00:50:13,632
is to stop Phar Lap
winning the Melbourne Cup.

777
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:18,634
No-one would hurt a
champion like Phar Lap.

778
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:20,234
You'd be surprised
what people will do

779
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:22,794
if they stand to lose

RACE CALLER: They're rounding the
home turn and Muratti is the leader

783
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:40,434
from Lampra, Shadow King,
Second Wind is joining in.

784
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:43,674
As they straighten up, and Amounis
is coming with a big turn of speed.

785
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,194
Coming to the furlong pole,
Muratti still in front.

786
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:48,874
Amounis is starting to peg
him back under his big weight.

787
00:50:48,874 --> 00:50:52,074
Amounis has ranged up on the outside
with a half-furlong to go.

788
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,194
Soulton coming home well, with Alcman
and Cragford, Second Wind.

789
00:50:55,194 --> 00:50:58,234
But Amounis is going on to score
a great win in the Caulfield Cup.

790
00:50:58,234 --> 00:51:01,834
And Amounis has won by a half-length
to Soulton, third Alcman.

Vi's even too scared
to leave the house.

I started getting these letters

as soon as Amounis
won the Caulfield Cup.

sort of thing in the mail?

I'm gonna call the police.
No!

Harry, if you call the police

they're only gonna ask why the

What happened? Did you just stand
there and let him get shot at?

Fair go, Harry. The lad put himself
between the horse and the gun.

In my opinion, he
deserves a bloody medal.

gotta get this horse somewhere safe.

Fast, before they try again.

somewhere safe too.

they might try to shoot you.

Don't worry. I'll take care of him,

their horses and their dogs.

01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:13,514
And Carradale is up there.

935
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:15,954
As they come onto the course
proper the first time,

936
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,114
where the leader here is Temptation,
showing out from Carradale.

937
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:22,394
They're going forward on the outside,
followed by Second Wind.

938
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:24,274
And a bit further back
is Shadow King,

939
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:26,234
and Phar Lap is well
back in the field.

940
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:27,714
As they come down the straight...

941
01:05:27,714 --> 01:05:30,634
Ha! The wonder horse seems
to have run out of steam.

942
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:33,234
You can't buy real quality
for 160 guineas.

943
01:05:33,234 --> 01:05:35,154
No.
Carradale's going well, Lachlan.

944
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:36,634
He's going to win me that cup.

945
01:05:36,634 --> 01:05:38,914
RACE CALLER: And Phar Lap is next,
on the outside of Muratti.

946
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:41,714
And a fair way back is Shadow King,
on the side of the track.

947
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:44,394
Is Temptation showing
out by 1.5 lengths.

948
01:05:44,394 --> 01:05:47,545
Now! Off you go, Bobby boy.

949
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:50,554
Thas it.

950
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:52,034
RACE CALLER: Some Quality,
and Phar Lap,

951
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:56,074
eased off the fence by Jim Pike,
is starting to go forward rapidly.

952
01:05:56,074 --> 01:05:58,354
As they come around
the back of the course,

953
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,274
is still Temptation out in the lead,
from Carradale,

954
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:01,874
running a good race, second.

955
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,104
Second Wind on the
inside of Shadow King.

956
01:06:09,554 --> 01:06:11,510
(Crowd roars)

957
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:17,828
RACE CALLER: And here comes
Phar Lap down the outside.

958
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:40,029
You've won it!

959
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,834
Now, don't get carried away.

960
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,594
A little bit of modesty
wouldn't go astray.

961
01:07:29,594 --> 01:07:31,554
Does he really know
why they're cheering?

962
01:07:31,554 --> 01:07:32,554
Know?

963
01:07:32,554 --> 01:07:35,114
Is the only reason he wins -
vain as a peacock. Aren't ya?

964
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,794
Thank you. Thank you very much.

965
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:22,307
Thank you for being here also.

966
01:08:23,354 --> 01:08:25,994
Guys, could you play something local

967
01:08:25,994 --> 01:08:30,954
for my very dear and very close
friend, Mr Harry Telford.

968
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:32,434
Thank you.

969
01:08:32,434 --> 01:08:35,392
(Band plays 'Along the Road
to Gundagai')

970
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:53,514
Of course, the real danger
when you're riding Phar Lap

971
01:08:53,514 --> 01:08:57,154
is he's so bloody smooth and easy,
you're liable to drop off...

972
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:58,587
...to sleep!

973
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:03,074
Congratulations, Mr Davis.

974
01:09:03,074 --> 01:09:05,554
Thank you, boys. Here you are, kid.

975
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:07,794
Thanks very much, Mr Davis.

976
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:11,714
A tenner? A tenner for the best
little strapper in Australia?

977
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,434
You lousy bastard.

978
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:14,914
He's drunk.

979
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:16,714
The horse only wins
'cause Tom tells him to.

980
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,306
CROWD: Yeah, you tell him.

981
01:09:20,554 --> 01:09:22,034
Here you go, Tommy.

982
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:25,231
Here, buy yourself a lemonade.

983
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,794
CROWD: Oh!

984
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:30,354
Jimmy, you can't give me that much.

985
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:32,234
I just have. I just have.

986
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:33,714
DAVIS: Excuse me.

987
01:09:33,714 --> 01:09:36,594
Hey, Davis. Don't be stingy,
let the moths out of your purse.

988
01:09:36,594 --> 01:09:38,949
CROWD: Yeah, come on.

989
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:43,583
Throws money around
like a bloke with no arms.

990
01:09:45,594 --> 01:09:47,107
Take it all, kid.

991
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:51,667
Thanks.

992
01:09:52,714 --> 01:09:55,794
Anyway, so there
I am having a little snooze.

993
01:09:55,794 --> 01:09:58,714
Suddenly I wake up and
we're halfway down the straight

994
01:09:58,714 --> 01:10:00,194
and all these horses out in front.

995
01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:02,947
And I thought, "Crikey,
I might have to use the whip!"

996
01:10:07,754 --> 01:10:09,790
Mrs Davis.
Oh, please, sit down.

997
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:12,994
How does it feel to be a wealthy man?

998
01:10:12,994 --> 01:10:15,074
I reckon I should give some back.

999
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:17,434
Back? I came over
to give you some more.

1000
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:18,914
Oh, Mrs Davis, no...

1001
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,434
Dave won a fortune today.

1002
01:10:20,434 --> 01:10:21,914
Thanks.

1003
01:10:21,914 --> 01:10:23,474
What are you gonna do with it?

1004
01:10:23,474 --> 01:10:25,226
Gawd, I don't know.

1005
01:10:26,394 --> 01:10:28,714
Isn't there a girl
in Sydney you're fond of?

1006
01:10:28,714 --> 01:10:30,194
Emma?

1007
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:32,230
I've only taken her out once or twice.

1008
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:34,754
Do you write to her?

1009
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:36,314
I've sent her a postcard or two.

1010
01:10:36,314 --> 01:10:38,034
Is she pretty?

1011
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:41,834
Too right! I reckon if she was
in America, she could be in films!

1012
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:43,354
Oh, as pretty as that.

1013
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:45,034
Yeah. You ask Cashy.

1014
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:48,154
And all those stars have got
make-up and everything to help 'em.

1015
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:50,434
She looks just as good
as they do without it.

1016
01:10:50,434 --> 01:10:51,947
Have you told her that?

1017
01:10:53,954 --> 01:10:55,434
Wouldn't be game.

1018
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:56,914
Why not?

1019
01:10:56,914 --> 01:10:59,348
You'd make a real dill of yourself.

1020
01:11:01,154 --> 01:11:03,074
Sometimes I wonder
how Australian men

1021
01:11:03,074 --> 01:11:04,994
ever manage to find themselves wives.

1022
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,792
Go up to Sydney and see her, Tommy.

1023
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,794
I want you to know
that whatever differences

1024
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:19,474
you and I have had
personally through the years,

1025
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:22,434
I have never, ever doubted
your ability as a trainer.

1026
01:11:22,434 --> 01:11:25,154
And when your lease
on Phar Lap is up,

1027
01:11:25,154 --> 01:11:27,588
I still want you
to stay on and train him.

1028
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:31,271
You're not gonna offer me a share?

1029
01:11:32,314 --> 01:11:35,874
Sure. You'll get your training
fees plus 10% of his winnings.

1030
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,674
But I found that horse.
I made him a champion.

1031
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:42,554
And you've also had him for 3 years
and won yourself a Melbourne Cup.

1032
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:47,105
You give me 50% of him
or find some other trainer.

1033
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:50,434
Don't threaten me, Telford.

1034
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:53,710
There are plenty of other
good trainers around.

1035
01:11:55,914 --> 01:11:59,270
Well, you find one who'll make
him win as often as I do.

1036
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:05,594
Stubborn bastard.

1037
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:07,312
Who?
Harry.

1038
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:10,868
He wants a half-share on the horse.
Can you believe it?

1039
01:12:12,114 --> 01:12:13,547
As if it was his right!

1040
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:16,874
He's done very well
with the horse, Dave.

1041
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,314
So? You think he's entitled
to a half-share?

1042
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:22,545
Well, people will think you're being
pretty unfair if you don't offer.

1043
01:12:23,754 --> 01:12:25,551
What the hell do I care
what people think?

1044
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,834
Where were all these people
when I was 11 years old

1045
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,314
and walked halfway across Europe?

1046
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:32,032
Nobody lifted a goddamn
finger to help me.

1047
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:34,747
Huh?

1048
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:38,114
Would it be wise to change trainers?

1049
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:40,184
Harry's had a lot of success.

1050
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:43,394
Alright, I'll offer him half share,

1051
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:45,194
but he's gonna pay me
good money for it,

1052
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,627
whether he likes it or not.

1053
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:55,914
Boss?

1054
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,347
Yeah?

1055
01:13:00,234 --> 01:13:02,987
That ointment you're using,
is making his heel worse.

1056
01:13:04,754 --> 01:13:06,187
I know what I'm doing.

1057
01:13:16,154 --> 01:13:17,906
Is he getting any better?

1058
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:22,307
Worse.

1059
01:13:23,354 --> 01:13:25,549
Well, what does this mean
in terms of the horse's future?

1060
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:28,314
Mightn't have a future.

1061
01:13:28,314 --> 01:13:29,994
Wait a minute. Harry.

1062
01:13:29,994 --> 01:13:33,154
A cracked heel can't stop
a horse from racing.

1063
01:13:33,154 --> 01:13:34,634
Can it?

1064
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:36,114
I'm afraid so, Dave.

1065
01:13:36,114 --> 01:13:37,786
Happens all the time.

1066
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:42,430
A man would be a fool to pay L20,000
for a share in the big fella now.

1067
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:52,151
Don't you think L20,000 is a bit
too much to ask Harry to pay?

1068
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:54,674
He didn't pay L20,000,
he paid L 4,000.

1069
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:55,954
What?

1070
01:13:55,954 --> 01:13:58,194
To tell you the truth,
I was lucky to get that.

1071
01:13:58,194 --> 01:13:59,674
The horse is lame.

1072
01:13:59,674 --> 01:14:02,234
Could be washed up, finished.

1073
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:03,713
Oh, Dave.

1074
01:14:04,794 --> 01:14:07,752
(Crowd chants) Phar Lap, Phar Lap!

1075
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,587
No future, huh?

1076
01:14:15,194 --> 01:14:16,674
Nothing can stop him.

1077
01:14:16,674 --> 01:14:18,514
Weight could stop him.

1078
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:20,630
Weight could stop a train.

1079
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:52,594
No Phar Lap! Phar Lap punts are off!

1080
01:14:52,594 --> 01:14:55,194
RACE CALLER: And now we see this
ridiculous sight of the two horses.

1081
01:14:55,194 --> 01:14:57,994
Phar Lap and Chide.
Phar Lap is just so much better.

1082
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,434
Chide is flat out,
now let Phar Lap go

1083
01:15:00,434 --> 01:15:02,194
and is little more
than an exercise gallop.

1084
01:15:02,194 --> 01:15:03,627
And Phar Lap wins...

1085
01:15:06,434 --> 01:15:08,314
No more. You can close the bag.

1086
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:10,594
No more bets, punters.
I've had enough of Phar Lap.

1087
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,034
He's getting as much weight
as any other horse has ever got.

1088
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:14,554
He's not any other horse.

1089
01:15:14,554 --> 01:15:17,910
He's a freak, and should
be weighted accordingly.

1090
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,154
RACE CALLER: The weighs making
no difference to Phar Lap.

1091
01:15:35,154 --> 01:15:36,754
He's drawn away for a great win.

1092
01:15:36,754 --> 01:15:39,029
He can't carry more weight, Lachlan.

1093
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:41,634
There'd be a huge outcry.

1094
01:15:41,634 --> 01:15:43,989
We're here to further
the interests of racing.

1095
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:50,274
RACE CALLER: And the mighty
champion has forged to the lead,

1096
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:51,754
and despite his crushing weight,

1097
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:53,506
Phar Lap is racing
on to a gallant win.

1098
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:03,434
That run bloody nearly
killed him today!

1099
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,634
He's alright.
He's not alright, Harry.

1100
01:16:05,634 --> 01:16:07,314
I give you fair warning -

1101
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,314
I've never had a horse
drop dead under me yet,

1102
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,514
and I don't want the first
one to be Phar Lap.

1103
01:16:11,514 --> 01:16:12,994
Dave?

1104
01:16:12,994 --> 01:16:14,427
Yeah?

1105
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:19,474
Dave, I'd like you
to meet Jim Crofton.

1106
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,954
Jim.
Dave.

1107
01:16:20,954 --> 01:16:23,074
Quite a horse you got there.
Yeah, thanks.

1108
01:16:23,074 --> 01:16:25,274
He barely won by a whisker today.

1109
01:16:25,274 --> 01:16:28,474
Is a wonder he could run at all
with all the weight they put on him.

1110
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:30,634
If you want my candid opinion,
I think is criminal.

1111
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:33,114
Jim runs the Agua Caliente
Racecourse in Mexico.

1112
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:34,594
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1113
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:36,274
I'll level with you, Dave.

1114
01:16:36,274 --> 01:16:38,074
We're organising a really
big race down there.

1115
01:16:38,074 --> 01:16:39,554
We want your horse.

1116
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,863
We'll pay all your expenses,
of course.

1117
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:44,554
$100,000 stake.

1118
01:16:44,554 --> 01:16:46,704
Richest race in history.

1119
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:52,314
He seemed to be struggling
to win today.

1120
01:16:52,314 --> 01:16:55,674
Apart from all the weight, he's got
a crook heel and a bad cold.

1121
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:57,674
Oh, Tommy.

1122
01:16:57,674 --> 01:17:00,194
(Tuts) His pulse is still racing.

1123
01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:03,274
Well, why did Mr Telford enter
him if he's got a cold?

1124
01:17:03,274 --> 01:17:06,034
Oh, he enters him for everything
and trains him to death as well!

1125
01:17:06,034 --> 01:17:07,554
Why?

1126
01:17:07,554 --> 01:17:09,351
He needs the money
to keep Braeside going.

1127
01:17:10,554 --> 01:17:12,074
He's pretty obsessed
with Braeside, isn't he?

1128
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:13,554
Oh, he's mad!

1129
01:17:13,554 --> 01:17:15,154
He bought another
10 yearlings last week,

1130
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:16,906
and none of them look
any good to me.

1131
01:17:17,954 --> 01:17:21,071
Don't worry about it.
I'll talk to Dave.

1132
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:29,354
I shouldn't have said
anything, Mrs Davis.

1133
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,185
I can understand how you feel.

1134
01:17:33,794 --> 01:17:36,991
You'll be right, Red. You'll be right.

1135
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,074
Did you ever go and see Emma?

1136
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:44,434
No. Heard she was going
around with another bloke.

1137
01:17:44,434 --> 01:17:46,994
Oh, Tommy, you can't
give in like that.

1138
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:50,354
Go and see her - and make
your intentions clear.

1139
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:52,822
Go on. Propose.

1140
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,707
Yeah. Reckon I might.

1141
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,514
G'day, Emma.

1142
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:28,426
Tommy! What are you doing up here?

1143
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:33,111
I got a present for you.

1144
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,474
I want you to marry me.

1145
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:42,514
I don't know what to say.

1146
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:44,869
Don't say anything. Put it on
your finger before you lose it.

1147
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:48,190
I thought you were never
gonna get round to it.

1148
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:59,144
(CHURCH BELLS RING)

1149
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:09,667
Nice big smile.

1150
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:16,510
OK, mums and dads now, please.

1151
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:25,554
Cashy, lan, what are you
two doing up here?

1152
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:27,154
Uh, the boss sent us up here, Tommy.

1153
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:28,794
The big fella's fretting
and won't eat.

1154
01:19:28,794 --> 01:19:31,314
He says you gotta come
back straightaway. Now.

1155
01:19:31,314 --> 01:19:34,194
But... what about Emma?
What about the honeymoon?

1156
01:19:34,194 --> 01:19:35,994
There's no time, mate.
Bobby's real bad.

1157
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:37,834
Come on, we've got a car
across the street.

1158
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:39,267
Wait a minute.

1159
01:19:40,394 --> 01:19:41,827
I've gotta tell her.

1160
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,234
You pair of bastards!

1161
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:49,667
Congratulations, mate. Good on ya.

1162
01:20:07,954 --> 01:20:09,914
Well, thas the end of Phar Lap.

1163
01:20:09,914 --> 01:20:11,914
They've given him 10 stone 10
for the Melbourne Cup.

1164
01:20:11,914 --> 01:20:13,514
What are they trying to do,
kill him?

1165
01:20:13,514 --> 01:20:15,034
If they have to.

1166
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:17,434
Has any horse ever carried that
much weight in a 2-mile race?

1167
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:18,914
Nowhere near it.

1168
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,154
I'm a tolerant man,
Jack, as you know,

1169
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,194
but finally I'm forced
to the conclusion

1170
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,867
that McKinnon and his cronies
are a pack of pricks.

1171
01:20:31,514 --> 01:20:33,434
Maybe Mr Davis won't let him run.

1172
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:34,914
Yes, he will.

1173
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:38,194
He wants the gold cup -
Telford got it last year -

1174
01:20:38,194 --> 01:20:40,424
and he won't pull him out
because he needs the money.

1175
01:20:41,994 --> 01:20:44,474
Even the papers are saying
if he runs, it could finish him.

1176
01:20:44,474 --> 01:20:45,954
They're right.

1177
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:47,434
Ill kill him.

1178
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:49,231
Everyone says so.

1179
01:20:57,674 --> 01:21:00,634
Telforÿs getting a stack of mail
begging him to pull Bobby out.

1180
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:03,034
You can bet your life
he won't take a bit of notice.

1181
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:04,514
Keep on at him.

1182
01:21:04,514 --> 01:21:06,391
He just won't listen.

1183
01:21:07,714 --> 01:21:09,545
Then make him listen, Tommy.

1184
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:17,114
Don't start again.
He's running and thas final.

1185
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:18,594
You'll kill him!

1186
01:21:18,594 --> 01:21:20,074
I'll kill him? Bull!

1187
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:21,554
That bloody horse is killing me.

1188
01:21:21,554 --> 01:21:25,434
Letters, phone calls, press,
telegrams - cranks abuse me.

1189
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:27,186
Never had a minute's
peace since I got him.

1190
01:21:28,234 --> 01:21:30,034
Don't you care what happens to him?

1191
01:21:30,034 --> 01:21:31,514
Nothing's gonna happen to him.

1192
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:34,834
You're the one who's gonna have
to face your conscience if it does.

1193
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:37,994
Is not just up to me.
Davis wants that cup.

1194
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:39,666
He can forget about that.

1195
01:21:40,754 --> 01:21:42,904
Boss, you know there's
no way he'll win it.

1196
01:21:44,514 --> 01:21:46,354
Oh, you're probably right.

1197
01:21:46,354 --> 01:21:49,634
No horse could win over
two miles carrying that weight.

1198
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:52,865
So, if Mr Davis agrees to scratch
him, will you go along with it?

1199
01:21:55,474 --> 01:21:56,954
I suppose I'll have to.

1200
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,865
Is the only way
you'll give me any peace.

1201
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:05,074
He won't win it, Mr Davis.

1202
01:22:05,074 --> 01:22:07,714
I don't understand why
you're so worried.

1203
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,314
If there's too much weight on him,

1204
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:11,114
ill slow him down
and he won't win, OK,

1205
01:22:11,114 --> 01:22:12,634
but you're talking as though...

1206
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:15,834
He'll bust a gut trying,
Mr Davis. Really.

1207
01:22:15,834 --> 01:22:17,314
I know him.

1208
01:22:17,314 --> 01:22:19,954
Kid, come on, you wanna do
me a favour? Cut the violins.

1209
01:22:19,954 --> 01:22:23,074
Mr Davis, why do you think
he got up last week,

1210
01:22:23,074 --> 01:22:25,034
when he was crook, and still won?

1211
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,954
Why do you think Jim Pike's
never had to use the whip?

1212
01:22:27,954 --> 01:22:30,714
He was in a terrible state
after the race, Dave.

1213
01:22:30,714 --> 01:22:32,864
He'd still try and win
if his legs were cut off.

1214
01:22:35,314 --> 01:22:37,874
Mr Davis, I know how much
you want to win the cup...

1215
01:22:37,874 --> 01:22:41,634
Not just the cup. We have
an obligation to the public.

1216
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:43,314
He can still keep winning for years

1217
01:22:43,314 --> 01:22:45,994
in weight-for-age where they
can't handicap him out of it.

1218
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,634
You're putting his whole
future at risk.

1219
01:22:48,634 --> 01:22:51,314
Tommy knows the horse
better than anyone.

1220
01:22:51,314 --> 01:22:53,594
Alright, alright, alright.
Is alright with me.

1221
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,274
But you're still gonna have to get
Harry to agree, and that is...

1222
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:57,707
He already has.

1223
01:23:06,794 --> 01:23:08,434
Ah, Davis.

1224
01:23:08,434 --> 01:23:10,634
It was good of you to come
at such short notice.

1225
01:23:10,634 --> 01:23:12,314
I'll get straight to the point.

1226
01:23:12,314 --> 01:23:14,034
There's a strong rumour going around

1227
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:16,034
that your horse is to be
scratched from the cup.

1228
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,554
His name is Phar Lap.

1229
01:23:17,554 --> 01:23:19,034
Is it true?
Yes.

1230
01:23:19,034 --> 01:23:20,514
Would you mind telling me why?

1231
01:23:20,514 --> 01:23:23,634
Because you've given him
an impossible weight to carry.

1232
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:25,434
You mean the handicappers?

1233
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:26,914
No, I meant you.

1234
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:29,994
Are you implying, Mr Davis, that we
try and influence the handicappers?

1235
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:31,427
Yes.

1236
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,351
I won't even bother
to answer that charge.

1237
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:37,914
You realise, of course,
that under our rules,

1238
01:23:37,914 --> 01:23:40,554
you can't scratch a horse
without a good reason.

1239
01:23:40,554 --> 01:23:43,914
We have it on very good advice

1240
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:48,434
that Phar Lap could be permanently
incapacitated if he runs.

1241
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:52,394
Nonsense. We've been assured that
the horse is in no danger whatsoever.

1242
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,827
Wait a minute. Excuse me.

1243
01:23:56,274 --> 01:23:57,707
Let me understand this.

1244
01:23:58,794 --> 01:24:00,714
Are you ordering me to run him?

1245
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:03,234
I'm requesting you very strongly.
Oh, I see.

1246
01:24:03,234 --> 01:24:05,594
If we find he's been
scratched without good cause,

1247
01:24:05,594 --> 01:24:08,954
we can ban you and any horse
you're associated with

1248
01:24:08,954 --> 01:24:10,714
from ever racing in this State again.

1249
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:13,194
Do you mind repeating that?

1250
01:24:13,194 --> 01:24:15,794
The race-going public
are expecting your horse to run...

1251
01:24:15,794 --> 01:24:18,354
His name is Phar Lap.
Horse's name is Phar Lap.

1252
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:20,114
And I don't see why two owners

1253
01:24:20,114 --> 01:24:22,234
with a grudge against the
handicappers and the VRC

1254
01:24:22,234 --> 01:24:23,954
should deprive them of that.

1255
01:24:23,954 --> 01:24:25,434
I see.

1256
01:24:25,434 --> 01:24:28,154
You put a ton on his back
so that he can't possibly win,

1257
01:24:28,154 --> 01:24:31,114
but you want him there
to draw the crowds.

1258
01:24:31,114 --> 01:24:32,594
Very smart.

1259
01:24:32,594 --> 01:24:34,869
I'm acting in the best
interests of racing.

1260
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:44,870
Well... you've finally done it,
haven't you, now, McKinnon?

1261
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:51,474
If we scratch him,
he's barred from racing

1262
01:24:51,474 --> 01:24:54,274
and if we run him, there's a very
good chance of his breaking down,

1263
01:24:54,274 --> 01:24:56,868
and either way, you and your
cronies win it all, don't you?

1264
01:24:58,354 --> 01:25:01,514
I don't think there's any purpose
in prolonging this conversation.

1265
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:02,947
No, there really isn't.

1266
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:28,394
Take it easy today, alright?

1267
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:29,914
Don't go busting your boiler.

1268
01:25:29,914 --> 01:25:31,594
He'll be alright, Tom.

1269
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:33,394
If I see he's gone, I won't push him.

1270
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:35,154
Thanks, Pikey.

1271
01:25:35,154 --> 01:25:38,394
RACE CALLER:
And here's Phar Lap, number one,

1272
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:41,511
in line for his second Melbourne Cup
being led out onto the track.

1273
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:44,314
They're off!

1274
01:25:44,314 --> 01:25:46,514
And White Nose was one
of the first to jump out,

1275
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:47,994
with Phar Lap beginning well.

1276
01:25:47,994 --> 01:25:51,754
St Mary away quickly
and so also is Koomela.

1277
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:54,314
He's prominent, but just
in behind is Carry On.

1278
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:57,754
And then Concentrate, a bit further
back in the field, Madstar.

1279
01:25:57,754 --> 01:25:59,954
They're racing down
the straight for the first time,

1280
01:25:59,954 --> 01:26:02,674
and White Nose in charge,
leads by a length and a half.

1281
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:05,914
Moving up on the outside, Koomela
is second, then Second Wind,

1282
01:26:05,914 --> 01:26:09,394
and Phar Lap running over on the
inside as they pass the judge

1283
01:26:09,394 --> 01:26:11,430
and go towards the side
of the track...

1284
01:26:27,274 --> 01:26:29,154
Coming down past the '3' now,

1285
01:26:29,154 --> 01:26:31,794
and White Nose on the
inside is still in front.

1286
01:26:31,794 --> 01:26:33,354
He's been taken by Second Wind,

1287
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,034
and here comes the mighty Phar Lap.

1288
01:26:35,034 --> 01:26:38,514
Phar Lap is coming up quickly now,
behind White Nose,

1289
01:26:38,514 --> 01:26:40,994
Phar Lap is trying to bridge
the gap with White Nose.

1290
01:26:40,994 --> 01:26:43,914
Phar Lap on the outside,
coming up with White Nose.

1291
01:26:43,914 --> 01:26:45,954
Second Wind and Shadow King
on the left.

1292
01:26:45,954 --> 01:26:47,554
White Nose is holding Phar Lap.

1293
01:26:47,554 --> 01:26:49,954
This is incredible, he's struggling
under his big weight.

1294
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:52,834
Phar Lap is starting to weaken,
is White Nose and Second Wind...

1295
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:54,474
Give it up, boy. Is alright.

1296
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:56,074
...Phar Lap is dropping
out of the quick,

1297
01:26:56,074 --> 01:26:59,394
and White Nose is going for
the shot with Shadow King.

1298
01:26:59,394 --> 01:27:03,273
Phar Lap is dropping and White Nose
will come down to line before...

1299
01:27:10,914 --> 01:27:15,032
(All jeer and boo)

1300
01:28:02,954 --> 01:28:04,592
Crofton!

1301
01:28:06,194 --> 01:28:07,794
Excuse me.

1302
01:28:07,794 --> 01:28:10,154
Does your offer still stand?
Sure does.

1303
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:11,754
Look, there's not
a horse in the world

1304
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:13,554
could have won over that
distance carrying that weight.

1305
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,431
I'm amazed he even finished
without breaking down.

1306
01:28:17,114 --> 01:28:18,547
Les talk, alright?

1307
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:22,034
Too many risks.
What risks?

1308
01:28:22,034 --> 01:28:25,154
The voyage over,
going into their winter,

1309
01:28:25,154 --> 01:28:28,394
dirt tracks, different feeding,
different styles of racing.

1310
01:28:28,394 --> 01:28:29,874
Cashy!

1311
01:28:29,874 --> 01:28:31,394
If you take him over there,

1312
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:33,194
our quarantine laws
are gonna make it bloody hard

1313
01:28:33,194 --> 01:28:34,674
to bring him back home!

1314
01:28:34,674 --> 01:28:36,154
Alright, I grant you is a risk.

1315
01:28:36,154 --> 01:28:37,634
But if it pays off, Harry,

1316
01:28:37,634 --> 01:28:40,592
we're gonna have more money than we
ever thought we'd have in our lives.

1317
01:28:44,514 --> 01:28:46,903
Alright. Take him.

1318
01:28:48,074 --> 01:28:51,703
Great. We're gonna have to be ready
to go in about three weeks, OK?

1319
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:54,314
I'm not going.

1320
01:28:54,314 --> 01:28:56,191
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

1321
01:28:57,514 --> 01:28:58,994
What do you mean you're not going?

1322
01:28:58,994 --> 01:29:01,114
I got 40 horses to look after here.

1323
01:29:01,114 --> 01:29:03,114
Three of them are coming up
for their first race.

1324
01:29:03,114 --> 01:29:05,753
You have to go.
Who's gonna train the horse?

1325
01:29:06,794 --> 01:29:09,514
Tommy.
Woodcock?

1326
01:29:09,514 --> 01:29:11,114
What the hell does
he know about training?

1327
01:29:11,114 --> 01:29:13,234
He's a good strapper.
Best I've ever had.

1328
01:29:13,234 --> 01:29:14,714
This is not what I'm asking you,

1329
01:29:14,714 --> 01:29:16,314
I said, "What does he
know about training?"

1330
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:18,114
You're gonna have to take
him with you anyway,

1331
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:20,514
the bloody horse won't even fart
unless Tommy tells him is alright!

1332
01:29:20,514 --> 01:29:22,314
Harry, I can't go to
the States without you!

1333
01:29:22,314 --> 01:29:24,314
I'm not going!
I'm sick of the sight of him!

1334
01:29:24,314 --> 01:29:26,270
Bloody horse has given me
trouble since I got him.

1335
01:29:28,634 --> 01:29:30,314
You won't forget to write.

1336
01:29:30,314 --> 01:29:31,794
Of course not.

1337
01:29:31,794 --> 01:29:34,034
'Cause I wanna know what
the Americans talk like.

1338
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:35,994
What they eat, how they dress.

1339
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:37,474
What they think about Bobby.

1340
01:29:37,474 --> 01:29:39,354
Yeah.
You gotta write everything.

1341
01:29:39,354 --> 01:29:40,834
I'll try my best.

1342
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,950
Oh, I know you'll be busy.

1343
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:46,511
Gee, I'm gonna miss you, Tommy.

1344
01:29:49,994 --> 01:29:52,952
Hey, um, Bobby's on.
Train's ready to go.

1345
01:29:54,554 --> 01:29:55,987
Go on, I'm not looking.

1346
01:30:03,074 --> 01:30:06,464
All aboard! (Blows whistle)

1347
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:10,674
Here, come on, Tommy!
The bloody train's going.

1348
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:12,312
I love you.
Ta-ta.

1349
01:30:13,794 --> 01:30:15,227
Come on!

1350
01:30:54,874 --> 01:30:56,307
Suppose I'd better go, boss.

1351
01:30:58,994 --> 01:31:00,473
You're the boss now, Tom.

1352
01:31:10,234 --> 01:31:11,667
One more thing.

1353
01:31:13,114 --> 01:31:14,627
Don't be too soft on him.

1354
01:31:39,274 --> 01:31:43,114
(SHIP HORN BLARES)

1355
01:31:43,114 --> 01:31:44,547
MAN: Good luck, Tommy.

1356
01:32:39,794 --> 01:32:41,864
Uh-oh. Here's trouble.

1357
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:53,354
Well, Dave. What a surprise.

1358
01:32:53,354 --> 01:32:55,394
Alright, don't bullshit me, now,
Crofton. Whas going on?

1359
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:57,434
Dave, this is our chairman,
Baron Long.

1360
01:32:57,434 --> 01:32:59,834
You're looking good, Dave.
I'm looking terrible.

1361
01:32:59,834 --> 01:33:01,754
I asked you something -
whas going on?

1362
01:33:01,754 --> 01:33:03,314
Mr Davis, please don't
get alarmed...

1363
01:33:03,314 --> 01:33:06,594
The minute I stepped onto that wharf,
there was a reporter there asking me,

1364
01:33:06,594 --> 01:33:09,074
how do I feel about
Agua Caliente going broke?

1365
01:33:09,074 --> 01:33:12,354
It was a very nice welcome back
to my native land. Thank you.

1366
01:33:12,354 --> 01:33:13,834
Just calm down, Dave.

1367
01:33:13,834 --> 01:33:15,834
Look, we got a little
bit of a cash problem

1368
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:17,314
due to the current
economic situation,

1369
01:33:17,314 --> 01:33:18,994
but once our publicity
machine gets rolling,

1370
01:33:18,994 --> 01:33:21,554
that horse of yours is gonna
pull us right out of the red.

1371
01:33:24,594 --> 01:33:27,634
If I had known you wanted
Phar Lap as publicity bait,

1372
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:29,714
I never would have
put him on that boat.

1373
01:33:29,714 --> 01:33:31,874
Do you know the risks
I've taken getting him here?

1374
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:35,274
Mr Davis, don't panic.
The race will be run.

1375
01:33:35,274 --> 01:33:38,794
You'll get your $100,000,
plus your expenses, plus your bets

1376
01:33:38,794 --> 01:33:40,274
and everyone will end up happy.

1377
01:33:40,274 --> 01:33:42,034
Sure, by the time the race is run,

1378
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:44,548
everybody is America is going to
be talking about your horse, Dave.

1379
01:34:17,434 --> 01:34:19,634
JIM: Welcome, gentlemen. Welcome.

1380
01:34:19,634 --> 01:34:21,114
May I introduce you to

1381
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:24,902
the lucky owner of the worlÿs
greatest galloper, Mr Dave Davis.

1382
01:34:25,954 --> 01:34:27,434
Thank you again.

1383
01:34:27,434 --> 01:34:30,954
I'd like to start things off by
introducing Phar Lap's trainer,

1384
01:34:30,954 --> 01:34:32,387
Mr Woodcock...

1385
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:35,274
...his strapper, Mr Martin,

1386
01:34:35,274 --> 01:34:37,194
his vet, Mr Nielsen,

1387
01:34:37,194 --> 01:34:39,424
his jockey, Mr Elliot...

1388
01:34:40,914 --> 01:34:43,154
...and this beautiful young lady
here is my wife, Bea.

1389
01:34:43,154 --> 01:34:45,145
Now, gentlemen,
any questions, please.

1390
01:34:46,394 --> 01:34:48,594
Is he really the worlÿs
greatest galloper, Mr Davis?

1391
01:34:48,594 --> 01:34:53,474
Well, without taking anything away
from your great American champions,

1392
01:34:53,474 --> 01:34:54,954
yes, I truly believe so.

1393
01:34:54,954 --> 01:34:56,834
Have you seen the field
he's up against?

1394
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:57,914
Yes.

1395
01:34:57,914 --> 01:35:01,674
Spanish Play, Joe Flores,
Cabezo, Reveille Boy.

1396
01:35:01,674 --> 01:35:03,994
Well, fine horses all of them,

1397
01:35:03,994 --> 01:35:05,674
but believe me when
I tell you, gentlemen,

1398
01:35:05,674 --> 01:35:07,234
they are no threat to Phar Lap.

1399
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:10,154
JIM: Gentlemen, I have seen the
Red Terror race with my own eyes,

1400
01:35:10,154 --> 01:35:12,554
and I can sum it up
in one word - unbelievable.

1401
01:35:12,554 --> 01:35:14,834
Won't he have trouble acclimatising?

1402
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:19,034
I don't think so. We've brought
everything to make him feel at home.

1403
01:35:19,034 --> 01:35:21,794
We've even brought his food
all the way from Australia.

1404
01:35:21,794 --> 01:35:23,354
Can we get a few pictures?

1405
01:35:23,354 --> 01:35:24,954
Certainly, gentlemen,
no problem at all.

1406
01:35:24,954 --> 01:35:27,154
Tommy, you wanna bring the horse
over here for the gentlemen...

1407
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,354
Thall do. Is hot out here,
no good for the horse.

1408
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:31,554
Tom, you wanna bring
the horse over here, please?

1409
01:35:31,554 --> 01:35:33,674
Uh, don't forget to show his
hindquarters, gentlemen.

1410
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:35,154
Please, is very important.

1411
01:35:35,154 --> 01:35:36,634
Tom, where the hell are you going?

1412
01:35:36,634 --> 01:35:38,634
He came here to race,
not to do this bullshit.

1413
01:35:38,634 --> 01:35:42,074
The most powerful hindquarters in the
world, gentlemen. Get a good shot.

1414
01:35:42,074 --> 01:35:44,474
Tom, come back here, goddammit.
This is the National Press.

1415
01:35:44,474 --> 01:35:46,074
He should have been fed an hour ago.

1416
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,474
JIM: Uh, please, gentlemen. Plenty
of food and drink at the pavilion.

1417
01:35:48,474 --> 01:35:50,234
Did you hear that?

1418
01:35:50,234 --> 01:35:52,464
Looks like you've got
yourself a good trainer.

1419
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:57,114
What is this Woodcock guy? The press
can't get near that animal of yours.

1420
01:35:57,114 --> 01:35:59,594
He's guarding him as if
he could eat straw and pass gold!

1421
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:01,714
We really need the publicity, Dave.
I know.

1422
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,194
He even sleeps with the horse.

1423
01:36:03,194 --> 01:36:04,674
What - is he some kind of pervert?

1424
01:36:04,674 --> 01:36:07,074
Well, can't you just... fire the guy?

1425
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:08,714
If I did, the goddamned horse

1426
01:36:08,714 --> 01:36:11,069
would sit in his stall
for the next month and cry.

1427
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:33,154
When's he gonna gallop?
In a week or two.

1428
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:34,634
A week or two?

1429
01:36:34,634 --> 01:36:36,554
I'm bringing him up to peak slowly.

1430
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:38,954
Harry would have been working
his butt off by now, you know?

1431
01:36:38,954 --> 01:36:40,594
I'm not Harry.

1432
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,874
You're getting too smart for
your own good, you know that, kid?

1433
01:36:43,874 --> 01:36:45,474
I want that horse fit.

1434
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:46,907
He will be.

1435
01:36:47,954 --> 01:36:50,554
Have you changed his shoes yet,
like the track vet advised you to?

1436
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,754
He's been wearing the kind
he's got on all his life.

1437
01:36:52,754 --> 01:36:54,506
The track vet doesn't know
what he's talking about.

1438
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:57,830
The track vet doesn't know
what he's talking about, huh?

1439
01:36:59,834 --> 01:37:02,434
You were told about the harder
surfaces over here, weren't you?

1440
01:37:02,434 --> 01:37:04,186
You were told he could
pick up a stone.

1441
01:37:05,234 --> 01:37:06,754
Well?

1442
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:08,354
He'll have to be scratched.

1443
01:37:08,354 --> 01:37:09,834
No, he's gotta run.

1444
01:37:09,834 --> 01:37:11,314
I got him backed for a fortune.

1445
01:37:11,314 --> 01:37:13,714
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Half his hoof is hanging off.

1446
01:37:13,714 --> 01:37:16,994
Cut it away, Bill. Ill heal.

1447
01:37:16,994 --> 01:37:19,154
Before the race?
Lll heal.

1448
01:37:19,154 --> 01:37:20,587
Hold it!

1449
01:37:21,914 --> 01:37:23,347
Is there any chance?

1450
01:37:24,794 --> 01:37:26,274
Is possible.

1451
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:27,787
Then do it.

1452
01:37:29,514 --> 01:37:31,114
Now, how are you gonna get him fit?

1453
01:37:31,114 --> 01:37:34,072
Walk him. I'll keep him moving all day.

1454
01:37:37,554 --> 01:37:39,114
You know something?

1455
01:37:39,114 --> 01:37:42,474
Harry must have been out of his mind
when he recommended you as a trainer.

1456
01:37:42,474 --> 01:37:45,114
And I must have been out
of my mind to listen to him.

1457
01:37:45,114 --> 01:37:46,594
Mr Davis.
What?

1458
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:49,434
Harry Telford used to train
that horse too hard.

1459
01:37:49,434 --> 01:37:54,110
If I can get him 90% fit,
his hearll get him to the line.

1460
01:37:55,554 --> 01:37:57,954
The amount of faith you put
in that heart of his, kid,

1461
01:37:57,954 --> 01:37:59,512
it must be one hell of an organ.

1462
01:38:35,234 --> 01:38:38,314
MAN: There are rumours that the
horse is carrying a serious injury.

1463
01:38:38,314 --> 01:38:40,954
The horse is fit, totally fit.

1464
01:38:40,954 --> 01:38:42,754
Then why hasn't he been
out on the track?

1465
01:38:42,754 --> 01:38:44,954
What about all these rumours
that his hoof is cracked?

1466
01:38:44,954 --> 01:38:47,634
Gentlemen, Phar Lap has stepped
on a stone and bruised his foot.

1467
01:38:47,634 --> 01:38:49,434
MEN: How badly?
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1468
01:38:49,434 --> 01:38:51,834
We put a mud pack on it
and we do not expect that

1469
01:38:51,834 --> 01:38:54,194
it will significantly interfere
with the horse's preparation.

1470
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:56,674
Then when are we likely to see...
Thank you, gentlemen, thas it.

1471
01:38:56,674 --> 01:38:58,710
Well, is healing.

1472
01:38:59,914 --> 01:39:02,314
Faster than I expected
but not fast enough for him to run.

1473
01:39:02,314 --> 01:39:03,794
He's gotta run.

1474
01:39:03,794 --> 01:39:06,754
If he wins here, I've got offers
for him from all over the States.

1475
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:09,714
Bill, what about we try fitting bar shoes?

1476
01:39:09,714 --> 01:39:13,194
To support him across here
and take pressure off the split.

1477
01:39:13,194 --> 01:39:14,714
Well, has he worn them before?

1478
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:16,514
No.
No, he hasn't.

1479
01:39:16,514 --> 01:39:17,994
Well, what do you think?

1480
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,474
Well, is worth a try.

1481
01:39:19,474 --> 01:39:21,354
But you won't be able
to give him anything

1482
01:39:21,354 --> 01:39:23,354
but light track work
right up to the race.

1483
01:39:23,354 --> 01:39:24,834
Thas alright.

1484
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,314
That alright, huh?

1485
01:39:26,314 --> 01:39:27,914
We're going into
the richest race in history

1486
01:39:27,914 --> 01:39:29,714
with a horse thas half-fit and lame.

1487
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,352
Thas wonderful.

1488
01:39:51,474 --> 01:39:53,474
Jimmy, what the hell
is happening with Phar Lap?

1489
01:39:53,474 --> 01:39:55,274
Baron, there's no problem.

1490
01:39:55,274 --> 01:39:58,594
There better not be. The whole
of the US is talking about the horse.

1491
01:39:58,594 --> 01:40:01,354
Did you see Walter Winchell's
column yesterday? Fantastic!

1492
01:40:01,354 --> 01:40:02,874
We're gonna have
our biggest crowd ever.

1493
01:40:02,874 --> 01:40:04,990
What the hell is he doing here?

1494
01:40:07,354 --> 01:40:10,354
A lot of money went on
to Reveille Boy yesterday.

1495
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:13,824
Yeah, I bet a lot more went into
the pockets of certain jockeys too.

1496
01:40:14,874 --> 01:40:16,354
Is Phar Lap well guarded?

1497
01:40:16,354 --> 01:40:19,790
Oh, yeah. I got Frank and
the boys with him round the clock.

1498
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:23,074
Problem is, by the time
Bert gets his story through,

1499
01:40:23,074 --> 01:40:25,274
we're not gonna have time
to get it on the streets.

1500
01:40:25,274 --> 01:40:26,754
What are we gonna do, then?

1501
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:28,874
We have two versions ready to go.

1502
01:40:28,874 --> 01:40:32,034
If he wins, "Australian
wonder horse beats the world."

1503
01:40:32,034 --> 01:40:33,514
And if he loses?

1504
01:40:33,514 --> 01:40:35,869
"New Zealand horse fails in Mexico."

1505
01:40:37,514 --> 01:40:42,514
Harry... there's something
wrong with these figures.

1506
01:40:42,514 --> 01:40:45,114
There's L2,000 missing somewhere.

1507
01:40:45,114 --> 01:40:47,114
Yeah, I had a bet.

1508
01:40:47,114 --> 01:40:48,627
On Phar Lap?

1509
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:52,514
No, on one of my colts
on Saturday. He lost.

1510
01:40:52,514 --> 01:40:55,274
Harry, you never bet.

1511
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:56,707
I did and he lost.

1512
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:00,746
L2,000?

1513
01:41:03,794 --> 01:41:05,914
Harry, if you're going to start
gambling our money away,

1514
01:41:05,914 --> 01:41:07,394
I'd like to be told.

1515
01:41:07,394 --> 01:41:11,594
We're in worse debt now than
we've ever been, do you realise that?

1516
01:41:11,594 --> 01:41:13,027
Phar Lap'll win.

1517
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:16,307
What if he doesn't?

1518
01:41:17,394 --> 01:41:18,827
He'll win at Caliente.

1519
01:41:21,394 --> 01:41:23,271
And he'll win everywhere
else he races.

1520
01:41:25,554 --> 01:41:28,474
For years, I've kidded myself
that I made that horse.

1521
01:41:28,474 --> 01:41:31,113
Truth is, he woulÿve been a
champion no matter who trained him.

1522
01:41:33,474 --> 01:41:35,354
I've got 20 colts out there with

1523
01:41:35,354 --> 01:41:37,114
blood lines as good
or better than his

1524
01:41:37,114 --> 01:41:38,672
and I've trained them
all exactly the same.

1525
01:41:39,714 --> 01:41:41,625
Every one's a dud.

1526
01:41:43,554 --> 01:41:45,306
He's a freak.

1527
01:42:02,194 --> 01:42:03,627
Dave?

1528
01:42:04,954 --> 01:42:06,434
Dave, if your horse wins today,

1529
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:09,234
get him out of here quickly
and have him guarded from here on in.

1530
01:42:09,234 --> 01:42:13,147
What are you talking about? Huh?

1531
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:18,034
Is just that...
the big syndicates here

1532
01:42:18,034 --> 01:42:19,634
have racing pretty well organised.

1533
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,434
Now, the last thing they want is
a horse coming in from the outside

1534
01:42:22,434 --> 01:42:23,914
who wins everything
and can't be bought.

1535
01:42:23,914 --> 01:42:25,914
I'll start worrying
about that if he wins.

1536
01:42:25,914 --> 01:42:27,394
But first, he's gotta win.

1537
01:42:27,394 --> 01:42:29,034
Yeah.

1538
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:31,787
Just... keep him clear
of the pack, thas all.

1539
01:42:33,554 --> 01:42:35,074
Oh, there's a rumour going around

1540
01:42:35,074 --> 01:42:36,674
that some of the jockeys
have been paid

1541
01:42:36,674 --> 01:42:38,274
to keep him boxed in on the rails.

1542
01:42:38,274 --> 01:42:41,194
Look, Dave, if something's
good, thas OK.

1543
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:44,914
But if something's too good,
it upsets the whole system.

1544
01:42:44,914 --> 01:42:46,347
Be careful, eh?

1545
01:42:50,274 --> 01:42:52,314
RACE CALLER: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:42:52,314 --> 01:42:55,274
the horses for the 13th
race on the program

1547
01:42:55,274 --> 01:42:56,946
are now in the walking ring.

1548
01:42:58,194 --> 01:42:59,674
Now, listen to me closely.

01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:02,354
I want you to take him
out to the front of the bunch

1550
01:43:02,354 --> 01:43:05,154
right from the start - they're gonna
try to box you in on the rails...

1551
01:43:05,154 --> 01:43:07,554
He can't start fast, ill put
too much strain on the hoof!

1552
01:43:07,554 --> 01:43:10,227
I said, he starts fast
and that is an order!

1553
01:43:14,914 --> 01:43:17,194
Alright, now don't forget, Billy.

1554
01:43:17,194 --> 01:43:19,230
You take him out front,
you take him out fast.

1555
01:43:20,714 --> 01:43:22,194
Dave?

1556
01:43:22,194 --> 01:43:25,152
Not now, not now, sir, please. Do
me a favour. I'll talk to you later.

1557
01:43:27,074 --> 01:43:29,634
Billy, hold him back at the start.

1558
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:31,994
Take him out wide and
go right 'round the outside.

1559
01:43:31,994 --> 01:43:34,554
Who's giving the orders
round here, you or Davis?

1560
01:43:34,554 --> 01:43:37,394
Me. Hold him back and take him wide.

1561
01:43:37,394 --> 01:43:39,794
I'll have to cover a hell
of a lot of extra ground.

1562
01:43:39,794 --> 01:43:41,834
Billy, do what you're told.
You'll get there.

1563
01:43:41,834 --> 01:43:43,314
What if the hoof goes?

1564
01:43:43,314 --> 01:43:44,794
Pull him up straightaway.

fine field of gentlemen on their way

1581
01:45:16,234 --> 01:45:17,994
for a distance of 1.25 miles.

1582
01:45:17,994 --> 01:45:19,473
MAN: Get ready, gentlemen.

01:46:00,154 --> 01:46:04,354
It looks like the Australian champion
is not gonna run his race today.

1599
01:46:04,354 --> 01:46:06,874
As the field moves
to the clubhouse turn,

1600
01:46:06,874 --> 01:46:08,474
Joe Flores on the inside...

1601
01:46:08,474 --> 01:46:09,954

Is Phar Lap showing the way
by a length and a quarter...

1623
01:47:08,434 --> 01:47:10,394
Whoa, thas the champion.

1624
01:47:10,394 --> 01:47:13,034
It appears that he's faltering,
jockey pulling up.

1625
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:14,634
He's having trouble.
TOM: Watch behind ya!

1626
01:47:14,634 --> 01:47:16,354
As Phar Lap is pulling up,

1627
01:47:16,354 --> 01:47:20,034
Reveille Boy charges up on
the outside now to take the lead.

On the inside, is Phar Lap,

Is Phar Lap, the winner!

1634
01:48:29,354 --> 01:48:30,787
Mr Telford?

1635
01:48:37,714 --> 01:48:40,754
Mr Telford, can you have a few
words with me about the tragedy?

1636
01:48:40,754 --> 01:48:42,314
Leave me alone.

1637
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:43,794
Well, why is it, do you think,

1638
01:48:43,794 --> 01:48:46,154
that there's been this incredible
reaction to Phar Lap's death?

1639
01:48:46,154 --> 01:48:48,474
After all, he was just a horse.

1640
01:48:48,474 --> 01:48:50,704
He wasn't JUST a horse!

1641
01:48:52,674 --> 01:48:54,471
He was the best.
