1
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:47,556
What! You scared me.

2
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:51,097
I know. Look, the car is temporarily
out of order.

3
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,235
It will be ready in a minute.

4
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,047
- Get this thing out of here now.
- Get a move on.

5
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,185
Wait, guys. Don't get excited.

6
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,217
I'm trying to get this thing...

7
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,413
Would you move your car
out of the way?

8
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:17,388
I'm very sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

9
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:20,791
It always starts sooner or later
if we're really patient.

10
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,788
This happens a lot,
and I'm gonna be okay.

11
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,551
Can you open the door?

12
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,387
- Can you open the door?
- I can't. Look!

13
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,763
See. See this thing?

14
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:30,091
It's always been that way.
I can't open it.

15
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,325
- Oh, God.
- Get this thing out of here.

16
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,697
- I don't blame you.
- You've got to move.

17
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,735
I'd open the door, but I can't.

18
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,237
I can't. I'm locked in here.

19
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,842
I'm gonna have an anxiety attack.
Oh, no.

20
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,287
This is great.
Gosh, thank you so much.

21
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,480
- Anytime.
- I'm so late.

22
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,125
Second time this week.

23
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,395
- I'm late.
- You are?

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,725
Yeah.

25
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,271
Lou's gonna kill me.

26
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,970
<i>If tonight's banquet</i>
<i>in honor of the visiting...</i>

27
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,672
<i>... Emir Khala'ad bin Abdul Majid has</i>
<i>its desired effect...</i>

28
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:23,944
<i>... State Department insiders predict</i>
<i>that administrators will announce...</i>

29
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:27,054
<i>... the start of construction</i>
<i>on a major military base...</i>

30
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:31,694
<i>... in the emir's strategically</i>
<i>located Middle Eastern country.</i>

31
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,157
<i>State Department...</i>

32
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:37,163
<i>Presidential aide John J. Hilley was</i>
<i>accused of being overly ambitious...</i>

33
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,733
<i>... and overly zealous</i>
<i>by several congressmen...</i>

34
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,837
<i>Brad, not in the middle</i>
<i>of the afternoon.</i>

35
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,873
<i>Kim, middle of the afternoon, middle</i>
<i>of the night. What's the difference?</i>

36
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:50,204
<i>Brad, we can't. It's just not right.</i>

37
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:54,440
<i>Right? I'll show you what's right.</i>
<i>This is right.</i>

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,617
<i>This.</i>

39
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,519
<i>And this.</i>

40
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:10,290
Hi, sweetie. I'm late.

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,058
- The car?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:18,167
Oh, taxi! Taxi!

43
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,141
- Hey, Sunny, no car?
- No car.

44
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,479
- Can I give you a ride home?
- No, thanks. I got a date!

45
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,523
- Hi, Lou.
- Nice, Sunny.

46
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,393
Nice. Thank you very much
for showing up.

47
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,828
Oh, jeez, am I late?

48
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,560
Why were you running
if you didn't know?

49
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,102
Exercise.

50
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,805
Funny, very funny.
See, I can't pay my taxes here.

51
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,739
- The joint's dying...
- I'm real sorry.

52
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,379
I'll be on time
the rest of the week, okay?

53
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,378
What rest of the week? It's Friday.

54
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,949
You can make it up
by working cleanup tonight.

55
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,484
Lou, not tonight, please.
I have a date.

56
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,178
Sunny, you going out?

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,448
Guess.

58
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:12,620
- The Friday night special.
- Come on, Donna, give me a break.

59
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,263
He's not so bad. What do you expect,
for chrissakes?

60
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:19,094
This is D.C. The men are all married
or gay or work for the government.

61
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,360
Or all three.

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,095
- How come you got the zebra?
- I got here first.

63
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,102
Does that mean I get the giraffe?

64
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,936
No, Francine has the giraffe tonight.

65
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,872
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,014
Oh, no way!

67
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,107
No way! There's absolutely
no way I'm...

68
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,183
What's the matter?

69
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:40,754
I will not walk around this place
dressed like a goddamn chicken!

70
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,221
That is not a chicken.
That is an emu.

71
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,690
An "emu"?
I never heard of an emu.

72
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,728
Nobody I know ever heard of an emu.
So wear it yourself.

73
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,399
No, dear, I'm not a chicken.
I'm an emu.

74
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,265
That's "emu." E-M-U.

75
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,833
No, sweetie, I will not sit
on your eggs.

76
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:05,378
I gotta get something together for
my car, which had a breakdown today.

77
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:06,809
I am so broke.

78
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,814
See that guy over there?
The one with the green jacket.

79
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,043
Yeah.

80
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,585
He's looking for a good time.

81
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,689
He'll have trouble finding it.

82
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,052
I know you don't go
for stuff like that...

83
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,559
...but the guy gave me 10 bucks
for an introduction.

84
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:23,357
- An introduction, that's all.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,625
Tell him I said, "How do you do?"

86
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,504
Hey, Sunshine, listen to me.

87
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:34,733
I've got a couple extra hundred bucks
that I'm not doing anything with.

88
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,105
You wouldn't have
to pay me back right away.

89
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,146
- I'm okay, Ella, really.
- I'm serious.

90
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,647
- You know my friend I told you about?
- Sure.

91
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:46,515
He's been real generous lately.
Real generous, know what I mean?

92
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,121
I think so.

93
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:49,850
See this.

94
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,186
- Now, don't tell anyone. It's real.
- Wow!

95
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,160
See these? They're not.

96
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,162
He paid for all three.

97
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:01,894
Now, listen, my friend
has some friends...

98
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:04,335
...very nice guys.

99
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,805
- You should go out with them.
- No, Ella, I couldn't.

100
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,443
I didn't say you're lying.

101
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:14,275
I said I find it very interesting that
you used the same excuse last week.

102
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,475
No, that was last week!

103
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,655
Your sister's kids' measles
was the week before.

104
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,916
I'm not yelling,
I'm just speaking distinctly!

105
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,324
No, you can't come over later.
Later is the middle of the night.

106
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,761
While we're on the subject
I want to say something...

107
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,432
- God, it's got to get better.
- Does it?

108
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,165
Doesn't it?

109
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,268
Sure it does.

110
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,412
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, honey.

111
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,146
Among the celebrities we expect to see
tonight are the president himself...

112
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:57,087
...and his honored guest,
the Emir Khala'ad bin Abdul Majid.

113
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:00,057
Washington insiders consider
tonight's gala the beginning...

114
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:03,198
...of attempts on the part
of the administration...

115
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,368
...to arrange a strategic deal
with the emir.

116
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,097
It would involve the establishment of
a major American military presence...

117
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,207
...in that Middle Eastern country.

118
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,778
Although the emir struggled for years
to reconcile dissident factions...

119
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,540
...within his traditionally
conservative nation...

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,776
...he is considered powerful enough,
if not popular enough...

121
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:27,581
...to assure his own people that
the long-term economic benefits...

122
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,624
...from such an arrangement would help
his suffering country.

123
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,658
Excuse me.

124
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,824
Who is it? Is it the president?

125
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,371
- Mrs. St. John, just one more.
- Elizabeth!

126
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,162
How are you?

127
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:50,743
This is our car.

128
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,154
Ouch.

129
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,051
What do you got in there, a gun?

130
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,449
A gun?

131
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,018
A gun!

132
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,422
A gun!

133
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,472
I got him! I got him!

134
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,474
He got me! He got me!

135
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,940
<i>At approximately 11:45,</i>
<i>when the president's banquet...</i>

136
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,714
<i>... in honor of the visit of the Emir</i>
<i>Khala'ad bin Abdul Majid was ending...</i>

137
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,290
<i>... and the would-be assassin</i>
<i>appeared in the crowd...</i>

138
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,452
<i>The information we have</i>
<i>developed so far reveals...</i>

139
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,964
<i>... that the name of that real-life</i>
<i>heroine is Sunny Ann Davis.</i>

140
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,860
<i>Her selfless act</i>
<i>in the face of danger...</i>

141
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,040
<i>The waitress threw herself</i>
<i>in the path of the bullet...</i>

142
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:53,765
<i>... from a would-be killer's gun.</i>

143
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:54,874
- Jerry.
- What?

144
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:55,975
It's Sunny.

145
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,978
<i>There is still no word as to her</i>
<i>condition. On the lighter side...</i>

146
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:02,911
<i>No identification yet</i>
<i>of the gun-wielding man who...</i>

147
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,815
<i>... to the horror</i>
<i>of terrified witnesses...</i>

148
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,616
<i>... made his abortive attempt</i>
<i>on the life of the emir.</i>

149
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:13,619
<i>We have not been told how serious</i>
<i>the brave Ms. Davis' condition is...</i>

150
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,252
Oh, my God!

151
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,092
<i>... or even where,</i>
<i>precisely, she was wounded.</i>

152
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,029
Forceps.

153
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,302
I think I've got it.

154
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,981
Suture, please.

155
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,687
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

156
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,254
Thank you.

157
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,393
<i>How did you happen to be there?</i>

158
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:53,898
<i>I was coming out of the hotel.</i>
<i>I was working 7- 11 that night.</i>

159
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:57,197
<i>But I was late at this time</i>
<i>because of all the C.A.</i>

160
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,006
<i>- C.A.?</i>
<i>- Citizen activity.</i>

161
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,610
<i>- I don't know that technical jargon...</i>
<i>- Security guard talk, Bob.</i>

162
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,210
<i>What did you think when</i>
<i>you heard the shots?</i>

163
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,147
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"My God, somebody's shooting."</i>

164
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:14,152
<i>And the man that was firing.</i>
<i>Did you actually see him?</i>

165
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:19,226
<i>Yeah, I'd clocked him a while before,</i>
<i>because he was a bit funny.</i>

166
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,329
<i>I figured. "What the heck.</i>

167
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,694
<i>He's just a fanatic who hangs</i>
<i>around when something's going on. "</i>

168
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,927
<i>- What did you do?</i>
<i>- There wasn't anything I could do.</i>

169
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,538
<i>There was no reason. At the</i>
<i>Craigmore School of Security...</i>

170
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,006
<i>... we're told never to impede</i>
<i>on an individual's rights.</i>

171
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,872
<i>Even after he pulled his weapon out?</i>

172
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,707
<i>Then you go right into standard</i>
<i>operating procedure.</i>

173
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,180
<i>What would standard operating</i>
<i>procedure be in this case?</i>

174
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,946
<i>In this particular case, I forgot.</i>

175
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,052
<i>Do you remember how many shots</i>
<i>were fired?</i>

176
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,059
<i>Sure, yeah.</i>
<i>Between two and...</i>

177
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:58,732
<i>Between about three and eight.</i>
<i>Or nine.</i>

178
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:02,802
<i>She is behind me in one of the rooms</i>
<i>of the George Washington Hospital...</i>

179
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:06,133
<i>... and according to the latest</i>
<i>bulletin, she's fine.</i>

180
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,867
There's a rumor that someone
from the White House...

181
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:10,545
...perhaps the president...

182
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,976
...will pay a visit
to this young lady...

183
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:17,380
...whose unusual display of
bravery, of intestinal fortitude...

184
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:21,454
...of old-fashioned American guts,
have thrust her into the harsh...

185
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,820
...yet warm and grateful
light of media attention.

186
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:26,585
Will you give these to Sunny?

187
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,890
They're from the United
Ladies for a Better America!

188
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,862
I'm her cousin on her mother's side.

189
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,659
Look. Don't I look like her?

190
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,064
Look at me! Don't I look like her?

191
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:44,106
I'm afraid I can't comment
at the moment on this.

192
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,011
There will be a press conference
this morning.

193
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,586
Check me out! I'm a personal friend
of Norman Mailer!

194
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,649
Thank you.

195
00:12:58,961 --> 00:12:59,950
Give us a break!

196
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:05,125
- More mail!
- More mail, Sunny. More mail!

197
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,603
I'm visiting my friend Sunny,
the national hero.

198
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,136
I'll call back later.
Or better yet, call me.

199
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,807
Lou Fox of the Safari Club.

200
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,602
Mom, you should see this room.
It's beautiful!

201
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,210
It's like a honeymoon suite.

202
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,610
I've got pictures. I can see
the Capitol from the window.

203
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,875
Look at this. From Wayne Newton.

204
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,382
- More mail.
- More mail!

205
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,680
This is so exciting. I can't...

206
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,947
Barry Manilow.

207
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:30,182
Mom, listen, I think
I'm coming home soon.

208
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,360
Yeah, they're gonna pay for it.

209
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,893
Yeah, they're paying...
Who are you?

210
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,496
I'm Mike Ransome.

211
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,634
I'm the Middle East desk chief
over at the State Department.

212
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,936
I'm here to help you get through
your press conference.

213
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,999
Mom, I'll call you back.
Give my love to Dad.

214
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,665
Okay, bye-bye.

215
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,512
You sure don't look like one.

216
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:54,205
- Like one what?
- A middle-aged desk clerk.

217
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,143
No, no, that's Middle East desk chief.

218
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,486
- More mail.
- More mail!

219
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:05,258
- You're hearing from a lot of people?
- Liza Minnelli!

220
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,589
This is a list of 90 names.
All marriage proposals.

221
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,196
Well, I may have to turn
some of them down.

222
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,993
Are you married, Mr. Ransome?

223
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:17,570
Hey, Donna, come on.
Give the guy a break, okay?

224
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,668
I mean, really.

225
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:23,572
- Are you married, Mr. Ransome?
- Not anymore.

226
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,707
- Congratulations, neither am I.
- I know.

227
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,816
Oh, yeah? What else do you know?

228
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:31,578
I know that we don't have much time.

229
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,881
If you'll just let me fill you in
on this material...

230
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:40,860
This map is part of the background
material we're giving to the press.

231
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:44,261
Here is the emir's country.

232
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,367
- In yellow?
- Yes.

233
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,197
And pretty. It's a pretty
little country.

234
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:52,465
You cannot help but discern
its strategic importance...

235
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,269
...to the West in terms
of its proximity to the Gulf.

236
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,711
And its value as a buffer,
geographically speaking...

237
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:02,077
...between these two rival nations.

238
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,148
Wow.

239
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,049
<i>Dr. Pearlman, chief of surgery at</i>
<i>George Washington University Hospital.</i>

240
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:12,557
<i>He's finishing his report on</i>
<i>the details of Ms. Davis' condition.</i>

241
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,992
<i>The young lady herself,</i>
<i>in the center of all...</i>

242
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:17,859
Mr. Hilley's office.

243
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,131
Would you hold a moment, senator?

244
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,597
Can you speak with Senator Miller?

245
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,566
Tell him I'll call him back
when this is over.

246
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,265
I want to watch it.

247
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,071
I apologize, senator.

248
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,045
Can Mr. Hilley call you back as soon
as this press conference is over?

249
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:35,682
It won't be but a minute.

250
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,852
Wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye.

251
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:41,750
<i>Let's take our cameras down as Sunny</i>
<i>Davis is wheeled to the microphone.</i>

252
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:53,160
- Would you like to speak first?
- No, not really.

253
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,096
Well, yes.

254
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:09,009
Well, I'd like to say thank you...

255
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,517
...to everybody at the hospital...

256
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,315
...for being so nice and taking
such good care of me.

257
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,791
<i>And I'd like to tell everybody</i>
<i>in America...</i>

258
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:23,294
<i>... that this is the best place to come</i>
<i>if you're ever shot in the ass.</i>

259
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,569
- Is the chief watching this?
- Don't know.

260
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:32,330
- What did he say when you talked?
- He was napping.

261
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,169
Can you tell us what you're going
to do next?

262
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,846
Well, I'm gonna go home
to Oregon and visit my folks.

263
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,378
<i>And relax and see what new things</i>
<i>my dad's invented in his workshop.</i>

264
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:48,681
<i>And check on my dog and eat some</i>
<i>of my mom's huckleberry pie...</i>

265
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,825
<i>... which is the best in the world.</i>

266
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:55,463
Jesus Christ, what is
this cornball routine?

267
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,558
- Look at them.
- Who?

268
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,325
Them. The hard-boiled press.

269
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,396
They're eating it up.

270
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:06,368
Then there's my grandma and grandpa
who I haven't seen in a long time.

271
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,567
Gosh, they're in their 70s
and in really great shape.

272
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,338
<i>Grandma still volunteers</i>
<i>as a crossing guard.</i>

273
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,709
She's gonna sing
the national anthem next.

274
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,080
<i>Hi, Grandma. If you're watching,</i>
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

275
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,188
I'll bet Grandpa was personally
decorated by Eisenhower.

276
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,450
<i>My grandfather used</i>
<i>to pitch for the Salem Rockets...</i>

277
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,719
<i>...which was an AA league.</i>
- Even better.

278
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,421
<i>He was MVP two years running,</i>
<i>and we're very proud of him.</i>

279
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,100
- Maybe she's running for office.
- Come on.

280
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,634
To be that dumb and run for office?

281
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,406
- What about your personal life?
- What about it?

282
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,737
For starters, you live
with two men. Is that right?

283
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,948
- No.
- It isn't?

284
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,280
I live in a small part of a house that
belongs to two men who live together.

285
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,385
You understand the difference.

286
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,958
<i>Let's go on to something else then.</i>

287
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,322
When you first realized
that the alleged assailant...

288
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,789
<i>Alleged? You want to see alleged?</i>

289
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,433
<i>I'll show you alleged.</i>

290
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,965
I've seen enough.

291
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,736
Would you get the president
for me, please?

292
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:15,671
She's got the working women,
the small-town folks...

293
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,108
...the senior citizens, the gays,
the law-and-order bunch!

294
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:22,079
And the baseball fans and the barflies
and the animal lovers!

295
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,582
- Margaret!
- Yes. Yes, sir.

296
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:27,483
Make sure the line to the hospital
is clear. Patch it through now!

297
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,281
Do it! Do it!

298
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,619
She really is something, sir.

299
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,290
Truthfully, I never heard
of the emir before last night.

300
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:38,022
I wasn't risking my life
for him or anything.

301
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,997
<i>I thought he was trying</i>
<i>to shoot the president.</i>

302
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,831
- Tell him to make the call now.
- He's talking.

303
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,366
I didn't say "give my life,"
I said "risk."

304
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,769
He is our president.

305
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,332
No, sir.

306
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,107
Yes, sir.

307
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:54,771
No.

308
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:58,014
Do you support the president
generally?

309
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,881
Do you think he's doing a good job?

310
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,955
He gets paid a lot more than me,
so he must be doing something right.

311
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:05,023
Make the call!

312
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,855
- Did you vote for the president?
- I never voted.

313
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,054
- Never?
- Right, never.

314
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,200
Do you consider yourself
a Republican or a Democrat?

315
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,902
<i>Look, I consider myself to be</i>
<i>just an American.</i>

316
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,537
Tell him to make the goddamn call!

317
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:30,111
There's a call here that some
of you may want to listen to.

318
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,812
Who is it?

319
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,116
Hello?

320
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:41,728
<i>Mr. President?</i>

321
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,456
It's the president!

322
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:58,544
<i>From Washington D.C.,</i>
<i>CNN Headline News, top story...</i>

323
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,146
<i>I'd like to tell everybody</i>

324

<i>Tonight, Sunny Davis speaks up.</i>

326
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,779
<i>Hi, Grandma...</i>

327
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:12,222
<i>Sunny on Monday at 7:30.</i>

328
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:16,925
<i>From Hollywood,</i> The Tonight Show,
<i>starring Johnny Carson.</i>

329
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,067
<i>Tonight, Johnny's one and only guest,</i>
<i>Sunny Davis.</i>

330
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,964
<i>She's got the gun here. See?</i>

331
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,694
<i>Okay, now run please, run.</i>

332
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,307
<i>Now she's opening her mouth.</i>
<i>See? She's opening her mouth.</i>

333
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:29,534
<i>- She's determined.</i>
<i>- She pulls him down.</i>

334
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:33,203
<i>See, there it is. She bites him here.</i>
<i>And he screams...</i>

335
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:36,349
<i>Coming up: saints, sinners</i>
<i>and Sunny Davis.</i>

336
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,787
<i>Good evening, tonight's lead story,</i>
<i>the celebrity of Sunny Davis.</i>

337
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,048
<i>Do you think you'd do this again?</i>

338
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,725
<i>Stay tuned, the news continues.</i>

339
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,312
Oh, absolutely, Your Majesty.

340
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,778
No problem.

341
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,348
And we get the base?

342
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:47,848
- He really said that?
- Yes, Marietta, he really said that.

343
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:51,387
Well, I'm convinced.

344
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,959
Yes, but are we really being
fair to her?

345
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,995
It's an extremely volatile situation.
She's a totally inexperienced...

346
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,668
She's a drink hustler
in a clip joint.

347
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,360
We're giving her a shot.
You think she'll say no?

348
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,037
Coffee, gentlemen?

349
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:10,034
- Shouldn't the president know?
- I don't think so, Michael.

350
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,045
You're right, Marietta. I think
we can handle this among ourselves.

351
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,945
Besides, it's almost 9:30.

352
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,882
The president has retired.
He has a difficult day tomorrow.

353
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,578
Yeah, he has to get up.

354
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,352
Early. Get up early.

355
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,928
Okay, who can we get to go talk
to the girl and impress her?

356
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,100
Let's think. There must be someone.

357
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,728
Someone who's
reasonably good-natured...

358
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,874
...has a relatively high TVQ...

359
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,976
...and nothing important to do.

360
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,184
<i>This is the first time anyone like the</i>
<i>vice president has visited our city.</i>

361
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,952
<i>But the governor is here a lot</i>
<i>to visit his sister Clara...</i>

362
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,526
<i>...who lives just outside of town.</i>
<i>- We're sure proud of that.</i>

363
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:04,332
<i>Here's the Cougar band coming around</i>
<i>the corner at Main and Superior.</i>

364
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,296
<i>Right past Schmitter's Hardware.</i>

365
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,933
<i>Sunny Davis graduated in the top 75%</i>
<i>of her class at Diamond Junction High.</i>

366
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,076
<i>She was a pep girl, a member</i>
<i>of the hair-dressing club...</i>

367
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,439

<i>Laurel, describe some</i>
<i>of the fashions here.</i>

369
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:26,453
<i>Well, Sunny Davis is wearing a</i>
<i>red smock, I guess you'd call it.</i>

370
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,350
<i>The vice president is wearing a suit.</i>

371
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,800
<i>There's Mayor Bernholtz.</i>

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,868
<i>He'll give Sunny, Diamond Junction's</i>
<i>version of the key to our city...</i>

373
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,265
<i>... the gold chain saw...</i>

374
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,805

376
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,715
Bless you!

377
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,279
Thank you.

378
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,855
Come on, boy. Come on.

379
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:43,153
Here, come on!

380
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,833
Here it is. Here you go, boy.
Come on.

381
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:48,362
Give it to me.

382
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,559
Come on.

383
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:53,001
What do you think?

384
00:24:55,143 --> 00:24:56,167
Really fine.

385
00:24:56,378 --> 00:25:00,075
- You think so, honest?
- Absolutely. I do.

386
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,950
It's like a real professional job.

387
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,047
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

388
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:08,051
My own cleaners back
in D.C. couldn't do it.

389
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,520
- Which ones?
- Top Hat and Tails Express.

390
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:11,749
- On 4th Street?
- Yes.

391
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,154
- Near the court?
- Yes.

392
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:16,694
They're terrible. They once
ruined a blouse of mine.

393
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:21,267
It was very delicate material.
It was very fragile.

394
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,962
Yes.

395
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:27,171
- And they ripped it to shreds.
- Really?

396
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,302
Shreds.

397
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:34,072
It's hard to believe what so-called
professionals will do, you know?

398
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,848
I think so, yes.

399
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,888
Because professionals, well,
they don't always care, you know?

400
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,815
Anyway...

401
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,659
Let me take them in.

402
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:50,160
- I want to do the cuffs.
- It's not necessary.

403
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,491
Necessary?

404
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,930
Are you kidding?
This is an honor for me.

405
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,399
This is another major event
in my life.

406
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,774
Well, I must say, this is very
impressive, Mrs. Davis.

407
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,704
Isn't this impressive, Michael?

408
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,400
Yes, sir. Certainly is, sir.

409
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,671
Just what is that vegetable dish,
might I ask?

410
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,679
That's another of Dad's inventions.

411
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,784
- It is?
- Aspara-barb.

412
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,512
- How's that?
- Cross between asparagus and rhubarb.

413
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:16,315
I grow the stuff out back.

414
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,389
Looks like hell, but it's delicious.

415
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,561
I'll bet it is.

416
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:24,030
Mr. Davis has developed
quite a few original notions.

417
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,359
Later, I'll take you
to the basement...

418
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,401
...and show you something
that'll knock your socks off.

419
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,835
Really? What might that be?

420
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,302
Not now, dear.

421
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,102
Could save our country 50%
of its water bills.

422
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:39,303
- After dinner, Dad.
- 50% of its water bills?

423
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,005
Yes, I'd be interested
in hearing about that.

424
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:43,445
It's an electric toilet.

425
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,249
You won't forget the experience,
I guarantee it.

426
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,153
Later, Dad.

427
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:57,029
Popcorn! Popcorn!

428
00:26:57,232 --> 00:27:00,497
Don't jump on the nice
Mr. Vice President.

429
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,535
- You want me to get rid of him?
- No, absolutely not.

430
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:05,103
Not at all.

431
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:07,032
Nice dog.

432
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,413
- I wonder why you call him Popcorn?
- That was his father's name.

433
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,082
Of course.

434
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:20,084
- So, let's talk about the future.
- Okay.

435
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,222
First of all, how is...?

436
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,821
That's just about as good as new.

437
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,927
You'd have to look very close
to see the scar.

438
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,757
Well, I'll take your word for it.

439
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,569
Sunny, what are your plans?

440
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,773
I don't have any.

441
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,101
I mean, well, I have a job
at the Safari Club.

442
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:46,474
Lou, well he's my boss,
and he's really a nice guy...

443
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:48,148
...but business is slow.

444
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,649
And I was kind of hoping
for an advancement, you know.

445
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:55,584
But Lou's aunt works the cash register
and his sister's the hostess.

446
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:00,090
So I'm gonna have to wait around
until one of them quits or drops dead.

447
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,523
I guess you know what that's like.

448
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,490
Sunny...

449
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,594
...we want you to come
and work with us.

450
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,295
What do you mean?

451
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:16,671
Well, we think you've proven yourself
to be a truly valuable citizen.

452
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:18,846
You'd be a valuable
addition to our team.

453
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,642
- Are you kidding?
- No.

454
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,722
Well, oh, my gosh,
what would I be doing?

455
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:32,316
Well, you'd be acting as a special
assistant to Ambassador St. John.

456
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,621
- Do you know who that is?
- I don't know.

457
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,298
No, I don't think so.
I know I don't know.

458
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,229
- Who is he?
- She.

459
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:41,732
She? She's a she?

460
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:45,167
She's the head of a department
of government that we think...

461
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,273
...you'd be well-suited for.

462
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,503
And what department is that?

463
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:51,501
Protocol.

464
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,341
Protocol.

465
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,177
That's... Gosh, that's...

466
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,183
I don't believe it. Protocol?

467
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,091
Protocol!

468
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:11,721
Could you just...?

469
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:15,164
I'll be right back.
Could you just wait here?

470
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll just be right back.

471
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:18,864
Protocol.

472
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:26,311
You won't believe what just happened.

473
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:28,112
What happened?

474
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,818
- What's wrong with you?
- P-R-O-T-O-K...

475
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,725
Wait a minute, guys.

476
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,158
"Protocol: the customs
and regulations...

477
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,231
...dealing with the ceremonies and
etiquette of the diplomatic corps."

478
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,132
It's a job.

479
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:49,598
She just got a job.

480
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,734
It's a job. They want me
to work for them.

481
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:53,965
Work where?

482
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:57,107
Oh, thank you!

483
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:03,806
Exactly where would I be working?

484
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,479
The State Department.

485
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:09,817
I was wondering, does a job like that
pay by the hour or the week or what?

486
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,323
Well, for a start,
about 35,000 a year.

487
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,810
<i>"Dear Falcon: Pigeon in cage.</i>
<i>Signed, Eagle. "</i>

488
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:50,622
Dad, these books
the Protocol Department sent...

489
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,527
...are filled with weird rules.

490
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,498
"Never cross your legs in front
of an African chief...

491
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:59,434
...because the sole of the shoe
is considered an insult."

492
00:31:00,008 --> 00:31:01,475
I better be more careful!

493
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:06,010
Oh, God, you wouldn't believe all
the rules they've got in this book.

494
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,847
Half of them don't make sense at all.

495
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,740
I don't know how I'll learn it all.

496
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,817
Stop worrying.
You're like your mother.

497
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:14,917
You'll do okay.

498
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,556
I just hope I don't screw up.

499
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:17,884
- You won't.
- There's so much...

500
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:19,252
You won't.

501
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,429
Before you go, I want to
tell you how proud I am of you.

502
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,622
What you did, grabbing
that assassin and all.

503
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,324
That's the first time
you ever said anything like that.

504
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:31,130
It's the first time you ever
did anything like that.

505
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:54,255
- Excuse me.
- Hello, Sunny.

506
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:57,056
I'm Earl Crowe,
and I'm real happy you're here.

507
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:01,065
I'm the deputy chief of Protocol.
But you can call me Earl.

508
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:04,170
And I'm going to take you in
to meet the boss.

509
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:05,304
Mrs. St. John?

510
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,031
That's right.
She's a wild woman, Sunny.

511
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:11,211
A wild woman.
She's tough, but she's fair.

512
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:15,143
She works 26 hours a day
and gives you 200 percent.

513
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,318
She must be exhausted.

514
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,452
But seriously, Sunny, how is that hip?

515
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,150
- Great.
- That's wonderful.

516
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,121
The one where the
bullet went in still aches.

517
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,687
There she is!

518
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:34,991
This flower is from every one of us.

519
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,501
Oh, thank you.

520
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:39,839
Thank you very much.

521
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,442
Sunny, Sunny, Sunny, Sunny.

522
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,574
Sunny.

523
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:48,742
Do you know what you've done?

524
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,107
What?

525
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,251
You don't have the slightest
idea what you've done?

526
00:32:56,924 --> 00:33:00,690
- I don't think so.
- You really don't?

527
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:06,493
Well, whatever it is, I know that
I can fix it, or clean it up, or...

528
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:10,193
Oh, she's priceless.
Priceless!

529
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,570
You brought us together.

530
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:19,975
And now I think I have something for
you that will please you very much.

531
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,115
- This is where I'll be working?
- Yes.

532
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:23,806
Oh, and this is my phone...

533
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:25,679
With your own extension.

534
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:28,583
Oh, this is very exciting
for me, ma'am.

535
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,052
I'm sure it is, dear.

536
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,918
You know, Sunny...

537
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:36,460
...you must prepare yourself
for all kinds of new experiences.

538
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,788
I guess so.

539
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:41,332
You must learn to accept
new sights, new sounds...

540
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:44,403
...new, exotic fragrances, so to speak.

541
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,405
Ambassador St. John,
your call to the Austrian council.

542
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,702
You must be exhausted
from your trip...

543
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,746
...so I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

544
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:57,547
The limousine
will pick you up at 7.

545
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:59,117
What limousine is that, ma'am?

546
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,019
Tonight's reception will be quite
formal, so wear something pretty.

547
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,124
Sunny...

548
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,161
...I think you're going to have
a remarkable future.

549
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,990
Even sooner than you think.

550
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,964
They talk funny.

551
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:19,230
Funny, how?

552
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,840
They say things
they don't really say...

553
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:24,705
...but I can't figure out
what the hell it is.

554
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:29,847
Jerry...

555
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,845
...tell me the truth.

556
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:35,784
Am I one of those, " Oh, yeah,
she's really a lot of fun...

557
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,949
...she's got a sense of humor, but
she's not a bright kind of people"?

558
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,152
Come on, Sunny, don't be ridiculous.

559
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,422
You're a very bright kind of people.

560
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,493
Oh, thank you.

561
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,303
Thank you.

562
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,238
What are you gonna be
doing specifically?

563
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:54,931
Well, specifically, I don't know.

564
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:58,340
But whatever it is, I know
it will include new sights...

565
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:00,480
...and new, exotic fragrances.

566
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,539
Your own line of fragrances?

567
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,584
John J. Hilley, White House.

568
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,490
- Sunny Davis.
- Pat Hassler.

569
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,685
Sunny Davis.

570
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,366
The president asked me
to deliver a message.

571
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,091
- You're kidding.
- Absolutely not.

572
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:24,465
He said that he's extremely proud
that you're with us.

573
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:25,832
Did he really say that?

574
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,635
Yes, he also knows you're ready to do
whatever your country asks of you.

575
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:32,244
He's got his eye on you, Sunny.

576
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:34,604
Sunny!

577
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:36,074
Mr. Crowe.

578
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:39,481
- How really interesting you look.
- Thank you.

579
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:41,587
Meet the Belgian ambassador.

580
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:44,417
This is Sunny Davis, Your Excellency.

581
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:48,889
- Bravo, Sunny.
- Bravo, Your Excellency.

582
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,254
And you too, ma'am.

583
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,827
You sure have a great little country.

584
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:55,093
That's the girl.

585
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,635
- Have you ever been to Belgium?
- No.

586
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,330
No, actually, I haven't been anywhere.

587
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,771
I mean outside of this country,
I mean.

588
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:06,777
I was in Canada once, but that
doesn't count because it's attached.

589
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:09,108
- Sunny Davis?
- Yes.

590
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,410
Oh, is something wrong?

591
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,610
Should I get my coat?

592
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:15,918
- Welcome back.
- Hi!

593
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:17,784
Oh, gosh, I want to thank you.

594
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:21,519
Hey, guys, you know what?
I'm a personal friend of the emir.

595
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,628
Sunny.

596
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,738
You scared me.

597
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,036
Sunny, dear...

598
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,643
...have you ever met a wise man?

599
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:42,247
- Personally, you mean?
- Yes, personally.

600
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,749
- Oh, well, like how wise?
- Very, very wise.

601
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,251
Well, have you ever heard of
Babbanoctanondo?

602
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,151
He lived in a cave up near Salem.

603
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:52,758
He only ate things
he could get off the ground.

604
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,391
Me and my cousin went there once...

605
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,655
...and he had this
out-of-body experience...

606
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:00,800
All right! All right.

607
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:02,594
That's very interesting, dear.

608
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,967
But the point is, I would
like you to meet someone...

609
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:10,200
...who's very, very important.

610
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,538
The Nawaf Al Kabeer.

611
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,552
He's the chief temporal adviser
to the emir...

612
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:22,188
...on moral and ethical matters.

613
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,018
A man of transcendent spiritual power.

614
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,717
He can see straight
into your thoughts.

615
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,696
May I present Miss Sunny Davis.

616
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,836
Well, Mr. Nawaf, this is
a real natural high for me.

617
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,882
It means,
"Blessed are the small ones...

618
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:53,349
...who shall be made large."

619
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:57,115
Oh, I see.
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

620
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,122
And you know I read something...

621
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:02,854
What is it?

622
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:05,089
It means, "Praise be to God."

623
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,324
Oh, yes!

624
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,127
Sunny Davis.

625
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:11,134
Sunny Davis.

626
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,397
Yes?

627
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:16,542
My child, how old are you?

628
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,033
Thirty-two.

629
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,871
Thirty-three.

630
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:27,248
You see, you have become,
through your bravery...

631
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,685
...part of the history of my country.

632
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,255
Oh, that's very flattering, but...

633
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:32,653
Sunny Davis.

634
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,124
- Sunny Davis.
- Yes.

635
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:37,854
Our children praise your name.

636
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,726
You're kidding.

637
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:44,264
Our beloved emir,
Khala’ad bin Abdul Majid...

638
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,305
...remembers you in his prayers...

639
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,807
...and hopes that until
you come to him...

640
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:52,274
...until you are with us...

641
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,209
Wait, who's coming where?

642
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,442
- you will accept as evidence of his
great affection this simple gift.

643
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:00,984
Oh, honest to God, it's not necessary.

644
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:04,214
This miserable token of his esteem.

645
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,790
How miserable?

646
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:14,161
Rolls-Royce.

647
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:44,328
We are very proud of our dear Sunny,
and we remain confident...

648
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,432
...that whatever choices
Sunny makes...

649
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,469
...whether it is with us or elsewhere,
that relations between Sunny...

650
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:55,870
...and the emir will always reflect
the warmth and affection...

651
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:59,638
...our two countries have
traditionally felt for each other.

652
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:00,871
Thank you.

653
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:02,071
Sunny?

654
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:04,774
No, I'd like to say something.

655
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,922
I'd like to say that I think
the emir is really a great guy.

656
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:12,456
As for Mr. Al Kabeer
and his friends here...

657
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,595
...I've never met a nicer bunch
of foreign people.

658
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:19,732
And that car is just about
the prettiest thing I've ever seen.

659
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:24,064
It gives me a headache to tell
you that as a government employee...

660
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:26,398
...I will transfer ownership of it...

661
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,768
...to the General
Services Administration...

662
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:32,309
...and include it in a list
of gifts to an official...

663
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,413
...in the report in accordance...

664
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,482
...with federal registry order 327.

665
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,949
Crazy, I'd never do that.

666
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:48,926
<i>The car will be sent</i>
<i>to the federal repository...</i>

667
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,189
<i>... as requested,</i>
<i>where it will be...</i>

668
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,958
<i>... supervised by</i>
<i>the transportation secretary...</i>

669
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,830
<i>... who said he'd take charge</i>
<i>of the $ 119,000 car.</i>

670
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:02,099
<i>Your Majesty, it doesn't mean</i>
<i>she turned down your proposal.</i>

671
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,490
How angry would you say he was?

672
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,556
Cursing in at least four languages.

673
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,125
Let's go over our options.

674
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,455
We could give up
this mysterioso stuff...

675
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:25,188
...and tell the girl the situation.

676
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,026
Throw ourselves on her mercy?

677
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,031
No, appeal to her patriotism.

678
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,464
I don't think so.

679
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,662
I agree, it's too risky.

680
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:35,933
Large gains demand large risks.

681
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:38,338
I think she'll be able
to handle herself...

682
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:40,480
...judging from last night.

683
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:43,013
If you hadn't given
her those manuals...

684
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,117
The girl's been doing her homework.

685
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,148
Perhaps she's not
as unintelligent as you think.

686
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:50,289
Perhaps we're not
as clever as we think.

687
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:51,423
What do you mean, we?

688
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,456
You have an attitude problem?

689
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,595
Gentlemen!

690
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,699
I'm sure she'll make the sensible
choice when the time comes.

691
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,166
Until then, we just have
to keep her busy.

692
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:05,463
And out of trouble.

693
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:23,313
Majesty, allow me to introduce...

694
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:25,048
Excuse me.

695
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:27,724
My car broke down.

696
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:30,453
- welcome you
on behalf of the president...

697
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:34,500
Gun! Hit the deck!

698
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,531
I thought we were being attacked!
I'm sorry!

699
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,060
You said it was a barbecue.

700
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,631
Sunny, let's be clear about
the procedure on this one.

701
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,241
Sir, I think I've got it.

702
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:19,912
When the limo stops
I get out on the left side.

703
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,604
- Right.
- Oh, the right side?

704
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:25,251
No, I mean, "correct." It's the left.

705
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:28,944
I walk around the back,
I open the right door to the limo...

706
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:33,422
...I help the ambassador out and
present him to Vice President Merck.

707
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,294
Correct.

708
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,097
She's late.

709
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,601
Well, here we are. Now...

710
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:49,533
...left.

711
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,570
Left side, left.
Yeah, this is the left.

712
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,141
Let's see, left.

713
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:01,144
<i>Have you lost control of her entirely?</i>

714
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:03,983
<i>We want her to be a princess,</i>
<i>not court jester.</i>

715
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,682
A few more days, only a few more days.

716
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,091
<i>God knows what she can do</i>
<i>in a few more days!</i>

717
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,878
"How do you do, Your Grace?"

718
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,183
"Thank you very much, baroness."

719
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:42,985
"I'm honored to meet you,
Your Excellency."

720
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,131
"Good night, knight."

721
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:46,856
"Good night, knight"?

722
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:49,395
Hello?

723
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,437
Yeah, hold on a minute.
Sunny, it's for you.

724
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,164
Oh, thanks.

725
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,105
Hello?

726
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:59,108
Hi, Mr. Crowe.

727
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:03,141
Yeah, the Queen of Dubai.

728
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:05,845
Okay.

729
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:09,147
I'll be there, don't you worry.

730
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:10,653
Bye.

731
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,589
You know more queens than I do.

732
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:15,925
Oh, Ben!

733
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:21,324
Yes, this is
the National Archives building.

734
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,801
You know, it holds
the Declaration of Independence...

735
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:29,169
...Constitution, Bill of Rights.

736
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,344
It's really pretty, isn't it?

737
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:34,806
Oh, I have the napkins
that match your hat.

738
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,243
Isn't that great?

739
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,113
Now, you know, I've never read
the Constitution.

740
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,515
This will be fun
for all of us, won't it?

741
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,523
And this is where we...

742
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:49,093
...encase all of our
precious documents.

743
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:51,363
And this is...

744
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:54,192
...the Constitution.

745
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:56,600
Very old.

746
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,334
And this is
the Declaration of Independence.

747
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,234
Can you read that?

748
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:09,044
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

749
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:12,844
...that all men are created equal...

750
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:16,614
...that they are endowed
by their Creator...

751
00:46:16,824 --> 00:46:20,521
...with certain inalienable rights...

752
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:23,855
...that among these
are life, liberty...

753
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:27,397
...and the pursuit of happiness.

754
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,466
That to secure these rights...

755
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,265
...governments are instituted
among men...

756
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:35,772
...deriving their just powers...

757
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:38,911
...from the consent of the governed."

758
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,241
Very interesting.

759
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,476
We're real proud of that.

760
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:01,927
What's the matter, you sick?

761
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:04,865
No, they closed the bookstore
to take inventory.

762
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,767
That looks good.
Can you make me one?

763
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:08,407
Here.

764
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:10,042
I thought you had a lunch.

765
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,178
I did, but it was for a Tibetan guy.

766
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,643
They served food
I didn't recognize.

767
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,782
The main course was still alive.

768
00:47:16,984 --> 00:47:17,973
Oh, Coke.

769
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:19,379
See anyone famous?

770
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,920
Well, I sat next to a senator who put
his hand on my leg under the table.

771
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:25,523
- Which one?
- The right one.

772
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:26,715
No, which senator?

773
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,122
I don't know.
You had to appreciate his energy.

774
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:32,355
He ate with one hand,
copped a feel with the other.

775
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:36,093
Talking about fiscal irresponsibility
all at the same time.

776
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:38,931
You know what amazes me,
is how these guys...

777
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,868
...have time to run the country...

778
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:44,942
...when they're so busy going
to banquets and openings all the time.

779
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:46,271
I don't know how they do it.

780
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,038
But are you having any fun?

781
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:51,081
Oh, yeah, fun, God,
I'm having a great time.

782
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,480
I mean, it's really very interesting.

783
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,850
I'm making a lot of mistakes,
but they don't seem to mind.

784
00:47:57,057 --> 00:47:59,491
- Wonder why that is?
- Maybe they just like you.

785
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:00,682
Yeah, maybe.

786
00:48:05,232 --> 00:48:08,065
Donna? Donna!

787
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:09,966
Hey, Donna!

788
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,798
Could you beep your horn, please?
Hey, Donna!

789
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:17,409
God, Sunny! Oh, Sunny.

790
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:21,573
Hi, sweetie!

791
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,644
Sunny, what are you doing?

792
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,546
A very special assignment.
Can't you tell?

793
00:48:27,754 --> 00:48:30,484
They look awfully like dogs.

794
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:34,752
Very important dogs, though. They
belong to some Bulgarian big shot.

795
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:35,951
Come on, guys, sit down.

796
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,152
Stay! Sheba!

797
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:40,222
Come on, stay.

798
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,163
Stay, baby, stay.

799
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,930
- Hi.
- Oh, Sunny.

800
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:48,571
God, we really miss you, Sunny.

801
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:51,437
- God, I miss you guys too.
- You do?

802
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:53,340
Everybody's so jealous of you.

803
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:56,846
All those big parties
and famous people...

804
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,611
...and events that shape our life,
and shit like that.

805
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:03,716
Oh, I gotta go. Darn it.

806
00:49:03,924 --> 00:49:05,448
Give my love to Lou, will you?

807
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:07,957
I think he's gonna
have to close the club.

808
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:09,953
Are you kidding?

809
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,894
He's losing money.
We're all out looking for other jobs.

810
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:15,762
Oh, that's terrible.

811
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,436
Is there anything I can do?

812
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:20,699
To tell you the truth,
I think Lou was hoping...

813
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:22,636
...with your new connections...

814
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:25,710
...you might be able to do
something to help him out.

815
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:28,346
Why don't you get in,
and we'll talk about it.

816
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,038
No, it's okay, I'm gonna walk.

817
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,239
Come on.

818
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:33,919
Sunny, I'm not really
crazy about dogs.

819
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:35,816
I know you're not crazy about dogs...

820
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,588
Wait a minute!

821
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,797
Wait! Sheba!

822
00:49:57,844 --> 00:49:59,368
Where is our dear Sunny?

823
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,568
In the bathroom.

824
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:03,579
I see. And Mr. Ransome?

825
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,752
In the bathroom.

826
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:13,754
- Better?
- Oh, yeah.

827
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,420
Now, what you should do is take
a very long, very hot shower.

828
00:50:18,632 --> 00:50:20,998
- When?
- Soon as possible.

829
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:22,293
Where?

830
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,528
- Hey, don't give me a hard time.
- Okay.

831
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:28,800
Listen, do you do necks?

832
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:39,118
Did you do this to your wife?

833
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:41,378
None of your business.

834
00:50:41,588 --> 00:50:43,579
God, you've got great fingers.

835
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:45,213
Not so loud.

836
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:46,687
Yikes.

837
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:48,554
I feel like I'm in high school.

838
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,595
- Did you lock the door?
- No.

839
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,533
Listen, will you tell me something?

840
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:56,862
What?

841
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,367
Why did they give me this job?

842
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:03,237
Because you did something
extraordinary.

843
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:04,774
And?

844
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,647
And they wanted to reward you.

845
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,910
And?

846
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:15,318
And it's good publicity for them.

847
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:18,782
Nothing else?

848
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:20,790
Like what?

849
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,024
I feel like...

850
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:27,929
...I don't know, like
they're testing me for something.

851
00:51:28,135 --> 00:51:31,764
If you behave yourself,
I'll give you a real massage someday.

852
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:34,497
Meanwhile, you ought to find
a good chiropractor.

853
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:38,075
And I think you just changed
the subject on me.

854
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:42,374
Sunny, I can't give you advice
about your life, I hardly know you.

855
00:51:42,582 --> 00:51:44,482
So get to know me.

856
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,212
Do you always say what you think?

857
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,252
It's no big deal.
I just never understood...

858
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:53,426
...why some people don't say
what they think.

859
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:55,788
Don't you say what you think?

860
00:51:57,297 --> 00:52:00,198
- Not always, no.
- Too bad.

861
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,400
You know what I read?
The Declaration of Independence.

862
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:08,574
The real one, the original.
The one in the Archives.

863
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:11,801
Boy, those guys knew how
to say what they thought.

864
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:15,038
Talk about simple.
All that stuff about happiness.

865
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:18,217
What government talks
about happiness anymore?

866
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:20,185
Sunny, are you in there?

867
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,376
Yes, ma'am.

868
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:24,056
We were concerned.

869
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:27,882
Well, Mr. Ransome was just
giving me an adjustment.

870
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,358
We're about to leave.

871
00:52:31,164 --> 00:52:34,998
And we were talking about the
Declaration of Independence.

872
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:40,338
You did lock it.

873
00:52:40,774 --> 00:52:41,763
What, dear?

874
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,307
I can't hear you, dear.
What did you say?

875
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:06,296
Are you coming, dear?

876
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:12,099
Sunny, dear, are you coming?

877
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:14,405
Not quite, ma'am.

878
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,356
He's here on an unofficial visit.

879
00:53:38,565 --> 00:53:39,998
Unofficial.

880
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,667
Officially.

881
00:53:41,868 --> 00:53:44,200
You mean officially
he's here unofficially.

882
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:45,894
Yes, that's exactly right.

883
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:50,736
It's not a state visit, not even
a ceremonial visit. It's private.

884
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,538
The emir wants privacy.

885
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:55,305
And now, Sunny...

886
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:58,579
...we want to take you
into our confidence.

887
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:02,653
And I know that we can trust you.
Am I right?

888
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:06,053
Mr. Hilley, my lips are sealed.

889
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:07,917
Good, because what I have to...

890
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:11,427
They could slap me around,
keep me awake for days at a time.

891
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:14,156
They could hang me upside down
and throw stuff.

892
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:15,356
Yes, yes, I see.

893
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:17,627
Keep me in a cell
without food or water.

894
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,826
You're a brave girl.

895
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:23,767
But they couldn't do electricity
or snakes because I don't think l...

896
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,667
Yes, sir?

897
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,178
We...

898
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:34,284
...our government...

899
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:36,751
...the United States of America...

900
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:41,223
...are attempting to negotiate
a complex...

901
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,625
...and highly important agreement...

902
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:47,527
...with the emir that will allow us...

903
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:51,526
...to build a military base
in his country.

904
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:57,037
- Right.
- The mission of your department...

905
00:54:57,844 --> 00:55:01,746
...is to see that the emir,
while he is in our country...

906
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,438
...has a good time.

907
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:08,413
Well, officially a good time
or unofficially?

908
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,248
Unofficially, of course.

909
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:12,554
Got it.

910
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:16,558
A very good time.

911
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:28,100
Come on, Lou, answer the phone.

912
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:32,210
Lou, it's Sunny.
Listen, I got a great idea.

913
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,141
Your Majesty.

914
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,778
Sunny.

915
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:50,015
Do you know what that is?

916
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,257
- That is your Supreme Court, right?
- Right.

917
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,859
Where laws are interpreted.

918
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,859
That's right.
You have that setup where you live?

919
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:02,057
Not exactly. Our laws
are handed down by Allah, by God.

920
00:57:02,268 --> 00:57:04,327
- To who?
- To me.

921
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,868
Oh.

922
00:57:15,615 --> 00:57:17,606
Hey, what's going on?

923
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:19,478
Supposedly a party for big shots.

924
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,917
I got a call from Protocol,
talked about a social event.

925
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:24,147
I got the same call.

926
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,018
Said something about lots of VIPs...

927
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:28,956
...and something
like "Guaranteed very good time."

928
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:31,062
Here in this dive?

929
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:34,863
Hey, didn't Sunny Davis used
to work in this joint?

930
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:37,868
- The Sheik of Arabic.
- Who the hell is that?

931
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,696
Thank you.

932
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:44,900
- Hey, isn't that Sunny Davis?
- Your Highness.

933
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:46,578
I'd like you to meet Lou Fox.

934
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:49,543
Hey, that's a hell of an honor,
Your Majesty.

935
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:51,808
That's all I got to say, an honor.

936
00:57:52,018 --> 00:57:53,246
Thank you very much.

937
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,512
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

938
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,755
- Here we go.
- Over here, Sunny, please.

939
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,392
You mind crouching down
a little, Your Honor...

940
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:03,357
...so we get the sign in the picture?

941
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,589
Here he comes! Girls, showtime!
Showtime, places!

942
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,293
George, you salute.

943
00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:13,097
Girls, flags over your heart.

944
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:19,737
I want you to think of this
as your oasis away from your oasis.

945
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:21,470
Your Majesty and you fellas...

946
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:25,447
...you'll find we pour some
of the most generous drinks in town.

947
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:27,347
- This way, Your Majesty.
- Okay.

948
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:31,183
Hey, by the way, tonight's dinner
special is Virginia ham...

949
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:32,983
...with a choice of vegetables.

950
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:35,457
- Hey, Lou?
- What, Sun, what?

951
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:37,129
Who are those guys?

952
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,900
It's a little birthday party.

953
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,162
They want me to make them
a cake made out of raw fish.

954
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:47,904
Well, happy birthday!

955
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,434
Happy birthday.

956
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:54,272
Oh, hi, honey!

957
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,345
What's going on in there?

958
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:57,538
What's this?

959
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:00,384
Hey, let's get this.

960
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,919
Hey, guys. Guys, get on this!

961
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,147
Ralph, get your camera.

962
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:08,561
Ladies, are you friends of Sunny's?

963
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:09,989
We're in public relations.

964
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:19,971
We're all out of camel's milk,
but this is yogurt and 7UP.

965
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,776
Gloria!

966
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:30,342
Oh, excuse me.

967
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,983
Place looks fabulous!

968
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,155
Hi, honey!
Oh, God, I'm so glad you could come.

969
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,849
Are you kidding?
What does "jackpot" mean to you?

970
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,994
You see that little guy over there?

971
00:59:43,696 --> 00:59:46,392
Go really easy on him
because he's a wise man.

972
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:48,362
You know, like a swami or a guru.

973
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:50,126
You know what I'm saying? Okay.

974
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,531
Hey, isn't that the Nawaf?

975
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,707
Nawaf!

976
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:57,835
Bobbie! Charmaine!

977
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:16,321
Yeah.

978
01:00:17,897 --> 01:00:19,091
What?

979
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:21,497
Where?

980
01:00:22,268 --> 01:00:23,496
What do you...?

981
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:25,234
Press?!

982
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,369
Make a wish.

983
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,417
- Hello.
- Hi.

984
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,349
This is a swell place, isn't it?

985
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,924
Yes, it is. Swell.

986
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:49,450
I used to work here.

987
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:50,959
I know that.

988
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:52,961
See that girl over there? There.

989
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,566
See that girl dressed
like kind of a chicken?

990
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,302
An emu, I would imagine.

991
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:00,062
What about her?

992
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:04,336
I used to have to wear that
costume a lot when I worked here.

993
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:06,705
It's pretty silly, isn't it?

994
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:09,114
You must have looked beautiful.

995
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:11,417
More males!

996
01:01:11,884 --> 01:01:12,873
Ben!

997
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:20,087
- Oh, thanks.
- Look at you.

998
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:21,817
Oh, thanks for coming.

999
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,791
I want you to come see the emir.

1000
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:26,226
- He's here!
- Just what we need, more men.

1001
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:31,062
Your Majesty, I'd like to introduce
you to Ben Granger and Jerry Jerome.

1002
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:33,430
These are the guys that I live with.

1003
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:37,370
And this is His...

1004
01:01:37,643 --> 01:01:40,976
...Highness.
- El Emir Khala’ad bin Abdul Majid.

1005
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:49,913
Just a short while ago, the emir and
his entourage escorted Sunny Davis...

1006
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,455
...inside the Safari Club
you see behind me.

1007
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:54,353
They came in those limos.

1008
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,495
By the way,
the guests continue to arrive.

1009
01:01:57,697 --> 01:02:01,133
The kind of guests you wouldn't
necessarily associate...

1010
01:02:12,545 --> 01:02:14,103
All right, Sue!

1011
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,008
Yeah, but I would.

1012
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:23,649
I think your guests
are having a good time.

1013
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,221
Oh, yes.

1014
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,496
- Hey.
- Jimmy?

1015
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:37,762
It's Jimmy!

1016
01:02:45,812 --> 01:02:47,905
Hey, great to see you, not tonight.

1017
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:50,082
I got a private party over there.

1018
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:51,910
Hey, Jimmy!

1019
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:55,351
- Hi, honey!
- Come on!

1020
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:57,716
Come on, I want you to meet somebody.

1021
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,682
Oh, banzai.

1022
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:04,056
Hi, how are you? Hi, guys!

1023
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:06,891
- Listen, have you ever met an emir?
- No.

1024
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,124
- Have you ever met a biker?
- No.

1025
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:12,395
Khala’ad, this is Jimmy,
Jimmy, this is Khala’ad.

1026
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:15,039
- How do you do?
- How you doing, man?

1027
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,833
Yes.

1028
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,340
What?

1029
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,943
I'm on my way.

1030
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,729
Hi.

1031
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:44,065
Was it difficult for you
to leave all this?

1032
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,261
This? Oh, no.

1033
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:48,497
I mean, I've made
a lot of good friends...

1034
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,232
...and we've had good times.

1035
01:03:50,443 --> 01:03:52,468
But, you know,
a person has to move on.

1036
01:03:52,678 --> 01:03:54,543
Sunny, you could be
the mother of kings.

1037
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:59,275
Oh, sure, Queen Sunny,
the ex-cocktail waitress.

1038
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:03,052
I'm just lucky I get to meet
people like you.

1039
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,746
Just because of that accident.

1040
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:06,857
- There are no accidents.
- Oh, sure.

1041
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:09,459
There is only destiny and character.

1042
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:12,790
Destiny brought you together
with me and a man with a gun.

1043
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:16,093
Your character
brought you the rest of the way.

1044
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:18,429
- No, I don't think so.
- Sunny, you and I...

1045
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:21,129
...are more than
an ex-waitress and emir.

1046
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,739
We're also a man and a woman.

1047
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,239
Yeah, I can see that.

1048
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,502
You understand what I'm saying?

1049
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,107
Yeah, you want to date me.

1050
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,442
Emirs do not date.

1051
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,454
Mr. Hilley, Mr. Hilley!

1052
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:42,492
Mr. Hassler, what is the White House...?

1053
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:45,663
- Is there a party going on?
- Not now.

1054
01:04:52,204 --> 01:04:54,104
- Hey.
- What can I get for you?

1055
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,275
I like that coat.

1056
01:04:56,676 --> 01:04:57,665
He likes my coat!

1057
01:04:57,877 --> 01:04:59,708
- Give it to him.
- All right!

1058
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:04,380
You got it, now give me your coat.

1059
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:08,384
Okay, now remember, it's B-Y-O-L,
bring your own leather.

1060
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:21,162
- "Beat me, whip me..."
- What do you think of that?

1061
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:24,359
You like that? You got it!

1062
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:27,539
What about Sunny Davis, Mr. Hassler?

1063
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,537
Why is Mr. Ransome here?

1064
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:31,369
I want an explanation.

1065
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:32,942
- I'm sure it's okay.
- Right.

1066
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:34,339
What are they doing in there?

1067
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:36,708
- Having a good time, I guess.
- What?

1068
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:39,384
- Having a good time?!
- Yes.

1069
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,067
Jesus Christ!

1070
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,104
What the hell is this place?

1071
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:38,242
Must be one of those
gay-Arab-biker sushi bars.

1072
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:49,112
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

1073
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:53,885
Party!

1074
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:07,162
Sunny.

1075
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:11,241
What in God's name are you doing
in this tide of human swill?

1076
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:13,133
Why, you...

1077
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,683
- Wait, wait, what's swill?
- You're under arrest.

1078
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,476
Listen, listen, hey!

1079
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:22,841
I know we can work this out
just the way the diplomats do.

1080
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:33,219
<i>WXED Action Line.</i>

1081
01:08:33,425 --> 01:08:37,088
<i>Tonight's WXED hot story.</i>

1082
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:39,526
<i>Tonight's hot story is</i>
<i>hotter than usual.</i>

1083
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:42,860
<i>Dozens of dignitaries have been</i>

1084

1087
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:56,080

1090
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,531
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1091
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,933
- Michael, take them.
- Yes, of course.

1092
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,406
Sunny, Sunny Davis.

1093
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:30,247
Sunny, thank you, it was
an unforgettable evening.

1094
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:35,245
<i>- We won't keep you much longer, dear.</i>
<i>- I'm really sorry.</i>

1095
01:09:35,454 --> 01:09:39,049
You'll have my resignation after
I look up how they're written.

1096
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:43,024
We have no intention of asking
for your resignation.

1097
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:45,129
- You don't?
- Certainly not.

1098
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:49,358
There will be tactical problems
in dealing with tonight's situation.

1099
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:51,433
Let's go into my office.

1100
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:54,735
Well, I think I'll write
a letter to the emir.

1101
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,998
Listen to me.

1102
01:09:56,909 --> 01:10:00,936
We will take care of this matter.
You will not be a part of it.

1103
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:02,807
I won't?

1104
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:07,645
In a few hours,
the emir will fly back to his country.

1105
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,580
- We want you to go with him.
- You're kidding!

1106
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:16,693
You are right now our principal
social contact with the emir.

1107
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:19,956
Our relations with him up until
now have been ambivalent.

1108
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,267
You can change that.

1109
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:26,836
Gee, I don't know,
I've never been outside the U.S.

1110
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:28,802
- Do you really think l...?
- Sunny...

1111
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:34,105
...this is a chance for you to perform
a vital service for your country.

1112
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:38,181
Does this have anything to do
with that strategic military thing...

1113
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:43,048
...Mr. Hilley talked about yesterday?
- Absolutely not.

1114
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:47,988
This has to do with simple trust.
Trust between us.

1115
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,886
Trust between you and the emir.

1116
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:53,956
<i>You'll be treated like royalty.</i>

1117
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,656
<i>You'll stay in a lovely palace.</i>

1118
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:59,599
<i>It will be like living</i>
<i>in a beautiful dream.</i>

1119
01:10:59,805 --> 01:11:03,206
<i>Beautiful, beautiful dream.</i>

1120
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:29,657
Thank you.

1121
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:34,863
<i>Dear Michael, I don't know when</i>
<i>I'll be able to send this letter...</i>

1122
01:11:35,074 --> 01:11:38,601
<i>... I wanted you to know how grateful</i>
<i>I am for helping me out.</i>

1123
01:11:39,778 --> 01:11:43,043
<i>I know you're going to be proud</i>
<i>of the job I'm doing.</i>

1124
01:11:43,248 --> 01:11:45,148
<i>The people here are friendly...</i>

1125
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:48,184
<i>... and they greeted me like</i>
<i>I'm a real princess.</i>

1126
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,652
<i>I can honestly say I'm on</i>
<i>a sort of intimate footing...</i>

1127
01:11:51,857 --> 01:11:53,688
<i>... with some of them already...</i>

1128
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:57,555
<i>... although I can't understand what</i>
<i>any of them are talking about.</i>

1129
01:11:57,763 --> 01:12:00,129
<i>I haven't been outside</i>
<i>the palace yet...</i>

1130
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:03,062
<i>... but as soon as possible,</i>
<i>I plan to contact...</i>

1131
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:06,795
<i>... the American ambassador</i>
<i>for any special instructions.</i>

1132
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:08,633
<i>I think there's a feast tonight...</i>

1133
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:12,902
<i>... and tomorrow we're supposed</i>
<i>to go on a camel ride in the desert.</i>

1134
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:15,609
<i>If there's a diplomatic pouch</i>
<i>coming here...</i>

1135
01:12:15,814 --> 01:12:19,272
<i>... I wouldn't mind if you</i>
<i>included a tuna salad sandwich...</i>

1136
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:22,249
<i>... and some lip gloss.</i>

1137
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:25,853
A poem for Sunny.

1138
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,924
"Ah, Sunny!

1139
01:12:30,129 --> 01:12:34,225
Golden hair like the desert sun

1140
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,732
Eyes the color of the summer sky

1141
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,633
Breasts riper than
The ripest pomegranates

1142
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,107
And loins like the royal storehouse
Bursting with the seed of kings.

1143
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:49,803
Loins that boil..."

1144
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,781
<i>I'm happy to announce</i>
<i>that a high-ranking delegation...</i>

1145
01:12:56,989 --> 01:13:00,425
<i>... will travel to Ohtar to sign</i>
<i>an agreement with the emir...</i>

1146
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,923
<i>... for a military base.</i>

1147
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:04,186
<i>Hi, we're back with</i> TV Truth.

1148
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:07,456
<i>Wendy, would you analyze</i>
<i>the tape for our audience?</i>

1149
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:10,601
<i>Hassler starts by announcing</i>
<i>that they cut the deal.</i>

1150
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,861
<i>So we got our base.</i>

1151
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:14,164
<i>Yes, but I want your audience</i>
<i>to see this.</i>

1152
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:16,864
<i>He's announcing that</i>
<i>a contingent of...</i>

1153
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:19,010
<i>That's not so unusual. Here it is.</i>

1154
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:21,338
<i>We'll get them to stay</i>
<i>for the wedding.</i>

1155
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:23,515
<i>- Was that a slip?</i>
<i>- That is some slip.</i>

1156
01:13:23,715 --> 01:13:25,273
<i>He had no intention</i>
<i>of mentioning that.</i>

1157
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,782
<i>No, he didn't. He's such a jerk.</i>

1158
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,112
<i>What wedding?</i>

1159
01:13:31,757 --> 01:13:35,488
<i>Dear Mrs. St. John: They keep me</i>
<i>busy here, and I'm experiencing...</i>

1160
01:13:35,694 --> 01:13:37,821
<i>... all sorts of</i>
<i>new, exotic fragrances.</i>

1161
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,522
<i>Tomorrow, I hope to see how</i>
<i>the ordinary people live.</i>

1162
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:46,329
<i>Please give my best to Mr. Crowe.</i>
<i>Sincerely, Sunny Davis.</i>

1163
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:38,015
Cover your hair!

1164
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,060
<i>She's marrying the emir.</i>

1165
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,560
<i>He's in everything, on TV...</i>

1166
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:51,702
<i>... and in</i> People,
<i>and he's so cute, and...</i>

1167
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,464
<i>God, I wish I was her.</i>

1168
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:57,437
<i>She's embarrassed the country,</i>
<i>are you kidding?</i>

1169
01:14:57,643 --> 01:14:59,838
<i>Embarrassed the country,</i>
<i>marrying that guy.</i>

1170
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:02,479
<i>It's just a thing</i>
<i>for the money, right?</i>

1171
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:05,241
<i>I think Sunny Davis</i>
<i>represents the kind of...</i>

1172
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,543
<i>... American woman</i>
<i>we can all be proud of.</i>

1173
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,745
<i>She's real, she's honest...</i>

1174
01:15:10,956 --> 01:15:13,049
<i>... and she isn't taking</i>
<i>crap from anybody.</i>

1175
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:14,791
Okay, gentlemen.

1176
01:15:14,993 --> 01:15:18,622
Here's a list I've made up
of some places I'd like to visit.

1177
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:22,197
One of them is a hospital,
a daycare center...

1178
01:15:22,401 --> 01:15:28,101
...maybe a farm, an irrigation
project, something like that.

1179
01:15:28,307 --> 01:15:31,743
And also, I'd like to see...

1180
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:36,506
...that military base we're building.
Where is it?

1181
01:15:58,503 --> 01:16:00,130
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1182
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,950
I've been set up, haven't I?

1183
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:29,033
Shall we go back?

1184
01:16:56,728 --> 01:16:57,820
I want to talk to you!

1185
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,520
Why are you dressed like that?

1186
01:16:59,731 --> 01:17:02,427
Because I'm an American, that's why.

1187
01:17:12,577 --> 01:17:15,512
What were you gonna do,
make me part of your harem?

1188
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:18,205
I don't have a harem,
I have some wives.

1189
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:21,580
Wives? You got "some" wives?

1190
01:17:22,954 --> 01:17:24,512
Help me!

1191
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:31,357
Some wives? You must have
billboards all over town.

1192
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:32,552
Quickly, this way.

1193
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:35,130
They've not been able to give me sons.

1194
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:36,426
I must have sons.

1195
01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:38,569
This is the 20th century!

1196
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,931
Don't you know anything
about chromosomes?

1197
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:43,505
When my country finds out
what you tried to do...

1198
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,733
When they find out?

1199
01:17:44,943 --> 01:17:46,342
Get down!

1200
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,574
Why do you think you were sent here?

1201
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:54,513
I don't believe you.
Americans don't do things like that.

1202
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,280
Do we?

1203
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:08,629
Hurry, that way!

1204
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:13,204
- Are you all right?
- Move.

1205
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:17,936
You know how to fly one of these?

1206
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:20,008
I'm the chief of the air force.

1207
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:22,339
That's not what I asked.

1208
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,658
<i>Revolution in Ohtar sparked</i>
<i>by the imminent wedding...</i>

1209

1215
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,043
<i>... Sunny Davis had no knowledge</i>

<i>Tonight's inside story:</i>

1221
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:16,032
<i>Sunny Davis, heroine or hustler?</i>

1222
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:20,027
<i>She was queen for a day,</i>
<i>and she claims she didn't know it.</i>

1223
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:23,935
<i>Her presence started a war</i>
<i>that may affect the world's economy.</i>

1224
01:19:24,142 --> 01:19:26,770
<i>Rescued from sure death</i>
<i>and probable torture...</i>

1225
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:31,074
<i>... she learned she was traded for the</i>
<i>balance of power in the Middle East.</i>

1226
01:19:32,484 --> 01:19:34,349
<i>Or did she know it?</i>

1227
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,350
<i>Absolutely not. We goofed.</i>
<i>She didn't know a thing.</i>

1228
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,186
<i>We traded her for the base.</i>

1229
01:19:42,394 --> 01:19:44,794
<i>We duped her,</i>
<i>now we ought to pay for it.</i>

1230
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:47,464
<i>Where is Ohtar?</i>
<i>And why should we care?</i>

1231
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:50,999
<i>This emirate might pull down</i>
<i>an American administration...</i>

1232
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:56,004
<i>... and send it into a scandal</i>
<i>that could only be called "Sunnygate."</i>

1233
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,668
<i>Sex, politics. Politics, sex.</i>
<i>Sunnygate.</i>

1234
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,074
<i>Did she, or didn't she?</i>

1235
01:20:03,281 --> 01:20:07,843
<i>And if she did, did she do it</i>
<i>for her country? Stay tuned.</i>

1236
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,782
- Senator Norris.
- Senator Norris!

1237
01:20:09,988 --> 01:20:13,287
Was Sunny traded for a military base?
People want the facts.

1238
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:16,518
Yeah, I know, I got about
30,000 telegrams and letters...

1239
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,889
...phone calls, all asking
the same question.

1240
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:20,962
The answer is, we just don't know.

1241
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:25,728
I'll tell you, it's gonna be one hell
of an investigation, I promise.

1242
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:29,930
<i>Public pressure on the administration</i>
<i>continues in the Sunnygate affair.</i>

1243
01:20:30,141 --> 01:20:31,870
<i>Senator Norris announced hearings...</i>

1244
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,204
<i>... to discover the truth</i>
<i>in the allegations...</i>

1245
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:35,436
Yes, sir.

1246
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:40,409
Yes, sir, we're watching it now.

1247
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:42,587
<i>What did she know about</i>
<i>the connection...</i>

1248
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:45,278
<i>... between that base</i>
<i>and her engagement?</i>

1249
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:48,584
<i>And when did she know about it?</i>
<i>Marla Gilbert, WFDD.</i>

1250
01:20:48,894 --> 01:20:49,883
You lied to me.

1251
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,689
What we did was
for the good of the country.

1252
01:20:52,898 --> 01:20:53,887
You lied to me.

1253
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,761
What she's saying is that
certain decisions...

1254
01:20:56,968 --> 01:20:59,937
...on sensitive issues
have to be made discreetly.

1255
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:02,129
After all, the welfare of the people...

1256
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,740
Wait a minute,
I'm one of the people, aren't I?

1257
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,275
The important thing
is that we pull together...

1258
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:09,504
...so when that committee
starts the hearing...

1259
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:12,615
You want to tell me what you
think I should say, right?

1260
01:21:12,817 --> 01:21:14,717
Only if you're comfortable with that.

1261
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,820
Well, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

1262
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:20,458
Tell you this.
I can't wait to find out.

1263
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:23,150
Sunny, we're all in this together.

1264
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:26,455
We, you and I, represent
the president, and I'm sure...

1265
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:31,830
You're a very misguided person,
and I don't work for you any longer.

1266
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:35,268
- Sunny?
- Going back to waiting on tables?

1267
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,963
Goodbye, Mrs. St. John.

1268
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:39,609
- All right, Sunny, look.
- Let me go, Mr. Hilley.

1269
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:44,805
I'm going to make one last appeal
to you on behalf of the country.

1270
01:21:45,817 --> 01:21:48,081
There are at least
four people in here...

1271
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:52,882
...who don't speak for my country.
And you're one of them.

1272
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:31,692
- Over here, Sunny.
- Sunny.

1273
01:22:31,896 --> 01:22:34,831
Were you only a pawn
in the Ohtar situation?

1274
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,366
How did the Protocol Department
manipulate you?

1275
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,332
What? Oh.

1276
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,530
Excuse me, Miss Davis...

1277
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:47,143
...you may remember me from
Turner News Network...

1278
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:50,610
Miss Davis, how are you going
to defend yourself?

1279
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:52,908
If there's something you'd like to...?

1280
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:58,479
- Can you give us a statement?
- Has the president given instruction?

1281
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:01,523
We have no comment at this time.

1282
01:23:02,994 --> 01:23:04,222
There's Michael Ransome.

1283
01:23:04,429 --> 01:23:08,024
Mr. Ransome, do you expect
to testify for the department?

1284
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,396
Mr. Ransome is no longer
with the department.

1285
01:23:11,603 --> 01:23:12,934
Have you been fired?

1286
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:14,230
No, sir, I resigned.

1287
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:17,033
- Was it over the Sunnygate affair?
- Yes.

1288
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,766
What else happened...?

1289
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:24,112
Just a minute. Look, I'm an
expert on Middle Eastern affairs.

1290
01:23:24,315 --> 01:23:27,011
I was on my way up
in the political racket...

1291
01:23:27,218 --> 01:23:28,617
...if you know what I mean.

1292
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:32,779
And then a few weeks ago
I met this...

1293
01:23:32,991 --> 01:23:35,050
...extraordinary
person who reminded me...

1294
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:39,026
...that I had forgotten something
real basic, real simple.

1295
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:42,625
That I have forgotten
to say what I think.

1296
01:23:45,303 --> 01:23:47,294
So I quit, that's all.

1297
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,973
Sunny, is there anything
you'd like to say?

1298
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,206
Yes, he owes me a massage.

1299
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:06,418
Do you swear to tell the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth...

1300
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:08,558
...so help you God?
- I do.

1301
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,728
State your name
for the record, please.

1302
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:13,955
- Sunny Ann Davis.
- And what is your present address?

1303
01:24:14,165 --> 01:24:15,928
1442 "G" Street.

1304
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:18,800
And what is your age, please?

1305
01:24:20,205 --> 01:24:21,604
Thirty-five.

1306
01:24:22,407 --> 01:24:23,396
Senator Norris?

1307
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:25,075
Sunny...

1308
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,735
...when did you first meet the emir?

1309
01:24:27,946 --> 01:24:31,177
The night I got shot...
No, I'm sorry...

1310
01:24:31,382 --> 01:24:34,613
...I didn't meet him then,
it was after they gave me...

1311
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:37,583
...the job at Protocol
and the emir came back.

1312
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:42,317
- I see, and the emir came back for...?
- For me.

1313
01:24:44,562 --> 01:24:48,464
No, I meant for how long
a period of time?

1314
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,829
Oh, it was just a couple of days.
It was unofficial.

1315
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:56,166
- An unofficial visit?
- Officially, yes.

1316
01:24:56,374 --> 01:25:00,208
And what, to the best
of your understanding...

1317
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:02,811
...were your duties
with regard to the emir?

1318
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:05,209
I was supposed
to show him a good time.

1319
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:11,314
A good time?

1320
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,616
Yes, sir, that's what
Mr. Hilley told me.

1321
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:18,688
Mr. Hilley told you to show
the emir a good time?

1322
01:25:18,897 --> 01:25:22,890
Well, actually, the exact words
he used were "a very good time."

1323
01:25:27,305 --> 01:25:32,072
And how did you interpret
this curious directive?

1324
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:34,837
Oh, I didn't interpret it,
I just did it.

1325
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:37,640
I took the emir
and his friends to a party...

1326
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:40,682
...at Lou Fox's Safari Club
where I used to work.

1327
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:45,151
I have to say that I really
feel badly about what happened.

1328
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:48,519
I imagine it was the first time
Mrs. St. John got busted.

1329
01:25:51,663 --> 01:25:53,062
Of course, I could be wrong.

1330
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:59,567
Sunny, I'd like to move on
to your trip abroad with the emir.

1331
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:00,760
Yes, sir.

1332
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:04,499
Didn't you think it was unusual
for a person like yourself...

1333
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:09,408
...who had no expertise, to be
sent on a mission of such importance?

1334
01:26:09,614 --> 01:26:12,549
Yes, but I figured
they must know what they're doing...

1335
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,583
...because they're supposed
to be the experts.

1336
01:26:15,787 --> 01:26:19,746
Sunny, the purpose of this hearing
is to find out who is responsible.

1337
01:26:20,491 --> 01:26:21,788
If you give us the name...

1338
01:26:21,993 --> 01:26:23,255
No, sir, l...

1339
01:26:23,461 --> 01:26:25,452
No, sir, I'm sorry, I can't do that.

1340
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:28,856
You can't? Why not?

1341
01:26:30,335 --> 01:26:32,803
Because I'm responsible.

1342
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:38,802
You know what my dad says?
"Let a guy sell you a diamond ring...

1343
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:42,912
...for only 10 cents, and chances
are you own a ring not worth a dime."

1344
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:45,979
Well, I bought the whole mine.

1345
01:26:46,517 --> 01:26:50,009
I thought I was getting a free ride
or at least a cheap one.

1346
01:26:50,221 --> 01:26:52,451
And I really have to
thank them for that.

1347
01:26:52,657 --> 01:26:55,922
I mean, the people who sold it
to me, I mean.

1348
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,685
You want to know something?

1349
01:26:57,896 --> 01:27:00,831
Before I started to work
for the government...

1350
01:27:01,032 --> 01:27:03,500
...I'd never read the Constitution.

1351
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:07,034
I didn't even begin to know
how things worked. I didn't.

1352
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:11,698
I didn't read the newspaper,
except to look up my horoscope.

1353
01:27:12,577 --> 01:27:16,240
And I never read
the Declaration of Independence.

1354
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:19,177
But I know they had,
the ones we're talking about...

1355
01:27:19,384 --> 01:27:23,445
...the experts, they all read it.
They just forgot what it was about.

1356
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:27,955
That it's about "we the people."
And that's me.

1357
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:33,187
I'm "we the people."
You're "we the people." All of us.

1358
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:35,366
We're all "we the people," right?

1359
01:27:36,134 --> 01:27:40,002
So when they sell me that 10-cent
diamond, or down the river, or...

1360
01:27:40,204 --> 01:27:43,264
...to some guy wearing medals
that means they're selling us.

1361
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:45,601
All of "we the people."

1362
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:47,333
And when they...

1363
01:27:47,545 --> 01:27:51,982
I mean, when you guys, when you spend
another pile of money...

1364
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:56,210
...and give away or sell all
those guns and tanks and planes...

1365
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,584
Every time you invite a foreign
big shot to the White House...

1366
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,656
...and hug them,
and give them gifts...

1367
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,556
...it has a direct effect on
"we the people's" lives.

1368
01:28:05,763 --> 01:28:08,459
I mean, if I don't know
what you're up to...

1369
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:12,193
...and if I don't holler when I think
you're doing it wrong...

1370
01:28:12,403 --> 01:28:16,499
...and if I just mind my own business
and don't vote or care...

1371
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,869
...then I just get what I deserve.

1372
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:24,046
So now that I'm Sunny Davis,
private citizen again...

1373
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:27,340
...you're gonna have to
watch out for me...

1374
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:32,546
...because I'm gonna be watching
all of you like a hawk.

1375
01:28:38,696 --> 01:28:40,561
We love you, Sunny!

1376
01:28:46,204 --> 01:28:47,432
Calm down!

1377
01:28:48,272 --> 01:28:51,298
I'm sure that the good sense
of the American people...

1378
01:28:51,509 --> 01:28:56,344
...will allow them to distinguish
between a few trivial allegations...

1379
01:28:56,547 --> 01:28:59,380
- There she is, there's Sunny!
- Sunny!

1380
01:29:05,823 --> 01:29:07,552
Get off of me, you twit!

1381
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:12,222
- How did I do?
- Great.

1382
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,295
- Do you really think so?
- Of course.

1383
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:17,027
It's the new me, I say what I think.

1384
01:29:17,235 --> 01:29:20,102
Oh, that's nice, Michael,
that's really nice.

1385
01:29:20,304 --> 01:29:21,737
- Want to know what else?
- What?

1386
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:24,305
If you run for office,
I'll manage your campaign.

1387
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:26,067
Are you kidding?

1388
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:28,973
- Are you running?
- How about running for president?

1389
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,114
- Sunny Davis for president!
- Yeah!

1390
01:29:33,351 --> 01:29:36,878
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1391
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:38,851
Please, everybody.

1392
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:42,993
Thank you very much,
but it's really not my style.

1393
01:29:44,062 --> 01:29:47,725
- Sunny, what about Congress?
- What about running for Congress?

<i>The polls have been closed for</i>

<i>I just want to say</i>
<i>a couple of things.</i>

1404
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:34,244
<i>First, this is not a victory speech,</i>
<i>because we haven't won yet.</i>
