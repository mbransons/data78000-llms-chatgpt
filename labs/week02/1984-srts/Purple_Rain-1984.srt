I'm a good singer and dancer.[br]Maybe he could use me.

(Bongo drumbeat, background)

00:11:02.69,00:11:04.41
FATHER: (Yells) Listen to me!

00:11:04.49,00:11:08.45
You come home when I say come home.[br]You got no business in the streets.

00:11:08.81,00:11:10.16
MOTHER: Leave me alone.

00:11:10.25,00:11:11.65
FATHER: Come here!

00:11:11.97,00:11:13.32
I said, "Now!"

00:11:13.89,00:11:15.96
FATHER: Do you hear me?[br]THE KID: Mom! Dad!

00:11:16.05,00:11:17.69
FATHER: Keep this place clean!

00:11:17.77,00:11:19.68
THE KID: Please, Dad, she's heard you!

00:11:19.77,00:11:21.28
MOTHER: He wants to kill me.

00:11:21.37,00:11:22.28
He's crazy.

00:11:22.37,00:11:24.48
MOTHER: Look what he's doing to me.

00:11:37.21,00:11:38.61
BILLY: I don't get it.

00:11:38.69,00:11:41.36
An important meeting like this[br]and he doesn't show up.

00:11:41.45,00:11:43.88
The Kid must've forgotten[br]who owns this club.

00:11:43.97,00:11:46.36
I got to make some changes. Fast.

00:11:46.45,00:11:48.36
It's going to affect all the bands.

00:11:48.45,00:11:51.56
It's the second time he's missed.[br]I'm telling you he's fucking up.

00:11:51.65,00:11:54.45
You know what you need to do?[br]You need to get rid of him.

00:11:54.53,00:11:58.28
The last three bands that came out[br]here went on to be big stars.

00:11:58.37,00:12:02.92
I thought The Kid was next, but he's[br]ruined it. He ain't even pulling them in.

00:12:03.33,00:12:06.44
He just plays a lot of shit[br]that nobody wants to hear.

00:12:06.53,00:12:08.44
Like his old man, Francis L.

00:12:08.73,00:12:10.56
Did he ever mess his career up!

00:12:10.65,00:12:12.21
Ruined his wife's, too.

00:12:12.29,00:12:14.40
Now The Kid's doing the same shit.

00:12:15.29,00:12:19.49
I hear he's having a problem with[br]his band...especially Lisa and Wendy.

00:12:19.89,00:12:24.04
They won't be together for long.[br]I'm telling you, you need to get rid of him.

00:12:24.29,00:12:28.68
I need to get somebody commercial.[br]Something that will work every night.

00:12:29.93,00:12:31.68
Like a girls' group?

00:12:32.33,00:12:34.76
Yeah, a girls' group. Yeah, Morris.

00:12:35.09,00:12:38.44
Something sexy, but not dirty.[br]I got enough problems.

00:12:39.33,00:12:42.44
I'll lay it on you straight.[br]I put together something hot...

00:12:42.53,00:12:44.60
...and The Kid is out, right?

00:12:46.53,00:12:49.33
THE KID: It's kind of dead in here.[br]Where is everybody?

00:12:49.41,00:12:52.88
JILL: I don't know. Billy and Morris[br]were sure looking for you.

00:12:53.69,00:12:54.96
That's nice.

00:12:56.13,00:12:58.40
Maybe I'll come back at a better time.

00:12:58.49,00:13:00.48
Think tonight this place'll be jumping?

00:13:00.57,00:13:02.00
Well, I'll be here.

00:13:04.13,00:13:05.24
JILL: Wait!

00:13:05.57,00:13:07.32
I've got something for you.

00:13:07.85,00:13:09.25
What? A subpoena?

00:13:09.41,00:13:11.24
A song Lisa and Wendy wrote.

00:13:11.97,00:13:14.36
Why didn't they give it to me themselves?

00:13:14.53,00:13:16.64
I liked it and wanted to listen to it.

00:13:16.73,00:13:19.69
JILL: They told me to give it to you[br]when I was done.

00:13:23.69,00:13:25.25
You really liked it?

00:13:32.05,00:13:34.00
(Instrumental rock beat)

00:13:58.45,00:14:00.09
Three and four, five...

00:14:00.29,00:14:01.80
Oh, Lord! Cut!

00:14:02.37,00:14:04.20
(Microphone screeches)

00:14:06.05,00:14:09.64
You ladies don't seem to realize[br]how valuable my time is.

00:14:10.53,00:14:12.80
You're going to make my boys look bad.

00:14:13.25,00:14:15.68
BRENDA: Let us come up[br]with our own steps.

00:14:16.29,00:14:18.04
We tried that. Remember?

00:14:18.89,00:14:22.16
MORRIS: You're in the best possible[br]position you could be in.

00:14:22.25,00:14:25.24
So, what's the matter?[br]Your shoes on too tight?

00:14:25.89,00:14:27.53
Let's have some action!

00:14:27.65,00:14:29.64
MORRIS: Let's have some asses wiggling.

00:14:29.73,00:14:31.64
I want some perfection.

00:14:31.73,00:14:32.92
(Morris hoots)

00:14:33.01,00:14:35.44
(Instrumental rock beat continues)

00:14:39.33,00:14:41.36
I think I'm going to need a drink.

00:14:41.65,00:14:44.53
MORRIS: This ain't happening.[br]The bitches are okay, but...

00:14:44.61,00:14:46.28
...we need something more exciting.

00:14:46.37,00:14:48.84
We should be doing better.[br]Any ideas?

00:14:48.93,00:14:51.16
That Apollonia babe we saw last night.

00:14:51.45,00:14:53.36
Why don't we find out where she lives?

00:14:53.45,00:14:56.48
I already got that.[br]Jill gave me everything last night.

00:14:56.57,00:14:58.08
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

00:14:58.17,00:15:01.40
No, I want her to come to me.[br]I'm the only star in town.

00:15:01.49,00:15:03.56
SUE: Morris, who do you think you are?

00:15:03.65,00:15:05.29
I waited up all night for you!

00:15:05.37,00:15:07.28
I'm tired of you doing this to me!

00:15:07.37,00:15:09.36

00:15:24.77,00:15:26.20
Such nastiness.

00:15:39.33,00:15:40.97
That. On your boot.

00:15:47.97,00:15:49.24
Hey, wait!

00:15:50.37,00:15:51.72
Give it back to me!

00:15:51.81,00:15:52.84
You can have it later.

00:15:52.93,00:15:54.33
I want it back now.

00:15:54.41,00:15:55.36
Who gave it to you?

00:15:55.45,00:15:56.36
A person.

00:15:56.45,00:15:57.96
-Male or female?[br]-Huh?

00:15:59.21,00:16:02.40
You're lying. I can tell just[br]by your reaction, you're lying.

00:16:02.49,00:16:04.05
THE KID: So, you gave it to me.

00:16:04.13,00:16:05.72
It's not yours anymore.

00:16:07.81,00:16:10.72
(SIow, melancholic rock music continues,[br]background)

THE KID: What are you doing here?

00:18:37.73,00:18:41.20
APOLLONIA: I heard about the club[br]and I thought I'd try my luck.

APOLLONIA: I'm a singer.

00:18:51.17,00:18:53.08
First Avenue is really famous.

APOLLONIA: A lot of bands make it[br]after playing there.

00:18:55.97,00:18:57.72
It must be really exciting.

00:18:58.53,00:19:00.25
Is that what turns you on?

00:19:00.33,00:19:01.65
What do you mean?

00:19:01.73,00:19:03.00
Making it.

00:19:03.97,00:19:06.00
It'd be nice for a change.

00:19:08.77,00:19:10.52
It's all I dream about.

No.

No.

00:19:33.41,00:19:34.40
No.

00:19:35.49,00:19:37.88
'Cause you wouldn't pass the initiation.

00:19:38.37,00:19:39.64
What initiation?

00:19:42.05,00:19:43.12
For starters...

00:19:43.21,00:19:46.68
...you have to purify yourself[br]in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.

00:19:47.05,00:19:47.92

That ain't Lake Minnetonka.

No, you looked great.

Cool. I come get you,[br]let you know the girl's there.

Hi.

00:25:10.29,00:25:14.28
I heard through the grapevine[br]that you had a new tune written by...

00:25:14.77,00:25:16.52
...a couple of great girls.

00:25:16.81,00:25:18.13
Did you hear it?

00:25:20.45,00:25:22.92
I knew it. He didn't listen to it.

00:25:23.97,00:25:27.44
LISA: He probably dropped it[br]under his bike and rolled over it.

00:25:30.65,00:25:31.97
Wow. All right.

00:25:33.49,00:25:34.92
You think about this.

00:25:35.01,00:25:36.76
WENDY: I'll be honest with you.

00:25:36.85,00:25:38.76
I think you're being full of shit.

Shut up, Lisa! Please.

You should know by now[br]that we wouldn't hurt you.

00:29:21.73,00:29:23.00
You think so?

00:29:23.09,00:29:24.16
Yes.

00:29:28.29,00:29:30.04
Who's paying for this?

00:29:30.37,00:29:32.12
MORRIS: I think you know that.

00:29:32.21,00:29:33.24

00:29:58.69,00:30:00.12
Get my change.

JEROME: (Whispers) Of course. Anything.

00:30:09.81,00:30:12.24
(Morris slurps, Apollonia giggles)

00:30:13.73,00:30:17.56
Would you require anything else[br]besides my company to make you happy?

00:30:20.29,00:30:22.40
Either there's something in my drink...

00:30:22.49,00:30:25.21
...or you're the finest woman[br]I've seen in ages.

00:30:25.57,00:30:26.92
What did you say?

00:30:27.09,00:30:28.65
You look nice tonight.

00:30:30.69,00:30:32.88
I wish you could see my home.

00:30:33.73,00:30:35.21
It's so exciting.

00:30:36.61,00:30:38.20
In my bedroom...

It's rare that I put my cards[br]on the table with young ladies, but...

00:31:02.69,00:31:05.08

No, we can't.

00:37:18.81,00:37:20.45
Why, is somebody there?

00:37:20.73,00:37:23.32
Why do you always think[br]there's somebody else?

APOLLONIA: So what did you do to her?

00:39:46.33,00:39:48.72
Do you always treat your women like that?

00:39:49.37,00:39:51.44

Can't you just leave it alone?

00:44:11.77,00:44:13.17
Yeah? What?

00:44:15.29,00:44:19.04
A little song and dance.[br]That is, if you can sing and dance.

That's not true.

00:44:33.05,00:44:35.56

Just come by. Maybe we can[br]work something out.

00:44:57.21,00:44:58.64
