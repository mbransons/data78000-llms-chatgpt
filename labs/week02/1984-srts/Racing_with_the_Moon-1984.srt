1
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,965
Hurry, the train.

2
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:18,467
Henry, stop this.
I'm sorry, Mr. Arthur.

3
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:19,663
Quite all right, Mrs. Nash.

4
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:22,538
Please don't be angry, Mr. Arthur.
My son is only joking.

5
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,441
- Good day.
- Mr. Arthur!

6
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,845
Stop. I'm gonna kill you.

7
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,177
- Can it wait? I gotta go to work.
- Work!

8
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,479
Someday you'll break your hands
doing that stupid work.

9
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,246
Then see if you'll ever play
Carnegie Hall.

10
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,550
I don't wanna play Carnegie Hall, Ma.

11
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,919
This week you don't wanna play.

12
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,687
I've been telling you that
since I was 7 years old.

13
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,365
So, what does
a 7-year-old boy know?

14
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:44,897
I gotta go.

15
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,569
Make sure you come back
with all your fingers.

16
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,237
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Argus.

17
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,373
Dad, Argus is the dog. I'm Henry.

18
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,041
Sorry, Henry.

19
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,584
Fourth down, five seconds to go.

20
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,023
Luckman licks his fingers.

21
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,161
Eyes the defense.

22
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,130
He sets.

23
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,803
Takes the snap,
hands off to Nagurski.

24
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:28,101
Bronko explodes. Knocks off
Farkas, straight-arms Todd.

25
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,142
Bodies are flying everywhere.
The crowd goes wild.

26
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,337
Left, right. Touchdown!

27
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,283
You're getting old, Butch.

28
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,427
Hop, look what I got here!

29
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,562
Hopper, where the hell
have you been?

30
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,399
Shooting down enemy aircraft.

31
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,075
Got an Airacobra P-39
over Pleasure Point.

32
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,404
The Airacobra P-39
is one of ours, Hop.

33
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,672
- Damn.
- Pick up 2, will you?

34
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,383
You better sharpen up, pal,
if you wanna be a Marine.

35
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,089
Hey. Anybody down there?

36
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:51,657
- Ah, Gatsby boys.
- Very lame.

37
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,061
Hey, sport, you wanna wait until
I got them set?

38
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,234
Hey, Hop, how about doubling
tomorrow night

39
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,770
with me and Sally at the movies?

40
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,374
- What's playing?
- Who cares?

41
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,605
Goddamn it!

42
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,287
What do you need me for?
You've been seeing her for months.

43
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,958
Sally's dad won't let her out anymore
unless she doubles.

44
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,253
- Why not?
- Her old man's got this idea

45
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:27,861
I been messing around with her.

46
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,060
Her old man's smart.

47
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,331
So, what do you say?

48
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,598
I don't know, Nicky.

49
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,471
I don't feel much like a movie.

50
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,302
Forget about the stinking movie,
will you, Hopper?

51
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,306
Since when do you watch
Carole Lombard?

52
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,012
I always watch Carole Lombard.

53
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:48,682
- Besides, I don't have anybody to take.
- Take Cindi.

54
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,285
Who took my...?

55
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,978
I like Cin...

56
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,283
Listen, asshole, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

57
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:01,019
- Yeah, what did you call me?
- Asshole. You heard me.

58
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,164
Rich bastards.

59
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,198
So it's all set, right?

60
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,767
- What?
- Me and Sally,

61
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,801
you and Cindi for tomorrow night.

62
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,906
I like Cindi.

63
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,700
So?

64
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,434
So, Nicky, when I double with you,
I don't take somebody I like.

65
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:18,614
That's just something I don't do.

66
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,413
All right, that's it. You son of a bitch.

67
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:28,749
Oh, boy.

68
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,255
Oh, shit.

69
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,687
Get back where you belong.

70
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,226
- All right. All right. All right. All right.
- Come on.

71
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,659
Break it up.

72
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,596
Break it up. I told you,
not on the lanes.

73
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,235
This guy tried to rivet me to the wall.

74
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,667
He was sleeping. He was talking
back there with his friend,

75
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,966
- instead of setting up the pins.
- You're full of crap.

76
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,665
Nicky, will you get
Hopper out of here?

77
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:51,870
Nicky, please, get Hopper out of here!

78
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:53,747
Cool him off.

79
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,814
All right, you, clean yourself up
in the bathroom.

80
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,178
- Pin boy.
- Look at my clothes.

81
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,115
- It's an honest living.
- Look at my clothes.

82
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:00,481
Okay, okay, okay, take Julie.

83
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,884
Take Nancy.

84
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,888
- Nancy?
- Why not?

85
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,691
Nancy's married.

86
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,658
All right, Nancy's out.

87
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:11,094
It doesn't matter who, it doesn't matter
what, as long as it looks like a girl.

88
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,427
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll drive out to the lake.

89
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,467
- You can even use the car.
- I don't know, Nicky.

90
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,730
All this back-seat stuff seems
kind of juvenile, you know.

91
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,874
Juvenile? Will you listen to this guy?

92
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,670
Nicky, I don't pay you
to be Hopper's shadow.

93
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,402
It doesn't even have to be a real date.

94
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,308
Just show up at her house
and con the old man.

95
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,211
- Boys, I need more gin.
- Take Alberta. Take...

96
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,181
I know what it is.

97
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,946
You're hot for Sally Kaiser.

98
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,987
- What?
- Either that or you don't think

99
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,489
I'm good enough for her.

100
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,990
Why does she go out with you?

101
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,961
One day at the drugstore,
we introduced ourselves over Cokes.

102
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,429
And I told her I would be
very honored if she...

103
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,261
Nicky, don't you ever think
about anything

104
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,529
- but hiking up some girl's dress?
- Like what?

105
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,907
Like... I don't know.

106
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:53,797
Like the future, son.

107
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,499
Hop, when you gonna wise up?

108
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,339
The only future we got
is Germans and Japs.

109
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,412
And the way I see it,
in the next six weeks,

110
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:02,675
I am gonna get everything I can.

111
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:06,445
I want my money!
What do you think, I do this for free?

112
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,583
Come on, sonny boy.

113
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,315
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

114
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,550
What's going on here, Annie?

115
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:14,889
Nothing, this guy just tried
to run off without paying his tab.

116
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:16,462
I'd pay if I were you, Joe.

117
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:19,896
This is my last day on furlough.
I swear, I don't have any money.

118
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:22,195
This is not the USO.

119
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,632
I'll take the watch.

120
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,329
My grandfather gave me that watch.

121
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,942
I wouldn't argue with the lady, buddy.
Get out of here.

122
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,842
Thanks, guys.

123
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:36,584
Well, love to stay and chat,
but I gotta pay the light bill,

124
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,219
know what I mean?

125
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,786
Hey, Annie, how would you
like to go on a date

126
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,981
tomorrow night with Hopper?

127
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,141
- What happened to your eye?
- Old man's drinking again.

128
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,942
Oh!

129
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,218
I got a run in my stocking.

130
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,426
I don't think we're gonna
get away with this.

131
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,505
You and Sally share classes?
I don't think she's mentioned you.

132
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,476
I graduated a long time ago.

133
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,613
Where'd you get that eye, son?

134
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,043
Bowling, sir.

135
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,877
Sorry I'm late.

136
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,919
Nicky, what happened to your eye?

137
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,021
I'll tell you about it later in the car.
Good night.

138
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,158
Could I have a drink or some candies
or something?

139
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,951
Let's go.

140
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,223
Sorry.

141
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,760
You have such a lovely living room.

142
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,559
Good night.

143
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:13,906
Here you are, kids.

144
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,515
I thought we were going
to the movies.

145
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,619
Yeah, well, Hop's gotta do
some Christmas shopping.

146
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:22,051
Bye, kids.

147
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,921
It was great, Hop.

148
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,661
Do you wanna go
for a sundae, maybe?

149
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,896
You mean, ice cream?

150
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,226
Yeah.

151
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:34,663
Sorry.

152
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,337
When do you ship out?

153
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,869
Six weeks.

154
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,132
Well, listen, angel face,

155
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,745
you're welcome to stop by for
a free ride on the old merry-go-round.

156
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,413
Thanks, Annie.

157
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,942
Oh, I almost forgot.

158
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,282
This is for you.

159
00:12:55,724 --> 00:13:00,889
Thanks, Hop, but I really can't,
I'm allergic.

160
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,911
One, please.

161
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:56,546
<i>On Capitol Hill, the teenage draft bill
holds the spotlight.</i>

162
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,448
<i>Young men all over the nation
flock to the colors.</i>

163
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:03,921
<i>The Army and the administration say,
"We need teenage manpower now. "</i>

164
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,787
<i>And here's the response.</i>

165
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:10,091
<i>- Well, goodbye, I'm going.
- All right now, be sure and write to us.</i>

166
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:16,534
<i>Bye.</i>

167
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,139
<i>Here is a typical report
from a teenage soldier of today.</i>

168
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,972
<i>I'm 19 years old.</i>

169
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,479
<i>Before entering the service, I was
a doorman at Radio City Music Hall.</i>

170
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,175
<i>After two weeks in the service,
I was appointed corporal...</i>

171
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,849
Come on.

172
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,831
Hi, Sally.

173
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,397
Hi, Hopper.

174
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,135
Where's Nicky?

175
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,107
Where'd you two go last night?

176
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,584
Over to the lake.

177
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,416
What's your dog's name?

178
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,548
Argus.

179
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,558
What's he wearing that for?

180
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,122
He got it for his birthday.

181
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,960
Come on, Argus, time to go home.

182
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,002
Come on. Bye.

183
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,839
Come on.

184
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:04,972
Goodbye.

185
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,823
Hey, Arnie, can we kill the angels?

186
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,991
God, I hate this music.
It reminds me of my Aunt Ida.

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,134
I ever tell you about my Aunt Ida?

188
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,071
Before my Ma died, during Christmas,
we used to have these family things.

189
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,732
And my Aunt Ida was always there
with her goddamn mistletoe hat.

190
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,469
And every time I turned around,
it was her cow lips,

191
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,013
her wet, puckered cow lips on my face.
It was awful.

192
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,719
- When did she die?
- She didn't.

193
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,787
Everyone else did. Practically everyone
in the whole goddamn family.

194
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,788
And I had this theory that it was my
Aunt Ida's kissing that was doing it.

195
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,757
Because they were all dropping dead
in January and February,

196
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,759
and she was doing all the kissing
in December.

197
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,489
There was a definite
cause-and-effect relationship there.

198
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,600
What is he, a friend of yours?

199
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:03,503
Hopper, why do you keep
looking over there?

200
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:05,897
No reason.

201
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:09,702
I saw Sally.

202
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,139
Oh, yeah? Where?

203
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,542
At the Point.

204
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,684
How'd it go with you two?

205
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,645
Okay, I guess. I think I spooked her.

206
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:26,058
- What do you mean?
- Who knows with women?

207
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,593
- Switch with me.
- What are you...?

208
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,991
- Switch places.
- Jesus, Hopper!

209
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,689
Hurry. There's a draft over...

210
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
- Oh, I see. Who is she?
- Who?

211
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,162
Screw, who is she?

212
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,066
- Some girl.
- Hey, Arnie, another victim.

213
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:41,968
May I help you?

214
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:44,441
Hi. Yes, what kind of pie
have you got today?

215
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:48,913
Brown pie.

216
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:51,950
All right, fine, I'll have a piece.

217
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,349
- And could you wrap it, please?
- You bet.

218
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,258
One piece of brown pie, coming up.

219
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,619
I'd like a piece, mister.

220
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,094
Just a minute, sir.
I'm waiting on the lady.

221
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,710
Oh, I just want one piece.

222
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:23,951
- It's on special today.
- Oh, thank you. That's very nice.

223
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,316
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

224
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,492
Hey, Hopper, what the hell
are you doing?

225
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,039
The man's out of his mind.

226
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:05,523
- Good night.
- Good night.

227
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,186
Hey.

228
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,224
Wait up.

229
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,798
Hopper, what the hell's
the matter with you?

230
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,915
Oh, Christ, she's a Gatsby.

231
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,587
She works at the goddamn
movie theater.

232
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,585
Her dad probably owns it.

233
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,054
Come on, lover boy, let's go home.

234
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,557
Come on.

235
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:24,204
Hey.

236
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,303
Hey.

237
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:30,144
Customer's not going anywhere,
you know.

238
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:36,507
Listen, Henry, I know how you
and Nicky wanna get into this thing.

239
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:39,312
But you gotta understand
it's different for your mother.

240
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,546
This war, it just scares her.

241
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,454
That's why she's riding you so hard.

242
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:47,388
Now...

243
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:49,954
...when you get over there,
I want you to write.

244
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,760
Doesn't have to be much, just
a few lines, so she can sleep easier.

245
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,296
You think you can do that, son?

246
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,142
I bet she looks like a rose
and smells as sweet.

247
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,439
What's her name?

248
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,147
I don't even know.

249
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,562
P-47 Thunderbolt.

250
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,291
Bullet-shaped spinner.

251
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,668
Straight trailing.

252
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,803
How the hell should I know?

253
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,577
Oh, Christ.

254
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:15,372
Oh, Mrs. Spangler.

255
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,552
Religion's a little shaky.

256
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:20,152
Oh, I forgot, I have to call
Sam O'Reilly about that.

257
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,118
I better do it now.

258
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,622
Damn it, Elmer.

259
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,696
Someday I'm gonna take that cane
away from you.

260
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,908
Hi.

261
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,344
- Hi.
- How was the pie?

262
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,880
Fine.

263
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,656
Can I help you with something?

264
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,022
Oh, no, thanks, just doing
a little college prep work.

265
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,491
I can see.

266
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:10,064
- Hey, what's your name?
- Why?

267
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:11,564
What do you mean, why?

268
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,840
I don't go out with strangers.

269
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,374
Who said anything about going out?

270
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,078
Besides, if you told me your name,
we wouldn't be strangers.

271
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,317
I don't think so.

272
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,888
Hey, how'd you like the flowers?

273
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,914
Oh, so you're the one!

274
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,324
Well, at least you're harmless.

275
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:34,790
Harmless?

276
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:36,963
What the hell's that mean?

277
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,963
I mean, you could've been
some kind of maniac.

278
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,527
Well, what makes you think
I'm so harmless?

279
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,498
It's not supposed to be an insult.
What are you, some kind of a dolt?

280
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,335
Oh, first I'm harmless, now...

281
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,541
What the hell is this?

282
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:02,416
Oh, I take it back,
you are definitely not harmless.

283
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,493
Oh, isn't he a dream?

284
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,719
Just looking at him
makes me feel dizzy.

285
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:11,160
- What'll it be, girls?
- I'll have a grilled-cheese sandwich

286
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,197
- and a cherry Coke.
- Me too.

287
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,635
- So did you think about it?
- What?

288
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:17,862
You know, Christmas Eve.

289
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,098
- Oh, Gretchen.
- And?

290
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,276
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:25,068
Blind dates again. I hate new towns.

292
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,838
Oh, come on, Caddie,
it'll be good for you.

293
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,447
We'll have a ball, I promise.

294
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,808
Just one night, right?

295
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,542
He's shipping out
the day after Christmas.

296
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:33,516
- You'll never see him again.
- You'll be there?

297
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,916
- Every second.
- Do you promise?

298
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:36,317
- Yes.
- Okay.

299
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:37,582
Thanks, Caddie!

300
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,417
He really... He's a dream!

301
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,461
If he wasn't my cousin,
I'd go out with him.

302
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,132
He looks just like Robert Walker.

303
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,962
- I bet.
- Well, sort of.

304
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,603
Who are you going with?

305
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:53,330
I don't know. I was gonna go
with Bobby Michaels,

306
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,203
but he says he's sworn off women
for the duration.

307
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,038
Yeah, this war
is driving them all crazy.

308
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,111
Why not go with one of the boys
from the theater?

309
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,579
Too fresh. Last night,
Eddie Richards tried to drag me

310
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:04,718
behind the popcorn machine.

311
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,548
You're lucky you're in the booth.
Inside is hell.

312
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,285
Hey, what about this guy?

313
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,755
Henry? How do you know him?

314
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,931
Henry and I sort of ran into each other
at the library.

315
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,624
Henry Nash in the library?

316
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,427
I didn't even think he knew
how to read.

317
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,434
He's sort of cute, don't you think?

318
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:25,731
Well...

319
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,406
- Yeah, but I couldn't just ask him.
- Oh, come on.

320
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,171
- No, I couldn't ask him.
- Leave it to me. I'll do it. I'll do it.

321
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,314
- Okay.
- Just watch this.

322
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:37,684
Henry?

323
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:43,550
I have to apologize, I'm afraid
I was awfully rude earlier.

324
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:46,022
- Oh, that's all right.
- I didn't introduce myself.

325
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:48,354
- My name's Caddie Winger.
- Henry Nash.

326
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:51,121
Oh, it's a pleasure, Henry.

327
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,061
Are you working this afternoon?

328
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:54,732
Working?

329
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,836
Yeah, you work here, don't you?

330
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,901
Oh, you mean last night.
No, I was just helping out.

331
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:01,200
Oh, that was nice of you.

332
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,536
- I do what I can.
- Yeah.

333
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,738
Henry, I don't suppose
you're free on Christmas Eve?

334
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,042
- Christmas Eve?
- Yeah, you're probably spending it

335
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:13,049
- with your family.
- Oh, with my family, right. No.

336
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:14,721
Oh, no?

337
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:20,388
Well, what I mean is, I would be,
but my mom, that's my mother,

338
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,393
she's gonna be working
with the USO that night.

339
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,429
And Dad...

340
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,895
Dad's...

341
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,730
- Dad's going fishing.
- Fishing?

342
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,203
- Yeah.
- On Christmas Eve?

343
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:34,534
Yeah.

344
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,002
At night?

345
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,046
Well, yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

346
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,182
You know how other people
have turkey on Christmas?

347
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:43,714
We have fish.

348
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:50,750
Oh, that's great. Well, then,
you are free Christmas Eve?

349
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,887
Definitely.

350
00:26:53,128 --> 00:26:54,959
- You wanna go out?
- Definitely.

351
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:58,394
Really? Oh, that's great.
I believe you know Gretchen.

352
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,158
- Hi, Henry.
- Hi.

353
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,696
You two will have
such a wonderful time, I know it.

354
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:07,204
It's perfect.
So anyway, we'll see you there.

355
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,476
- Yeah, okay, see you there.
- Okay.

356
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,380
Okay.

357
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,950
Oh, Henry, we're gonna go
roller-skating. We'll meet at 7.

358
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:21,611
- You do roller-skate, don't you?
- Sure.

359
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:32,263
<i>Our men are the best-fed, best-paid,
best-uniformed soldiers in this war.</i>

360
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,164
You look like a used-car salesman.

361
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,606
Where are you going
dressed like that?

362
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,678
I got a date.

363
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,311
With who?

364
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,416
A girl.

365
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,449
What are you, Mr. District Attorney?

366
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:55,553
A boy should stay home with his family
on Christmas Eve.

367
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,157
I'll be home all day tomorrow, Ma.

368
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,255
Merry Christmas.

369
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,527
Hey.

370
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,528
Oh, hi, Dad. Thanks for the flowers.

371
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:09,969
Yeah, you look just like I did
the first time I wore that suit.

372
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:13,767
- You don't think it's too big?
- You'll grow into it.

373
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,169
By 8:00?

374
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,419
There he is, I see him.

375
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,389
Hey, Nash.

376
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,068
You got your skates.

377
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,638
Yeah, they wouldn't let me in
unless I put them on first.

378
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:31,418
This is Michael.

379
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,985
- Henry Nash.
- Glad to meet you.

380
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,924
Michael just got his wings.

381
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:39,120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

382
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,692
What branch are you joining?

383
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:43,420
- Marines.
- Tough group.

384
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:46,031
I'll try not to drop anything
on you, huh?

385
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,735
Sorry, everybody. Hi, Henry.

386
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,373
These are for you.

387
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,769
Oh, they're beautiful.

388
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:57,410
Where'd you get them?

389
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:59,944
I just kind of picked them up.

390
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,948
Henry's very big on flowers.

391
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,311
Aren't you?

392
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,444
Yeah, sure.

393
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:11,186
Well, shall we?

394
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,950
All right.

395
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,532
Something wrong?

396
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:23,167
No. Go ahead.
I'm just gonna warm up.

397
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,066
Okay.

398
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,212
Hey, mister, leave me alone.

399
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,456
Hey.

400
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,337
Let go of my hand.

401
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,376
Let go of my hand.

402
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,219
Let go!

403
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,627
That looked scary.

404
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,967
Only if you don't know
what you're doing.

405
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,727
That was great.

406
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:31,404
Thanks very much.

407
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,540
Does anyone feel like
taking a breather?

408
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,072
I wouldn't mind.

409
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:38,302
Well, Gretch, I guess
it's you and me, huh?

410
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,904
You damn Marines.

411
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,640
- You need a hand, huh?
- I do, yes.

412
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:57,698
Hey, buddy. Hey, you're not allowed
on the floor without any skates.

413
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,665
- No drinks either.
- Relax, I'm leaving.

414
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,400
Here.

415
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,302
Must've gotten a bad pair of skates.

416
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,275
Yeah.

417
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:18,877
So tell me about Michael.

418
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,921
What do you wanna know
about Michael?

419
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:27,392
Like...

420
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,057
Like, is he my boyfriend
or something?

421
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:32,664
Excuse me?

422
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,872
So your dad's out fishing tonight,
isn't he?

423
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,062
Fishing, right.

424
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,502
No.

425
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,309
No?

426
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,810
- I sort of lied.
- You did? Why'd you do that?

427
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:55,082
What does your dad do?

428
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:02,157
He's a gravedigger.

429
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,594
It's not all just digging holes,
like everybody thinks.

430
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,927
There's the grass and the flowers
to look after.

431
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:09,831
Trees always need cutting back.

432
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:13,370
Something about being near the ocean
makes everything grow faster.

433
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,269
That's what he says.

434
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,608
He keeps it real nice.

435
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,542
It's a nice place.

436
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,545
Why don't you
take me there sometime.

437
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,518
She's a Gatsby girl.

438
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:32,488
If you ask me, you're barking
up the wrong pair of gams.

439
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:33,660
Who asked?

440
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,557
- I'm just looking out for you!
- Right.

441
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,998
All right, wise guy, listen to this:

442
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,065
I heard the Nazis got this thing, right?

443
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,829
It comes right out of the ground
and goes right for it.

444
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:46,029
Blows the whole package right off.

445
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,868
One second, you're John Wayne,
and the next, you're Minnie Mouse.

446
00:33:49,076 --> 00:33:50,976
- Nicky, there are other things.
- Yeah?

447
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,146
- Yeah.
- Like what?

448
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:53,313
Like, other things.

449
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:56,745
Okay. I just hate to see you spend
the last few weeks of your manhood

450
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,079
- chasing something you can't catch.
- Go away.

451
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:03,647
Oh, I get it!

452
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,325
You want a picture for your wallet.

453
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,586
You want some girl who's gonna send
you flowers, poems and sweethearts...

454
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,229
- Shut up!
- That's it, isn't it?

455
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,729
- Yeah, well, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

456
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,693
But I'll tell you something.
I ain't gonna be no sap to some skirt.

457
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:19,964
Because when I finish killing Japs,
I ain't coming back here.

458
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,665
I want nothing to do with this place.

459
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:36,917
- Give me your hand.
- Thank you.

460
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,834
- Here.
- What is this place?

461
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:56,805
Danny's Tap Room.

462
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,903
Or what's left of it.

463
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,808
This is the stage.

464
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,476
That...

465
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,413
...used to be the bar.

466
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,147
Over in the corner used to be
a couple of nickelodeon machines.

467
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,587
They're gone now.
My dad used to sneak me in here.

468
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,255
What do you do here?

469
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,522
Whatever I want.

470
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,466
What do you think?

471
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,394
It's kind of spooky.

472
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,333
- You wanna leave?
- No.

473
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,402
Just feels like someone's listening.

474
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,381
What is this?

475
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,020
This is...

476
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,621
...the best thing about this place.

477
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,758
A piano.

478
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,418
Does it work?

479
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:49,152
- Plays up a storm.
- It couldn't.

480
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:50,728
It could. It's magic.

481
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,228
- Magic?
- Magic.

482
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:53,593
- Do you play?
- A little.

483
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:55,393
Play something.

484
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,009
Not a key sticks.

485
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,489
How'd you learn to play like that?

486
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,523
Lessons.

487
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:57,160
The day Eddie Richards tries to throw
Tommy Lester out at third base...

488
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,832
...hits him in the head...

489
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,625
...I'm doing this...

490
00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:07,500
...for Mr. Arthur, my teacher.

491
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:10,035
Tommy gets a concussion...

492
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:11,975
...and I miss it.

493
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:15,572
And I've never forgiven my mother
for that.

494
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,411
Wish I could play like that.

495
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:22,647
Come here.

496
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,017
Come here, I'll teach you.

497
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:25,882
Come on, sit down.

498
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,932
Okay, give me your hand.

499
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,997
Okay, you do this.

500
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:43,436
Repeat it.

501
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:55,684
That's it?

502
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,380
Well, you could try my part.

503
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:59,183
What's your part?

504
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,030
Think I'd better go.

505
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:45,998
When do you leave?

506
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,636
Next month.

507
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:16,357
- Hi. Sorry, I forgot my key.
- Oh, it's all right.

508
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,967
- What's this?
- Alice brought you a present.

509
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:20,534
Oh, they're back.

510
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:22,394
- Did you get something?
- Yes.

511
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:25,666
She gave me some scented soap,
and they gave me a robe.

512
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:27,942
Is it pretty?

513
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:29,942
It's pretty. It's a size 44.

514
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:32,707
- It's pretty.
- Oh, Mom.

515
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:36,519
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

516
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,881
I'm gonna try it on.

517
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,395
Just a minute.

518
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,032
- Alice, this is beautiful.
- Well, I thought it would be.

519
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:02,769
You know, it annoys the hell out of me
that I can't wear that color.

520
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,880
I don't know what to say.

521
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,183
- "Merry Christmas" will do.
- Merry Christmas.

522
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:10,978
Merry Christmas, Caddie.

523
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,089
Sit down.

524
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,553
I thought that your first Christmas
in a new town,

525
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,731
where you knew maybe three people,
wouldn't be your favorite.

526
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,524
Thank you, Alice.

527
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:25,668
Alice.

528
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:28,437
Hello, Caddie. Merry Christmas.
Don't you look pretty!

529
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,436
Merry Christmas, Mr. Donnelly.

530
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:33,770
Alice, I'm down in the pantry
with whipped cream and eggs

531
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:37,140
- all over the place. Will you hurry?
- I'm hurrying, Daddy.

532
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,077
How do you like those pearls, Caddie?

533
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,807
Beautiful.

534
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,014
- Please, darling.
- Yes, Daddy.

535
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:56,288
- Hey, Nash.
- Hi.

536
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,425
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

537
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,728
Sometimes I just don't make it.

538
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:03,996
How come?

539
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,900
I don't know. Figure, what's the point?

540
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,677
If you were in school, you wouldn't
have to leave so soon.

541
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,283
Well, a war's going on. I'm gonna have
to go sooner or later. What about you?

542
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:18,319
Oh, I got to finish up early at my
old school because we were moving.

543
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:19,955
Oh, that's good.

544
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:23,285
So I guess you got plans
for this morning.

545
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,359
No.

546
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:28,123
You?

547
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,399
No.

548
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:33,462
No, I don't.

549
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:42,406
- Sure you know where you're going?
- Positive.

550
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:44,706
Nicky put an arrow
around here someplace.

551
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:46,041
That tree!

552
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,980
There's an arrow on the other side
of that tree.

553
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:54,622
- There is!
- That arrow points directly to the pond.

554
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:56,588
Good ol' Nicky.

555
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,789
Points straight up.

556
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,624
Nicky always was a fool.

557
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,300
Well...

558
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:05,760
We know it's not that way,

559
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:08,631
so it's gotta be that way,
that way or that way.

560
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:10,567
Or somewhere in between.

561
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:12,139
Right.

562
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,508
I wish Argus was here.

563
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,452
You found it?

564
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,423
Oh, that's beautiful.

565
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:39,902
How did you find this place anyway?

566
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:42,401
My father sort of gave it
to me and Nicky.

567
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:43,595
Gave it to you?

568
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,966
He'd make these maps,
these treasure maps,

569
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:47,609
and then me and Nicky
would follow them

570
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:50,712
and dig whatever was up
at the other end.

571
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:52,609
One time we ended up here.

572
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:54,707
He wrapped up this watch.

573
00:42:54,918 --> 00:42:56,317
See there?

574
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,348
And he put it out there in the middle.

575
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:00,523
Me and Nicky spent
what must've been about an hour

576
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:02,658
sloshing around in the mud
on the bottom.

577
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,452
Crawling around.

578
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,991
I don't think my dad cared
whether we ever found the watch.

579
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:09,665
It was this place.

580
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,164
Yeah.

581
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:14,336
He sounds wonderful.

582
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:17,639
What do you say we cool off?

583
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:22,335
It's January.

584
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:23,979
It's hot.

585
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:26,974
Henry, we can come back
in the spring, when it warms up.

586
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:29,084
I won't be here when it warms up.

587
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:31,447
Come on, what do you say?

588
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:35,450
- It's hot.
- It's hot.

589
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:38,492
Hot! I'm so hot.

590
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:44,963
I don't have my bathing suit on.

591
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:51,837
Well, when me and Nicky came here,
we never used to wear bathing suits.

592
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,680
All right.

593
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:06,913
You can wear your understuff
if you wanna.

594
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,490
Seeing as it's January and all.

595
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:29,602
Come on, it's great!

596
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:37,009
Come on!

597
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,626
Hurry up!

598
00:44:46,263 --> 00:44:48,128
Just jump in.

599
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:57,270
It's pretty cold.

600
00:45:01,011 --> 00:45:03,809
So does anybody else
know about this place?

601
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:05,709
I don't think so.

602
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,846
- I guess we have it to ourselves, then.
- Yeah. Guess so.

603
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:18,628
You know, it's not that bad.
I think I'm getting used to it.

604
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,287
Yeah, your body just has to adjust.

605
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,161
What made you think of coming here?

606
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,135
I don't know.

607
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:30,670
It's one of my favorite places.

608
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:37,404
You're shaking.

609
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:39,275
So are you.

610
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,087
She's a nice girl.

611
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:26,322
And money on top of it all.

612
00:47:26,523 --> 00:47:28,047
You're lucky, Hop.

613
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:34,427
I think she's the one, Nicky.

614
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:36,722
You know what I mean?

615
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:41,897
Johnny Lester came in today.

616
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:43,970
His brother's dead.

617
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:45,901
Tommy?

618
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:48,009
He died on an island.

619
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:50,713
Guadel, or...

620
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:53,844
- Guod...
- Guadalcanal.

621
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,449
Yeah.

622
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:59,681
Funeral's tomorrow.
Johnny said we're invited. Wanna go?

623
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,048
- I don't think so.
- Yeah.

624
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:03,658
Me either.

625
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,671
You know what I want, Henry?

626
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,241
I want an eagle right here.

627
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:23,503
A tattoo. Yeah.

628
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:28,047
Just wait till those Japs see me and
my eagle come charging over the hill.

629
00:48:28,251 --> 00:48:30,981
Just come charging over the hill.

630
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:37,324
There's a war out there
somewhere, Hop.

631
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:44,628
So they're in this submarine, right?

632
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:46,996
And the Japs are going at them
with everything they got.

633
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:49,035
Guys are drowning. Guys are on fire.

634
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:51,298
There are sharks, and they got guns.

635
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:54,375
So you know
what Tyrone Power says?

636
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:56,876
He says, "Fuck them!" Just like that.

637
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,672
Tyrone Power never said,
"Fuck them. "

638
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:00,349
Right. And that's when he does it.

639
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,144
He just... He just surfaces
in the middle of Tokyo Harbor.

640
00:49:03,353 --> 00:49:05,116
Jeez!

641
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,290
What balls!

642
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,481
Maybe we should join
the submarine corps.

643
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:11,285
Pussies.

644
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:16,028
- What?
- They're pussies!

645
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:19,301
No, Tyrone Power is not a pussy.

646
00:49:20,003 --> 00:49:22,563
You wouldn't know a pussy
if you saw one.

647
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:25,605
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. You know why?

648
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,208
You know why?

649
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,037
Because you drink too much.

650
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:30,838
- Me?!
- Pisses me off!

651
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:34,016
Pisses me off badly!

652
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:38,352
Because when you drink too much,
it makes your brain soft.

653
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:41,457
Let me see...
I gotta show you something.

654
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:46,756
Before I started drinking,
I could not do that!

655
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:50,160
- Why would you wanna do that?
- It gives me pleasure.

656
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,573
Right here!

657
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:01,869
Clear across my goddamn chest.

658
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:04,410
- A real patriot, huh?
- Damn right!

659
00:50:04,614 --> 00:50:06,980
In just four short weeks,
me and my buddy here

660
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:10,118
are gonna be proud members
of the United States Marine Corps.

661
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,151
Lucky us.

662
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:14,354
Listen, kid,

663
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:16,081
I'm gonna do you a favor.

664
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,284
I'm not gonna put anything
on your chest.

665
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,190
That way, when you wake up
in the morning,

666
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:24,299
you still will have that wonderful
baby-pink skin.

667
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:26,267
You'll thank me, believe me.

668
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:30,405
Hey, wait a minute. This is the bird
of freedom we're talking about here.

669
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:33,770
Ain't no American that wouldn't be
proud to carry that over his heart.

670
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:35,706
You ought to cut down
on the newsreels, kid.

671
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:38,574
Hey, what is this,
you give tattoos or advice?

672
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:42,312
All right, how much do you boys got?

673
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:47,079
I...

674
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:50,321
...got $1.25.

675
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:51,926
I got 13 cents.

676
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:56,394
A dollar thirty-eight will get you
a sparrow on your elbow.

677
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,525
- A sparrow?
- Or how about a snake

678
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:02,728
coming out of your navel?
Now, that's real popular!

679
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:05,669
You've gotta be kidding!
He's kidding, right, Hop?

680
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,903
I'm talking about the high-flying red-
white-and-blue bird of freedom here!

681
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:14,544
Bird of freedom don't come cheap.

682
00:51:18,888 --> 00:51:21,686
A snake coming out of my navel.

683
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:24,416
He's probably some kind of a Nazi.

684
00:51:28,164 --> 00:51:29,495
Hey...

685
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:31,064
...listen.

686
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:33,698
It's the train.

687
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:36,899
Touch the rail with your shoe,
you can feel it.

688
00:51:41,444 --> 00:51:43,844
Let's race it, like when we were kids.

689
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:46,882
We're drunk.

690
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:49,877
Who cares? I wanna race it.

691
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:52,554
- We'll get killed.
- No, we won't.

692
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:55,855
No, we won't.
This train's an old friend.

693
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:58,289
It would never hurt us.

694
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:00,861
Here she comes!

695
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,656
Come on, Hopper!

696
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,697
Race with me!

697
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:09,071
Race with me!

698
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,840
Race with me!

699
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,750
Race with me, Hop!

700
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:25,439
Nicky!

701
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:30,175
Nicky!

702
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:34,314
Nicky!

703
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,069
Hey, Nicky, where you going?

704
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,708
Hey, wait up, will you?

705
00:53:58,548 --> 00:53:59,810
Are you all right?

706
00:54:00,016 --> 00:54:01,711
She's late, Hop.

707
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:03,283
What?

708
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,645
Sally. She's pregnant.

709
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:07,618
What are you talking about?

710
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:10,418
Three weeks till we leave,
and she hits me with this.

711
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:13,357
She told me this afternoon.
You gotta help me, Hop.

712
00:54:13,563 --> 00:54:15,053
I don't know
what you're talking about.

713
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:16,823
To get the money.

714
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:18,022
Money?

715
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,963
For an abortion.

716
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,500
An abortion? Nicky!

717
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:24,701
Didn't you use anything?

718
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:26,398
It just happened.

719
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:29,100
Just happened? Nicky, you been
seeing this girl for four months!

720
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:30,438
So?!

721
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:34,242
- So Jesus Christ, Nicky!
- "So Jesus Christ, Nicky. "

722
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,248
"Jesus Christ, Nicky!"
I'm paying for it, all right?!

723
00:54:37,453 --> 00:54:39,853
No, she's paying for it, Nicky!

724
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,785
She's paying for it!

725
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:44,984
Hop.

726
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,595
Hop, since when did you become
such a saint, huh?

727
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:48,889
Huh, Hop?

728
00:54:49,098 --> 00:54:51,464
The only difference between me
and you is you've been lucky.

729
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,363
That's all!

730
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:56,028
That's it, Hop!

731
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,765
How much?

732
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,369
Annie says it costs 150
for a clean one.

733
00:55:28,571 --> 00:55:31,199
A hundred-fifty? Nicky, where are we
gonna get that kind of money?

734
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:32,396
Do like we did last summer,

735
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,543
when we needed a transmission
for the Plymouth.

736
00:55:34,744 --> 00:55:36,735
We almost got killed!

737
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:40,274
Well, what other way is there?

738
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,816
I'll think about it. Come on.

739
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,482
My dear friends in Christ,

740
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:23,557
we are gathered here today to lay to
rest the soul of Thomas Alan Lester,

741
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,695
who gave his life
for the service of his country.

742
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:34,635
To the flag, face!

743
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:42,242
To the front, face!

744
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,773
Forward, hup!

745
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:55,289
To the flag, face!

746
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,310
Hello there, stranger.

747
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:19,580
You up early or late?

748
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:22,310
Late.

749
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:25,483
Let your mother know next time,
all right?

750
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:26,780
Okay.

751
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,220
You wanna talk?

752
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:46,766
Let's hurry, nurses,
we don't want to lose anyone!

753
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:50,904
More volume, Arnold!

754
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:54,880
And remember, soldiers,

755
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:58,815
if you're wounded, remain lying down
until a nurse reaches you.

756
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,054
If you're dead,

757
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:03,157
remain lying down.

758
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:05,691
Try and give a little comfort
to your patient.

759
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:09,463
Remember, blood doesn't bother you,

760
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:11,690
because you're professional nurses.

761
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,961
I think he might be dead already.
Oh, sorry.

762
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:17,435
- Where are you hurt, soldier?
- He slipped away.

763
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,164
Wait a minute,
I seem to be coming around.

764
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,809
- I'll come back when you got this.
- No, wait! Please, nurse!

765
00:58:22,011 --> 00:58:23,273
I wanna show you my wound.

766
00:58:23,479 --> 00:58:24,741
- R.D. Stop.
- Why?

767
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:26,107
Get on!

768
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,373
- What are you guys doing?
- Go to the records.

769
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:33,713
You're looking after a sick man,
so be very, very careful.

770
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:35,447
That's the idea.

771
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,457
That's the idea.

772
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:41,890
You might get some bandages there
on your left.

773
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:44,931
Arnold, go to the office. Your mother
called. You gotta call her right away.

774
00:58:45,134 --> 00:58:46,726
- What about my records?
- We'll watch them!

775
00:58:46,936 --> 00:58:48,267
- But...
- It's an emergency, Arnold.

776
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:50,837
No "buts," man! Hop to it!
It's your mom!

777
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,008
<i>Hurry! Berlin Blitz is just about to end.</i>

778
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:55,769
Prepare for the worst shelling yet.

779
00:59:11,594 --> 00:59:13,494
What the hell is going on here?

780
00:59:13,696 --> 00:59:17,325
Stop that carrying on, will you?!
Just hold it!

781
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:20,733
Stop that!

782
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:34,374
That's not funny.

783
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,814
- It's a joke.
- It's not funny.

784
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:39,249
- It's not a funny joke?
- No.

785
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:42,186
You know, you're really
stupid sometimes.

786
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:44,219
What's that supposed to mean?

787
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:46,156
What're you doing right now?

788
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:49,358
- Bleeding.
- I can see that.

789
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:52,466
Why don't you go get yourself
cleaned up and meet me outside.

790
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:55,364
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

791
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,941
- It's a hospital.
- That's right. Smart.

792
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,405
- Hi, Barbara.
- I'm smart.

793
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:05,046
- Yeah, you're smarter than you look.
- I'm smarter than I look?

794
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:07,148
That's good.

795
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,246
Good idea. You having fun?

796
01:00:11,454 --> 01:00:14,287
- I'm having a real good time.
- Oh, I'm glad.

797
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,822
I'm glad you're having fun.

798
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:18,391
Hi!

799
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:21,888
You know who's in here?

800
01:00:22,698 --> 01:00:25,292
- Sick people.
- That's right. You wanna go in?

801
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:28,026
- You bet!
- Okay.

802
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:32,431
Here we are!

803
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:45,147
All right.

804
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:48,084
Henry Nash, right here. Henry Nash.

805
01:00:52,094 --> 01:00:54,085
He's my bodyguard.

806
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:58,097
All right? So don't try any funny stuff,
because I know what you're up to here.

807
01:00:58,301 --> 01:01:01,429
Henry, give each person
on this side a book.

808
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:04,197
Leave one on the empty beds,
because that means they're in therapy.

809
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:07,342
Good. Hi. I'm glad you're up.

810
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:18,446
- Oh, good, you found it.
- They had it on order or something.

811
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,722
- What would you like?
- You got any Hammett?

812
01:01:25,928 --> 01:01:29,022
- Hammett?
- Yeah. Dashiell Hammett.

813
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:34,266
- I'll check the cart.
- That's okay. Forget it.

814
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:38,065
- It'll just take a second.
- No, that's all right. Relax, forget it.

815
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,307
What's your name?

816
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:42,872
Henry, sir.

817
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:45,946
How old are you?

818
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:47,740
Seventeen, sir.

819
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:50,948
How old do you think I am?

820
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,320
I'm 22.

821
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:59,858
You call everybody who's 22 "sir"?

822
01:02:00,162 --> 01:02:02,926
No, sir. I mean, no.

823
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,600
My name's Frank.

824
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:09,930
Guess they'll be calling you up
pretty soon, huh, Henry?

825
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:12,441
February 12th.

826
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:19,474
Go ahead, look at it.

827
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:24,878
I do. All day long.

828
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,381
Sometimes, you know, I can still feel it.

829
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:31,992
That's the God's truth.

830
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:37,132
Only I half-believe it's gone.

831
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,358
Get it?

832
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:41,331
Half.

833
01:02:46,842 --> 01:02:50,107
I'll just... Give me whatever
you got there, I don't...

834
01:02:51,514 --> 01:02:53,141
Thanks.

835
01:03:01,457 --> 01:03:03,015
Henry.

836
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:15,459
There's a train that runs through here.

837
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,332
Freight.

838
01:03:17,973 --> 01:03:20,100
Me and Nicky must've raced it
about a hundred times.

839
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:24,006
You get close enough, you can
feel the heat on your legs.

840
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:26,010
Gondola car's your best bet.

841
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:28,240
It's got these handles
that stick out on the sides.

842
01:03:28,451 --> 01:03:30,112
Once you get your grip, it's easy.

843
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,152
You just pull up and let her take you.

844
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:34,651
You gotta be careful
when you jump,

845
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,291
because the wind will blow
you right under.

846
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:39,017
That sounds dangerous.

847
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:40,252
That's why we did it.

848
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:43,763
If you think I needed you to teach me
some kind of lesson today,

849
01:03:43,966 --> 01:03:45,490
you're wrong!

850
01:03:48,037 --> 01:03:50,028
I'm sorry.

851
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,170
I'm sorry I took you in there.

852
01:03:54,677 --> 01:03:57,646
It's just, you made me
so mad this morning.

853
01:04:01,016 --> 01:04:03,780
How come you never talk about it?

854
01:04:03,986 --> 01:04:05,078
What?

855
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:06,549
The war.

856
01:04:07,056 --> 01:04:09,650
- Well, what's there to talk about?
- You must think about it.

857
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:12,589
I think about it all the time.

858
01:04:12,928 --> 01:04:17,456
I mean, before, it was just there, but in
the last few weeks, being around you...

859
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:20,157
...I think about things.

860
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,370
Like what sort of things?

861
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:28,310
Coming back.

862
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:32,841
I'm gonna be all right, you know?

863
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:01,766
<i>Tangerine</i>

864
01:06:02,638 --> 01:06:06,699
<i>She is all they claim</i>

865
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:15,307
<i>With her eyes of night
And lips as bright as flame</i>

866
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:19,351
<i>Tangerine</i>

867
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:24,082
<i>When she dances by</i>

868
01:06:25,094 --> 01:06:32,364
<i>Seńoritas stare and caballeros sigh</i>

869
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:37,096
<i>And I've seen</i>

870
01:06:37,306 --> 01:06:41,402
<i>Times when Tangerine</i>

871
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:50,216
<i>Had the bourgeoisie
Believing she were queen</i>

872
01:06:50,753 --> 01:06:55,087
<i>Yes, she's had them all on the run</i>

873
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:59,387
<i>But her heart belongs to just one</i>

874
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:05,795
<i>Her heart belongs to Tangerine</i>

875
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:13,841
Nicky!

876
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:16,534
Why do I let you work here?

877
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:17,734
Because when the heat's on,

878
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:20,575
there's nobody can lay down
a set of pins faster than me.

879
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:23,149
- I'm the best you got.
- No, you're not.

880
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:24,979
Oh.

881
01:07:25,187 --> 01:07:27,951
Well, then, you got me, boss.

882
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:34,085
So?

883
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:36,998
So, what?

884
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,794
- So you said you'd think about it.
- About what?

885
01:07:41,303 --> 01:07:43,771
Come on! Sally, the money.

886
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,403
I am thinking about it.

887
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,075
Hop, we only got a couple weeks.

888
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,238
Shit.

889
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:16,671
Come on, get up. Get up.

890
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:18,703
Get up!

891
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:29,348
Get up, come on.

892
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:34,521
Okay, you're gonna get it.

893
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:38,022
You are going to be sorry.

894
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:40,487
You see this?

895
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:42,891
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry! Oh, I didn't...

896
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,566
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, come here,
let me see.

897
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,999
Let me see.
Oh, I got you in the eye. Oh.

898
01:08:56,879 --> 01:09:01,111
Oh, look at those shoes,
aren't they pretty? See.

899
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:03,580
Don't you like those?

900
01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:09,689
I love those. Aren't they beautiful?

901
01:09:11,226 --> 01:09:14,525
- How they feel?
- I like them.

902
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:20,024
- I love them.
- Of course.

903
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,032
They were made for you!

904
01:09:22,237 --> 01:09:25,172
- How much are they?
- Oh, $25.

905
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:26,932
Twenty-five!

906
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:31,010
It's not unreasonable for such
marvelous work, don't you think?

907
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,149
Not unreasonable.

908
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:38,113
Well, thank you.

909
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,288
That's all right. You think about it.

910
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:41,956
You'll come back, I'm sure.

911
01:09:42,157 --> 01:09:44,785
- Oh, thank you. Yeah.
- Well, anyway...

912
01:09:46,528 --> 01:09:48,189
- I really... I love them.
- It's a pleasure.

913
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,864
Thanks a lot.

914
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,397
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Henry.

915
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:55,962
What happened?

916
01:09:56,605 --> 01:09:58,869
You didn't buy the shoes.

917
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:01,133
Of course not.

918
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:06,170
You can't just buy everything
you want, you know.

919
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:09,977
That's right. I can't.

920
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:15,651
I'm just kidding you, Gatsby girl.

921
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:23,194
What? But how?

922
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:24,258
What? But how?

923
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:26,331
I don't know.

924
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:29,567
- It's not funny.
- Well, it is, sort of.

925
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:31,864
- Well, it is sort of funny, isn't it?
- It isn't, no.

926
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:33,939
Look, did you actually ever
tell him you were rich?

927
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:35,576
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.

928
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,335
No skin off your nose, right?

929
01:10:37,546 --> 01:10:40,845
If he wants to believe that he
is stuck on some rich girl, let him.

930
01:10:41,049 --> 01:10:43,244
As far as I can see,
you've got no problem.

931
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,188
I don't know.
Maybe that's why he likes me.

932
01:10:47,389 --> 01:10:50,119
Well, so what? I mean,
he's leaving soon anyway.

933
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:53,419
I mean, it's not like you're in love
with him or anything, right?

934
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,302
Uh-oh.

935
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,343
One thirty-five, please.

936
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:19,014
- Hi.
- Caddie.

937
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:20,586
- I thought you had to work.
- I do.

938
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:22,950
I just thought I'd drop by,
thought maybe we could talk.

939
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:24,785
- We're kind of busy. Hi, R.D.
- Hi, Hop.

940
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,359
- Is 1 and 2 open?
- Yeah.

941
01:11:28,964 --> 01:11:30,591
You're coming to
my birthday tomorrow, right?

942
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:32,391
- Yeah.
- It's not much, just you and Nicky,

943
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:34,034
probably.

944
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:37,464
I wanna talk because...

945
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:41,036
Caddie, I gotta...
Just sit down a second, okay?

946
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,498
- What are you doing here?
- What am I gonna do?

947
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:05,632
Look, I've got this thing
under control, all right?

948
01:12:05,834 --> 01:12:08,200
Nicky, you promised.

949
01:12:08,737 --> 01:12:10,796
- You didn't have to come in here.
- What am I gonna do?

950
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:13,106
- You promised.
- Stop saying I promised you.

951
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:15,674
- Why do you have to come here?
- Don't leave me by myself.

952
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:17,811
I'm not leaving you by yourself.

953
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:19,776
You're gonna be okay.

954
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:26,014
Women.

955
01:12:41,603 --> 01:12:43,127
Thank you.

956
01:12:49,611 --> 01:12:50,976
What's the matter with that girl?

957
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,409
- Oh, nothing.
- Hopper.

958
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,142
I gotta go.

959
01:12:57,352 --> 01:12:59,513
You look real pretty.

960
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,128
I'll do it.

961
01:13:38,827 --> 01:13:40,795
They're too big.

962
01:13:41,196 --> 01:13:43,130
What do you mean, they're too big?

963
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:45,562
You're gonna shoot pool with them,
not wrestle them.

964
01:13:45,767 --> 01:13:47,792
I'm thinking about after
I shoot pool with them

965
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:50,471
and they figure out they been hustled.

966
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,697
And they will figure it out.

967
01:13:52,908 --> 01:13:54,432
They're just a couple
stupid uniforms.

968
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:57,271
Besides, there's a fire exit
right over there.

969
01:13:58,413 --> 01:14:00,210
Just in case.

970
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:12,859
Afternoon, gents.

971
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:15,928
Someone said one of you
was looking for a game.

972
01:14:16,131 --> 01:14:17,758
Someone said wrong.

973
01:14:17,966 --> 01:14:19,456
That's what I thought.
He must be wrong,

974
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:23,502
because I never knew any Navy boy
who had the skill to play for money.

975
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:26,936
It's all that time on ships,
does something to their balance.

976
01:14:27,142 --> 01:14:28,507
There's nothing wrong
with my balance.

977
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:31,474
No, of course not.
Don't let me hold up your game.

978
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:40,614
That's a tough break.

979
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:42,653
Wanna play? I'll play you.

980
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:44,553
No, not me. I got a bad wrist.

981
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,387
But my friend will play.

982
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:55,160
How about it?

983
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:58,271
- Sure.
- Great.

984
01:15:00,642 --> 01:15:02,576
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bill.

985
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:07,977
Glad to meet you, Bill.
I'm Bud... and that's Lou.

986
01:15:08,183 --> 01:15:11,380
Now that we're all friends,
let's get down to some business.

987
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:19,683
How's 5 dollars sound?

988
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,193
Yeah, that sounds okay.

989
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:24,159
Eight-ball's the game.

990
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,300
You do know how to play
eight-ball, don't you, Bill?

991
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:28,896
I know how.

992
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,399
Terrific.

993
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:39,147
Eight in the corner.

994
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:40,979
That's 20 bucks you owe me, sport.

995
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,980
No, no, no. Now, William...

996
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,210
...not so fast. My boy,
he's just warming up.

997
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,287
How about if we make things
a little more interesting?

998
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:52,153
How about if we see
some green on the table?

999
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:54,928
Does this answer your question?

1000
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,688
Nobody touches my money!

1001
01:15:56,898 --> 01:15:59,162
- Some of that money's mine.
- Not yet, it ain't.

1002
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:01,597
Ten bucks a game, all right?

1003
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,335
Oh, shit.

1004
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:09,572
Nicky, let's get out of here, right now.

1005
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:10,904
Would you relax?

1006
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:12,704
This is perfect.

1007
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:17,445
Excuse me, boys.

1008
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:20,417
We've got a little contest
going on here.

1009
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,750
And I thought you might be interested
in a little action.

1010
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:27,156
What kind of action?

1011
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,127
Well, it just so happens

1012
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:33,427
that yesterday morning, I sold my car.

1013
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:37,071
A dandy little 1932 Plymouth.

1014
01:16:37,372 --> 01:16:39,567
It's all here, 150 bucks.

1015
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:43,108
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Now, William, I'm sure you don't.

1016
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:45,404
But maybe your shipmates do.
How about it, guys?

1017
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:48,139
You willing to back your buddy?
He is really on a roll.

1018
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,577
- How much you got?
- Wait a minute, guys!

1019
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:52,217
That's a lot of money.

1020
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,717
What's the matter, William?

1021
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:55,890
Are you losing your nerve?

1022
01:16:57,425 --> 01:16:59,222
- I got 40.
- I got 60.

1023
01:17:01,963 --> 01:17:04,056
Hundred and fifty bucks, straight pool.

1024
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:05,494
First one to a hundred.

1025
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,864
Is that okay with you, Bud,
or was it Lou?

1026
01:17:10,071 --> 01:17:12,403
- Call it.
- Heads.

1027
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:15,472
Tails. You break.

1028
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:22,115
Fourteen in the corner.

1029
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:27,146
Two, corner.

1030
01:17:32,928 --> 01:17:35,419
Five, cross corner.

1031
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,537
- So?
- Seven in the side.

1032
01:17:42,737 --> 01:17:44,295
- He's good.
- How good?

1033
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:46,599
- Thirteen in the corner.
- A lot better than he was

1034
01:17:46,808 --> 01:17:47,832
five minutes ago.

1035
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:50,435
Four in the corner.

1036
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:54,047
Twelve in the corner.

1037
01:17:54,649 --> 01:17:56,480
Three in the side.

1038
01:17:57,118 --> 01:17:58,915
Rack them.

1039
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:11,023
Two in the corner.
Thirteen in the side.

1040
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,495
Four in the side.

1041
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:16,034
Twelve in the corner.

1042
01:18:18,974 --> 01:18:21,272
Fifteen in the side.

1043
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:25,843
Eight in the corner.

1044
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:28,346
Three in the corner.

1045
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:33,687
Rack them.

1046
01:18:44,799 --> 01:18:46,460
Ten in the corner.

1047
01:19:03,151 --> 01:19:04,778
Eight, corner.

1048
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:08,388
Five in the corner.

1049
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,721
Fifteen in the side.

1050
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:18,825
Eleven in the corner.

1051
01:19:21,403 --> 01:19:23,132
Rack them.

1052
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,442
One in the corner.

1053
01:19:45,093 --> 01:19:46,993
Twelve in the corner.

1054
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:55,234
Five in the corner.
Nine in the corner.

1055
01:19:58,606 --> 01:20:00,096
Fourteen in the corner.

1056
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:03,166
Rack them.

1057
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:47,988
Six, corner.

1058
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:56,856
Seven, corner.

1059
01:20:57,766 --> 01:20:59,028
Ten, corner.

1060
01:21:06,608 --> 01:21:08,633
Fourteen in the corner.

1061
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:14,103
Oh, eat Martian head, you're dead!

1062
01:21:17,685 --> 01:21:19,915
Two more points!

1063
01:21:22,056 --> 01:21:24,024
What's wrong?

1064
01:21:24,225 --> 01:21:26,125
I don't have a shot.

1065
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:34,895
Well, what are you gonna do?

1066
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:37,663
Make sure he doesn't have one either.

1067
01:22:01,462 --> 01:22:03,327
Three in the corner.

1068
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:06,591
Oh, no, he can't make that, right?

1069
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:08,527
Right?

1070
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,036
- One more.
- Seven in the side.

1071
01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:22,842
That's the one we want.

1072
01:22:24,352 --> 01:22:26,684
Well, fair is fair, boys.

1073
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:28,822
We'll just be running along.

1074
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:33,524
- You don't mind if we count it, do you?
- Count it.

1075
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,959
It's not that we don't trust you.

1076
01:22:58,586 --> 01:23:00,451
Bad idea, boys.

1077
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:02,316
There seems to be
some kind of mix-up here.

1078
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:03,888
Hopper, you know
anything about this?

1079
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:05,059
What are you doing?

1080
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:10,357
I know for a fact that when we walked
into this establishment and...

1081
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:12,196
Shit.

1082
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:14,001
Duck, Hopper!

1083
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:28,681
Run.

1084
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,914
Go!

1085
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:39,258
- What the hell's wrong?
- Sometimes it takes time...

1086
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,722
If you don't get this car started,

1087
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:43,523
my dad's gonna have two more
holes to dig tomorrow. Let's go!

1088
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,340
It's about time. What the hell
happened to you two?

1089
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:33,946
Never mind, just get cleaned up.

1090
01:24:34,148 --> 01:24:36,343
You know what trouble
your mother's gone to?

1091
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:39,782
You'd think you could be on time
for your own birthday, Henry.

1092
01:24:39,988 --> 01:24:41,353
- What happened?
- We had a run-in

1093
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:44,150
- with the U.S. Navy.
- What? Where?

1094
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:45,326
Up north.

1095
01:24:45,526 --> 01:24:48,256
- What were you doing up north?
- Playing pool.

1096
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:50,397
- Actually, it was more like hustling pool.
- Nicky!

1097
01:24:50,598 --> 01:24:51,758
We needed money. A lot of money.

1098
01:24:51,966 --> 01:24:53,957
- Knock it off.
- What?!

1099
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,465
- I know what you're doing.
- We're leaving here in a week.

1100
01:24:58,673 --> 01:24:59,731
- No.
- She's our last chance.

1101
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:01,306
- Shut up!
- What am I supposed to do,

1102
01:25:01,509 --> 01:25:02,601
leave Sally here pregnant?

1103
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,243
You son of a bitch!

1104
01:25:04,946 --> 01:25:05,913
What's going on?

1105
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:08,674
Damn it, Caddie, I need $150!

1106
01:25:08,883 --> 01:25:11,374
You got some mouth, you know that?

1107
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:16,355
I told you boys to get ready.
Come on now, speed it up.

1108
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:25,122
Henry, what's the matter?

1109
01:25:32,273 --> 01:25:33,604
Will you sit down, Caddie?

1110
01:25:45,653 --> 01:25:48,121
Caddie, this is very hard for me.

1111
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:57,654
The way I been raised, these
people just don't ask for things.

1112
01:26:02,603 --> 01:26:04,127
See...

1113
01:26:06,174 --> 01:26:08,335
...that girl you saw last night...

1114
01:26:08,543 --> 01:26:10,841
...Nicky got her pregnant.

1115
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,341
And we gotta get her an abortion.

1116
01:26:14,882 --> 01:26:19,182
A clean abortion costs $150.

1117
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:21,753
Nicky and I don't have
that kind of money.

1118
01:26:23,257 --> 01:26:25,157
You know what I'm saying?

1119
01:26:26,794 --> 01:26:28,284
I'm not sure.

1120
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:36,834
Caddie...

1121
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,404
...can you get us the money?

1122
01:26:39,607 --> 01:26:43,976
It's $150, and I'll make sure
you get every bit of it back.

1123
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:51,782
I'll see what I can do.

1124
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,451
Caddie, what are you doing here?

1125
01:27:37,498 --> 01:27:39,966
Why do you have my necklace?

1126
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:42,859
You should have asked first.

1127
01:27:44,672 --> 01:27:47,505
Relax. It... It's okay, really.

1128
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:49,801
Do you want to try it on?

1129
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:51,871
Come on.

1130
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:56,206
- Oh, no. I couldn't.
- Caddie.

1131
01:27:56,417 --> 01:27:57,679
What is the matter with you?

1132
01:27:57,885 --> 01:27:59,614
L... I want to go downstairs, I think.

1133
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,084
Why are you so nervous?

1134
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:04,520
Alice, I didn't come in here to try it on.

1135
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:05,749
What are you talking about?

1136
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,984
I came because I need money,

1137
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:09,095
and the necklace is the only way
I could think of.

1138
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:12,556
I don't understand. Why would
you do something like that?

1139
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:15,468
Caddie, are you in trouble?

1140
01:28:16,103 --> 01:28:19,231
Oh, Alice. Alice.

1141
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:23,471
I've made such a mess of things.

1142
01:28:23,844 --> 01:28:25,607
There is somebody who needs
something from me,

1143
01:28:25,813 --> 01:28:26,905
and he thinks I'm special,

1144
01:28:27,114 --> 01:28:29,582
and I just wanna give it to him.

1145
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:32,685
I almost did a horrible thing,

1146
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:36,584
but it's only because
I don't wanna let him down.

1147
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,696
I wonder what it would be like
to be you sometimes.

1148
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:47,031
I mean...

1149
01:28:48,402 --> 01:28:52,202
...I look around here, and everything
seems so much easier for you.

1150
01:28:53,674 --> 01:28:55,904
Not so much.

1151
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,941
I'll get you the money.

1152
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:12,842
I don't want you in there.

1153
01:30:37,044 --> 01:30:39,604
I guess they should be starting
in a few minutes.

1154
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:41,873
They say it doesn't take too long.

1155
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,813
There's another girl coming in at 11.

1156
01:30:45,186 --> 01:30:48,781
Boy, 150 bucks a shot,
that's some business, huh?

1157
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:51,253
You should go in there
and hold her hand, Nicky.

1158
01:30:51,459 --> 01:30:53,893
She doesn't want me in there.

1159
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:36,533
Oh, I'm sick.

1160
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:15,560
<i>- the exact location
from which I'm speaking.</i>

1161
01:33:15,769 --> 01:33:17,896
<i>Off to my left, far away
in the distance,</i>

1162
01:33:18,105 --> 01:33:20,767
<i>I can see just that faint, red,
angry snap</i>

1163
01:33:20,975 --> 01:33:25,776
<i>of antiaircraft bursts
against a steel-blue sky.</i>

1164
01:33:38,959 --> 01:33:41,086
- Nicky.
- Huh?

1165
01:33:41,295 --> 01:33:43,661
- Will you stop, please?
- Huh?

1166
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:45,798
Will you stop, please?
Stop the car, please?

1167
01:33:46,033 --> 01:33:47,728
- What's the matter, Caddie?
- I wanna get out.

1168
01:33:47,935 --> 01:33:50,233
Cad, it's only a few more blocks.

1169
01:33:50,437 --> 01:33:52,735
Would you stop the damn car?!

1170
01:34:00,981 --> 01:34:04,109
- Cad. Caddie, where you going?
- Home.

1171
01:34:04,318 --> 01:34:07,287
- I'll walk you.
- No, I don't want you to walk me.

1172
01:34:07,488 --> 01:34:09,149
I know what you're thinking.

1173
01:34:09,356 --> 01:34:12,189
You're thinking that could've been you
in there. Well, you're wrong, Caddie.

1174
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:14,987
I'd never take you to a place
like that, I'd marry you.

1175
01:34:15,195 --> 01:34:17,288
Did you hear what I said?
I'd marry you.

1176
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:20,990
Oh, well, what makes you think
I'd marry you?

1177
01:34:21,635 --> 01:34:23,000
- Get back in the car.
- No.

1178
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:25,034
- Get back in the goddamn car.
- Let go of my arm.

1179
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:26,433
Oh, I'm sorry.

1180
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:30,272
I didn't know you were gonna
end up running into that place.

1181
01:34:32,212 --> 01:34:34,180
What do you want from me?

1182
01:34:35,282 --> 01:34:37,443
I don't want anything from you.

1183
01:34:37,851 --> 01:34:40,376
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1184
01:34:41,088 --> 01:34:43,022
It's the money, right?

1185
01:34:44,358 --> 01:34:46,918
You think I took advantage of you
because I asked you for that money.

1186
01:34:47,127 --> 01:34:50,460
Well, Caddie, we needed that money,
and you're the only rich person I know.

1187
01:34:51,332 --> 01:34:53,960
You are such an idiot.

1188
01:34:54,168 --> 01:34:56,636
I'm not rich.

1189
01:34:56,837 --> 01:35:00,136
- What?
- I'm not rich.

1190
01:35:00,341 --> 01:35:01,808
What are you talking about?

1191
01:35:02,009 --> 01:35:05,137
Yes, I live in that house on the hill.
Do you know why I live in that house?

1192
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:07,109
Because my mother
works in that house.

1193
01:35:07,314 --> 01:35:08,838
My mom is a maid.

1194
01:35:09,049 --> 01:35:10,949
She's a maid in that house.

1195
01:35:11,151 --> 01:35:13,244
Goddamn you!

1196
01:35:13,454 --> 01:35:15,684
I tried to tell you
about a million times.

1197
01:35:15,889 --> 01:35:19,222
But you are so pleased
with your little girl on the hill

1198
01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:22,327
that I didn't wanna disappoint you.

1199
01:35:31,672 --> 01:35:33,299
Just leave me alone.

1200
01:35:33,507 --> 01:35:35,498
Leave me alone.

1201
01:35:42,383 --> 01:35:44,112
Hop, you coming?

1202
01:35:44,985 --> 01:35:46,452
Hop.

1203
01:36:01,035 --> 01:36:02,297
What are you doing?

1204
01:36:02,503 --> 01:36:06,030
This is my old man's car,
you crazy son of a bitch.

1205
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,639
What the hell's the matter with you?

1206
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,741
You, Nicky, you're
what's the matter with me.

1207
01:36:09,943 --> 01:36:11,308
You're always making your life
a mess,

1208
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:12,979
and I'm always getting you out of it.

1209
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:15,410
- Hey, it's over. It's all fixed.
- Shut up. Shut up.

1210
01:36:16,684 --> 01:36:18,982
Sally could've died tonight, Nicky.
That ever cross your mind?

1211
01:36:19,186 --> 01:36:21,279
But she didn't.

1212
01:36:22,656 --> 01:36:25,557
Jesus, you just don't get it, do you?

1213
01:36:26,026 --> 01:36:28,392
And then you get her mixed up in it.

1214
01:36:31,865 --> 01:36:34,993
I'm sick of you messing up
my life, Nicky.

1215
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:38,197
I'm sick of it.

1216
01:36:43,877 --> 01:36:46,971
You didn't even open the door
for her, Nicky.

1217
01:36:48,215 --> 01:36:49,409
Girl just had an abortion,

1218
01:36:49,616 --> 01:36:52,813
you can't even get out of the car
and open the door for her.

1219
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:24,474
Damn cold for February.

1220
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:25,811
Laid a bed of these last night.

1221
01:37:26,019 --> 01:37:28,214
This morning, the ground
was still like rock.

1222
01:37:28,422 --> 01:37:30,219
I don't know what it is.

1223
01:37:31,825 --> 01:37:35,659
Your mom says Nicky's been by
the house three times this past week.

1224
01:37:39,466 --> 01:37:41,559
Well, you know your own mind.

1225
01:37:41,769 --> 01:37:45,205
Just seems you two could use
each other's company about now.

1226
01:37:49,309 --> 01:37:51,675
You know, for a time,
right after his mom died,

1227
01:37:51,879 --> 01:37:54,347
Nicky brought flowers here
every day.

1228
01:37:54,548 --> 01:37:56,948
Come after school, just sit there.

1229
01:37:57,151 --> 01:38:00,518
Be so tired, I'd have to carry him
home on my shoulders.

1230
01:38:01,522 --> 01:38:02,648
Did you know that?

1231
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,450
Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.

1232
01:38:16,737 --> 01:38:19,365
Damn cold for February.

1233
01:38:19,573 --> 01:38:20,972
Yeah.

1234
01:39:10,858 --> 01:39:12,553
How you doing?

1235
01:39:14,194 --> 01:39:17,186
- Okay. You?
- Okay.

1236
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,797
- Thursday's the big day, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1237
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:27,996
You ready?

1238
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:29,971
- You bet.
- Me too.

1239
01:39:35,515 --> 01:39:38,643
- I went by and I saw Sally.
- Yeah?

1240
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:42,646
Just to see how she was doing
and everything, you know.

1241
01:39:42,856 --> 01:39:44,585
- How is she?
- She's good.

1242
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:46,281
That's good.

1243
01:39:49,596 --> 01:39:52,394
You know what she said to me
just before I left?

1244
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,731
She said,
"Take care of yourself, Nick. "

1245
01:39:57,671 --> 01:39:59,502
Can you beat that?

1246
01:40:11,718 --> 01:40:14,209
We gotta stick together, Nicky.

1247
01:40:15,188 --> 01:40:17,179
We gotta stick together.

1248
01:40:21,094 --> 01:40:22,493
Yeah.

1249
01:40:25,332 --> 01:40:26,822
Yeah.

1250
01:42:08,435 --> 01:42:10,562
Why don't you try them on.

1251
01:42:30,323 --> 01:42:32,484
I already know they fit.

1252
01:42:49,142 --> 01:42:51,110
I love you, Caddie.

1253
01:42:53,213 --> 01:42:55,408
I love you, Henry.

1254
01:43:33,153 --> 01:43:34,552
Don't cry, Mom.

1255
01:43:34,754 --> 01:43:36,278
I'm not crying.

1256
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:38,754
You come back and play for me.

1257
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:40,551
Board!

1258
01:43:44,898 --> 01:43:47,594
- Keep your eyes peeled.
- I will, Dad.

1259
01:43:50,504 --> 01:43:53,268
- You too, Nicky.
- I will, sir.

1260
01:43:55,609 --> 01:43:56,667
Take care.

1261
01:43:58,778 --> 01:44:01,338
I brought something for you.

1262
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:06,210
It's for your wallet.

1263
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:12,651
All aboard.

1264
01:44:21,735 --> 01:44:23,134
Board.

1265
01:44:23,336 --> 01:44:25,201
You boys better be getting on.

1266
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:32,339
Be safe.

1267
01:44:40,654 --> 01:44:44,249
- Son, your train is leaving.
- What's the matter with him?

1268
01:44:44,457 --> 01:44:45,822
Henry? Henry.

1269
01:44:46,026 --> 01:44:48,426
Your train. Your train!

1270
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:52,760
Henry. Henry.

1271
01:44:52,966 --> 01:44:55,901
- Henry.
- Son, your train.

1272
01:44:56,102 --> 01:44:57,592
- Henry.
- Nicky.

1273
01:44:58,205 --> 01:45:00,230
- Henry.
- What's the matter?

1274
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,635
- Ready, buddy?
- Ready.
