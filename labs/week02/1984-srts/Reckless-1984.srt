we held the Falcons

So, uh, where have
you been, Rourke?

Out signing autographs, or
just practicing a few new steps?

00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,489
You want to get up,
show us a turn or two.

Let us pray.

1111
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,679
"With faith in Jesus Christ

1112
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,637
we reverently bring the body
of our brother

1113
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,466
to be buried in it's human imperfection.

1114
01:16:41,553 --> 01:16:43,250
Let us pray with confidence to God

1115
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,601
who gives life to all things.

1116
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:48,168
May we raise up this
mortal body to the perfection

1117
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,301
and company of the saints.

1118
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:52,477
May God give him
a merciful judgment

1119
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:54,740
and forgive all his sins.

1120
01:16:54,827 --> 01:16:57,874

lead him safely home

1121
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,528
to be at peace with God, our father.

1122
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,530

And we bid our last farewell.

There is sadness in the parting

1128
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,413
but it should fill us with new hope.

1129
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,937
And one day, we shall
see our brother again.

1130
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:19,809
And enjoy his love.

we who leave this cemetery today in sorrow

1133
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:27,686
will be reunited in the
joy of God's kingdom.

So, as you can see, it's no party.

1163
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:32,920
We're not sending out invitations.

1164
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,835
We're issuing a challenge.

1165

your country's future,
the future of freedom.

1167
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:43,453
Does it scare you?
It ought to.

1168
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,151
But if it doesn't...

1169
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,327
...maybe, just maybe...

1170
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:50,460

Yeah.

1187
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,256
Now, listen, Tracey.

1188
01:24:47,343 --> 01:24:50,041
I know I don't have any rights
over you and I would...

1189
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,564
...I could never force you

1190
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:54,176
to do anything you didn't want.

1191
01:24:54,263 --> 01:24:56,700
But there's something I gotta do.

1192
01:24:56,787 --> 01:24:58,528
I gotta go.

1193
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,399
I don't know where.

1194
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:02,793
Just somewhere different.

1195
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,099
And I gotta go now.

1196
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:08,233
'Cause

1197
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,452
you see...

1198
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,412
...I get real frustrated
'cause there's lot of stuff

1199
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:16,459
that I feel and that I wanna say

1200
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:19,157
but it just don't come out right.

1201
01:25:21,028 --> 01:25:23,901
So, I get real pissed off

1202
01:25:23,988 --> 01:25:26,904
and start smashing into
things and hurtin' 'em.

1203
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:34,477
See...

1204
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:37,958
...I didn't want to hurt you

1205
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,357
I just want you.

1206
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:47,011
You want?

1207
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:51,189
Need.

1208
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:57,021
I need you to come with me.

1209
01:25:57,108 --> 01:25:58,979
And do everything with me.

1210
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:00,894
And then feel
everything with me.

1211
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:04,159
It's just not good alone.

1212
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:11,470
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1213
01:26:15,474 --> 01:26:19,086
You know, I'm so tired
of your fucking bullshit act.

1214
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,827
Randy, can you just leave us
alone for a minute?

1215
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,568
No, this has nothing to do with you.

1216
01:26:22,655 --> 01:26:23,917
This is between me and him.

1217
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:25,571
There's nothing between me and you.

1218
01:26:25,658 --> 01:26:27,225
There sure as shit is.

1219
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,574
There's you pissin' me off

1220
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:30,097
and there's me not takin' it anymore.

1221
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:31,621
Randy, don't.

1222
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,666
Why the fuck not?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

1223
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:35,320
I ain't gonna fight.

1224
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,714
Randy, come on.
His father just died.

1225
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:40,238
Yeah, he was so drunk,
he fell right in with the slag.

[Bob Seger singing "Roll Me Away"]

1253
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:35,135
РЎф Stood alone on a mountain top РЎф

1254
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:37,312
РЎф Starin' out at the great divide РЎф

1255
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:42,752
РЎф I could go east I could go west РЎф

1256
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:45,842
РЎф It was all up to me to decide РЎф

1257
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:50,063
РЎф Just then I saw a young hawk flyin' РЎф

1258
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:52,762
РЎф And my soul began to rise РЎф

1259
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:56,679
РЎф And pretty soon РЎф

1260
01:28:59,812 --> 01:29:02,424
РЎф My heart was singin' РЎф

1261
01:29:02,511 --> 01:29:04,600
РЎф Roll roll me away РЎф

1262
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:07,080
РЎф Won't you roll me away tonight РЎф

1263
01:29:08,908 --> 01:29:11,607
РЎф I too am lost I feel double-crossed РЎф

1264
01:29:11,694 --> 01:29:14,740
РЎф And I'm sick of what is
wrong and what is right РЎф

1265
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:18,483
РЎф We never even said a word РЎф

1266
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:21,181
РЎф We just walked out
and got on that bike РЎф

1267
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:25,925
РЎф And we rolled РЎф

1268
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:31,278
РЎф And we rolled clean out of sight РЎф

1269
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:48,992
РЎф We rolled across the high plains РЎф

1270
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,343
РЎф Deep into the mountains РЎф

1271
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:56,042
РЎф Felt so good to me РЎф

1272
01:29:56,129 --> 01:29:59,394
РЎф Finally feelin' free РЎф

1273
01:29:59,481 --> 01:30:03,310
РЎф Somewhere along a high road РЎф

1274
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,879
РЎф The air began to turn cold РЎф

1275
01:30:06,966 --> 01:30:09,316
РЎф She said
she missed her home РЎф

1276
01:30:10,622 --> 01:30:12,885
РЎф I headed on alone РЎф

1277
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:16,280
РЎф O-oh РЎф

1278
01:30:43,002 --> 01:30:44,917
РЎф Roll me away РЎф

1279
01:30:49,966 --> 01:30:52,229
РЎф Roll me away РЎф

1280
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,417
РЎф Roll me away РЎф

[Romeo Void singing "Never Say Never"]

1282
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:31,921
РЎф If time itself was his demeanor РЎф

1283
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:35,315
РЎф There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer РЎф

1284
01:31:35,402 --> 01:31:38,405
РЎф Of sunlight landing on the street РЎф

1285
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,104
РЎф Sunsuit girls must be discreet РЎф

1286
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:50,330
РЎф Sunsuit girls must be discreet РЎф

1287
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:53,203
РЎф Nursing their fathers locked inside РЎф

1288
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:57,120
РЎф They masqueraded as his bride РЎф

1289
01:32:02,778 --> 01:32:05,868
РЎф I might like you better
if we slept together РЎф

1290
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:08,871
РЎф I might like you better
if we slept together РЎф

1291
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:11,656
РЎф I might like you better
if we slept together РЎф

1292
01:32:11,743 --> 01:32:14,659
РЎф But there's something
in your eyes that says maybe РЎф

1293
01:32:14,746 --> 01:32:16,661
РЎф That's never РЎф

1294
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:19,359
РЎф Never say never РЎф

1295
01:32:32,634 --> 01:32:35,985
РЎф There's no easy way РЎф

1296
01:32:36,072 --> 01:32:38,553
РЎф To lose your sight РЎф

1297
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,643
РЎф On the street on the stairs РЎф

1298
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:45,081
РЎф Who's on your flight РЎф

1299
01:32:45,168 --> 01:32:48,127
РЎф Old couple walks by РЎф

1300
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:50,565
РЎф As ugly as sin РЎф

1301
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:54,307
РЎф But he's got her РЎф

1302
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:57,267
РЎф She's got him РЎф

1303
01:33:10,062 --> 01:33:12,935
РЎф Never say never РЎф

1304
01:33:13,022 --> 01:33:16,025
РЎф Never say never РЎф

1305
01:33:16,112 --> 01:33:19,506
РЎф Never say never РЎф

1306
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,769
РЎф Never never РЎф
