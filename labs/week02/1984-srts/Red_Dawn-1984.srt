
1
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,100
We“ve got Yankee tanks coming
in from the plains.

2
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
We“ve lost most of our night vision

3
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,700
and have only
a few anti-tank missiles left.

4
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Put your best men
into hunter groups armed with RPG“s.

5
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,800
Have your men
dig holes 100 meters apart.

6
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,700
Wait until the Yankees approach
to strike then attack them in force.

7
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,300
Yes, Colonel Bella.

8
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
I want some anti-aircraft here.

9
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,900
We“re working on it, sir.

10
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
This. . .this is a madhouse!

11
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you want to see me?

12
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,500
Yes. . .yes.

13
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,100
Go to the sporting goods store.

14
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,700
From the files, obtain form 4473.

15
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
These will contain descriptions
of weapons

16
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and lists of private ownership.

17
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, how beautiful.

18
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,100
What is written here?

19
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
You studied English.

20
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Translate.

21
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,300
American history. . .I know this well.

22
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,700
Arapaho National Battlefield.

23
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,100
Here was a great peasant uprising
in 1908 of wild Indians.

24
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,300
They were crushed
by President Theodore Roosevelt

25
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,500
leading imperialist armies and cowboys.

26
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,600
The battle lasted all winter.

27
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,200
More than 35,000 were killed.

28
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,000
It was the greatest battle
of the American West.

29
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,200
Bravo!

30
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,200
Yuri, stay here.

31
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
I“ll take a photo of you.

32
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,300
African baboon.

33
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,200
Now you.

34
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,800
Come here, my friend.

35
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,900
Hurry up, you fool.

36
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,500
Look at me, Yuri.

37
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
Look.

38
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,100
Look what I“ve found.

39
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
An arrow.

40
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,900
And Indian arrow.

41
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
What a philosopher you are.

42
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,400
I did not know the Indians used steel.

43
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,600
Sure, you fool,

44
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,100
they used the melted sabers
of Federalist Cossacks.

45
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,100
Did these Indians work in plastic, too?

46
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,500
You idiot, this is bone,
polished to a high sheen.

47
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,200
There must be more.

48
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,500
Look.

49
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Watch out!

50
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,300
She has a weapon.

51
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,200
Stop, damn it!

52
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,500
Quickly. . .catch him!

53
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,500
Stop!

54
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
Help me, comrades.

55
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,500
I“m dying.

56
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
God help me!

57
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,800
God help me!

58
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:06,900
From now on all troops are forbidden
to travel outside secured areas

59
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,800
in any group smaller than squad size.

60
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes Colonel Bella.

61
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,300
Then call Bratchenko.

62
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,300
Tell him Sector Eight is now active.

63
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,800
Right away, Colonel Bella.

64
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And I want some interrogations made 

65
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
starting with the Mayor.

66
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
I“m sick of his...

67
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
...pleasantries.

68
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,400
Consider it done.

69
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,900
Take gasoline.

70
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,700
Hey, girl, what are you doing here?

71
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,300
Hey, beautiful, where are you going?

72
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,600
Forget the broad, just get her stuff.

73
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,700
Where are you going?

74
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,700
You“re so beautiful.

75
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,400
What, what“s wrong with you?

76
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,000
Let“s get her!

77
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,800
It“s cut. . .it“s cut!

78
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,100
I“ve seen this before.

79
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:01,500
Nicaragua, San Salvador Cambodia,
Angola, and Mexico.

80
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,100
But these are my men!

81
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,700
What is a ““Wolverine““?

82
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,200
A small animal. . .like a badger,
but terribly ferocious.

83
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,350
It is also the name
of the local school sports collective.

84
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,500
They“re beasts, Ernesto.

85
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,300
You must kill every one
of them eventually.

86
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,200
It“s the same as Afghanistan.

87
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,900
They“ll never stop.

88
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,300
Look. . .I was always on the side
of the insurgents.

89
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,900
I have no experience in these matters.

90
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,600
But it would seem necessary
to win the support of the people.

91
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,500
As our opponents used
to say in Vietnam““

92
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,900
““Win their hearts and minds.““

93
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,300
And they lost, Ernesto.

94
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,400
Of course, General.

95
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Things are paralyzed at the front,
Ernesto.

96
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,900
Morale is crucial right now.

97
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,700
Keep the men in the secured areas.

98
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,000
You“ll see how they forget
about these ““Molverines““.

99
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,900
Are you all right?

100
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,600
You were saying, comrade?

101
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,600
Shut up!

102
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,100
Help. . .

103
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,400
The ``Wolverines`` . . .

104
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,300
. . . are attacking.

105
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,000
Follow me. . .quickly.

106
01:05:05,285 --> 01:05:07,253
Children did this?
                            
107
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:09,387
It`s rebels.
                            
108
01:05:09,556 --> 01:05:11,023
What rebels?
                            
109
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:12,749
They`re bandits!
                            
110
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:19,323
Every time they shoot,
the revolution grows.
                            
111
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,295
I know.
                            
112
01:05:20,467 --> 01:05:21,900
I was a partisan.
                            
113
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:26,299
And what are you now?
                            
114
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:29,569
Now I`m like you 

115
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,400
a policeman.

116
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:15,480
Attention!

117
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:28,853
Be seated, comrades.

118
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:40,771
What I despise most about warfare
is the hypocrisy it often breeds.

119
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:44,643
I`ve heard euphemisms
that we are containing the enemy

120
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:48,679
that our sector
of pacification is growing.

121
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:51,947
These are the tactics of the lie.

122
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:55,479
Lies have the stench
of death and defeat.

123
01:17:58,357 --> 01:18:04,489
You can only win a war by exterminating
the enemy.

124
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:08,723
Do you know who we are fighting?

125
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:14,000
We are fighting Wolverines.

126
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,500
Small, ferocious animals.

127
01:18:19,512 --> 01:18:22,140
For them, you need a hunter.

128
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:27,445
And you know. . .I am a hunter.

129
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:34,484
From this moment on there

130
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:39,495
will be no further reprisals
against civilians.

131
01:18:39,665 --> 01:18:41,724
This was stupid.

132
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,396
Impotence.

133
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:51,208
Comrades

134
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:55,670
If a fox stole your chickens

135
01:18:55,848 --> 01:19:00,683
would you slaughter your pig
because he saw the fox?

136
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,622
No.

137
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:10,654
You would hunt the fox find where
it lives and destroy it!

138
01:19:12,798 --> 01:19:16,393
And how do we do this?

139
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,103
Become a fox.

140
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:42,761
Comrade Colonel.

141
01:38:47,202 --> 01:38:51,276
I would estimate
the enemy body count at. . . 

142
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:54,108
12. . .

143
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,072
Wouldn`t you agree?

144
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:00,111
12?

145
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:02,414
12?

146
01:39:06,591 --> 01:39:10,049
I saw only one.

147
01:39:13,098 --> 01:39:15,293
But they carry off their dead.

148
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,328
Of course, why not?

149
01:39:21,306 --> 01:39:23,240
What do you think?

150
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:33,658
I can`t remember what it was to be warm

151
01:42:34,933 --> 01:42:40,428
It seems a thousand years since
I was a small boy in the sun.

152
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:45,167
How did I come to this high,

153
01:42:46,477 --> 01:42:54,384
desolate place where there is nothing
but loneliness?

154
01:42:55,219 --> 01:42:57,380
So much is lost.

155
01:42:57,588 --> 01:43:04,687
I want to look into your eyes
and forget.

156
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:10,565
It all seems so far away a warm house
where my shadow never falls your long,

157
01:43:10,735 --> 01:43:14,728
black hair in my hands.

158
01:43:17,842 --> 01:43:24,042
There is no more revolution
only you to come back to.

159
01:43:24,682 --> 01:43:28,914
I will post my resignation.

160
01:44:51,836 --> 01:44:57,536
They`re attacking the station.

161
01:45:27,605 --> 01:45:32,838
Everybody to the station.

162
01:46:02,306 --> 01:46:04,433
Hurry, hurry!

163
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:36,666
