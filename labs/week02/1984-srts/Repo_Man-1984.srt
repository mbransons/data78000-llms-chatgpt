1
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:40,290
Let me see your driver's license.

2
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,505
From out of town?

3
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:53,762
What you got in the trunk?
- You don't want to look in there.

4
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,393
Give me the keys!

5
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:09,921
Kevin, stop singing.
- I wasn't singing.

6
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:14,051
I'm right next to you,
and you're singing. Cut it out!

7
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,972
Why so tense?
- Otto! - Mr. Humphries!

8
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,810
You were late again this morning.
Normally, I'd let it go,

9
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:28,982
but it's been brought to my attention,
you're not stacking cans properly.

10
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,320
Many young men of your age,
in these uncertain times...

11
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,699
Otto! Are you paying attention?

12
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,912
He's talking to you!

13
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:45,040
Fuck you!

14
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:55,133
Good Lord!

15
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,594
Come on, just try it!

16
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:02,516
Come on! - You gotta love
getting fired in a big way, Otto!

17
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,684
What are you laughing at?

18
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,063
Louie, throw him out too.
- Come on, you worm!

19
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,856
Get out of here!

20
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:35,924
How you doing, dude?
When did you get out of the slammer?

21
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,518
Excuse me while
I fold my pants.

22
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,064
What's the difference?

23
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:17,132
Otto! - What?
- Get me another beer.

24
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:28,852
Cool. Ow, dammit. A joke's a joke,
but I'm supposed to be the host!

25
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,568
Debbi, honey, I got your beer.

26
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:41,948
Shit.

27
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:47,829
Just ignore him, Duke,
he's just a big baby.

28
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,085
Turn the light out!
Hey, this is my parents' room!

29
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:58,548
Don't wanna talk about anything else.

30
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,803
We don't wanna know.

31
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:11,352
We're just dedicated

32
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,606
to our favorite shows:

33
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,401
"Saturday Night Live",

34
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:20,653
"Monday Night Football",

35
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,282
"Dallas", "Jeffersons",

36
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,535
Gilligan's Island,
"Flintstones".

37
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,436
Hey kid! Hey!

38
00:08:57,273 --> 00:09:01,653
Are you hard of hearing? - What?
- You want to make 10 bucks?

39
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,573
Fuck you, queer!
- Wait, you got the wrong idea!

40
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,410
My old lady is real sick.
I got to get her to the hospital, OK?

41
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:13,373
So what? Take her there.
- I can't leave her car in this area.

42
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,751
I need some helpful soul
to drive it for me.

43
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:21,381
She's pregnant. Twins!
She could drop at any time.

44
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:27,554
How much do I get? - 15 bucks.
- Won't do it for less than 20.

45
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,681
25.

46
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:35,395
Follow me in my old lady's car.
It's right here. - All right.

47
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:41,609
Where is your old lady? - Never mind,
let's get out of this bad area.

48
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:43,611
Come on!

49
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:55,290
Dad, come quick,
a gringo's messing with your car!

50
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,437
Let's go!

51
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,572
Son of a bitch!
Give me my car back!

52
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,286
Bastard, I'll kill you!

53
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:34,013
You know damn straight what I mean.
It's right outside.

54
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,226
Took me two weeks to get this money.
- That ain't your car.

55
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:42,563
Don't let him lie to you.
- Shut up!

56
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,359
Do I have to go to your house and
shove your dog's head down the toilet?

57
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:49,695
Take it easy, sonnyboy.
- Shut up, rent-a-cop!

58
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:54,325
Best goddamned car on the lot.
- Damn right it is.

59
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,341
What's happening, mama, want a lift?
- No thanks.

60
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:14,136
With no Cadillac, you sleep in a tent.
- Shut up, Plettschner.

61
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,806
Bud, what street was that car on?

62
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:21,769
I don't know, some alley. Hey kid,
what street was the Cutlass on?

63
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:25,690
I don't know.
What happened to your old lady?

64
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:31,112
Old lady? Shit!
I forgot all about her.

65
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,781
She'll take the bus. She's a rock.

66
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,325
Come on in.

67
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,203
Marlene!

68
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,876
Got a name, kid?

69
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,587
It's Otto.

70
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,172
Auto parts?

71
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:53,259
Here, kid!

72
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:56,846
"Helping Hand".

73
00:12:57,263 --> 00:13:00,182
Got a driver's license, honey?
Let me see it.

74
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:06,230
Guess who told us where it was?
Your damned brother!

75
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:12,111
Are you really 21?
- Isn't that what it says?

76
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,196
Want some help with that beer, kid?

77
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,117
You're all repo men!
- What if we are?

78
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:35,801
You know, kid, usually when
someone pulls shit like that,

79
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:39,513
my first reaction
is to punch his fucking lights out.

80
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,308
But you know what?

81
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,727
You're all right!

82
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:50,399
Right, Lite? - Got any messages
for me, baby? - Here you go.

83
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:52,360
Cracks me up.

84
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,529
Somebody piss on the floor again?
- Maybe he's looking for a job.

85
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:59,992
Could be. What do you say, kid?
We're always looking for good men.

86
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:03,788
Screw that!
I ain't gonna be a repo man. No way!

87
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:06,624
Too late! You already are.

88
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,729
You find one in every car.

89
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,941
You'll see.

90
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,492
Years ago I saw five cows mutilated.
Legs sticking up in the air.

91
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:45,037
Their testicles were gone.

92
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:48,332
I think Canadian bacon
is better myself.

93
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,045
I've never seen the likes of that.

94
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:02,555
What could've done that to him?

95
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,224
Gasoline?

96
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:09,979
Napalm?
- It happens sometimes.

97
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:14,733
People just explode.
Natural causes. - What?

98
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,587
SUSPECT PRESENCE
ON WESTCOAST CONFIRMED.

99
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:37,006
LOCATE IMMEDIATLY, NO POLICE.

100
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,634
Night watchman in Pomona.

101
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,096
Asbestos worker, City of Industry.

102
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:49,560
French-fry maker, Agoura. How absurd.
- Yeah? You think it's funny?

103
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:55,608
There's room to move as a fry cook.
I could be manager in two years.

104
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,944
King! God!

105
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:05,576
Kevin, I had this wild dream
the other night. - I bet.

106
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,578
It was you and me,

107
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:13,792
we were working in this sleazy motel,
down in Miami, Florida.

108
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:17,463
We were bellhops,

109
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,427
and we were 65 years old. It was
so real, it was really realistic.

110
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,971
Then what,
you woke up in a puddle?

111
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,767
Fuck you!
- Fucking jerk!

112
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,686
Where are you going, asshole?
- Away from you.

113
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,420
The Lord has told me personally: Yea,

114
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,590
for I walk with the Lord. Amen.

115
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:05,177
He said: "Larry, you and your flock
shall seek the Promised Land.

116
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,805
First you must destroy the twin evils

117
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:12,434
of godless communism abroad and
liberal humanism at home. Oh joy."

118
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:16,563
Hello mother! Hello father!
Anything to eat?

119
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:19,983
Occasionally a viewer writes to us:

120
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:26,407
"The only reason Reverend Larry is
on TV is because he wants your money."

121
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:31,954
You know what? They're right. I want
your money, because God wants it.

122
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:36,583
So go out and
mortgage that home, and sell that car,

123
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,337
and send me your money.
You don't need that car...

124
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:43,757
Put it on a plate, son.
You'll enjoy it more.

125
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:47,428
I couldn't enjoy it any more, Mom.

126
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:49,763
This is swell!

127
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:57,354
Hey Dad...
- What is it, son?

128
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,651
Remember when you told me,
a long time ago...

129
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,571
well not too long ago...

130
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:10,659
that you'd give me 1000 dollars
to go to Europe, if I finished school?

131
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,120
You were right,

132
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:16,707
about finishing school.
That's what I'd like to do.

133
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:22,212
But I want to know if I could
have the money first. Like now?

134
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,716
I've always loved you, Dad.

135
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:29,428
You too, Mom. What do you say?

136
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,680
I don't have it anymore.

137
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:39,521
What? - Your father gave all
our extra money to the Reverend.

138
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,817
We're sending bibles to El Salvador.

139
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:55,704
And me? - You're on the honor roll
of "Chariots of Fire". Same as us.

140
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:59,207
It was a gift. From all of us.

141
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,634
So how much do I get paid? 25 bucks
a car? - Paid? You don't get paid.

142
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:12,471
You work on commission,
that's much better.

143
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:15,766
Most cars are worth 200 - 300 dollars.

144
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:19,519
A 50,000 dollar Porsche
might make you five grand.

145
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,022
Come on, dickhead!

146
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,903
It helps if you
dress like a detective.

147
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,324
Detectives dress kind of square.

148
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:38,538
If people think you're a cop,
they think you're packing something.

149
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,209
Then they won't fuck with you.

150
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:46,546
Are you? - Am I what?
- Packin' something.

151
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:49,132
Only an asshole gets killed for a car.

152
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,303
The guys who make it
get in their car at any time.

153
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,473
Get in at 3 AM,
get up at 4.

154
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:02,562
That's why there ain't a repo man
I know that don't take speed.

155
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,314
Speed, huh?

156
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,862
Jesus Christ!

157
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,993
Never broke into a car, never
hot-wired a car.

158
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:19,871
I never
broke into a trunk.

159
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:23,125
I shall not cause harm to a vehicle,
or the personal contents thereof.

160
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:28,839
Nor through inaction, let vehicle or
personal contents come to harm.

161
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,383
That's what I call the repo code, kid.

162
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,302
Don't forget it.
Etch it in your brain.

163
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:38,181
Not many people
got a code to live by anymore.

164
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,892
Look at those assholes over there!

165
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:46,231
Ordinary people. I hate them.
- Me too! - What do you know?

166
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,777
An ordinary person spends his life
avoiding tense situations.

167
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:54,448
A repo man spends his life
getting into tense situations.

168
00:20:56,658 --> 00:20:58,410
Let's go get a drink.

169
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:00,996
Get into 5 or 6 tense situations a day

170
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:05,959
and it don't mean shit. I've seen
men stabbed, guns... don't mean shit!

171
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:10,755
That's when you got to watch yourself.
I'll handle it, pal, settle down.

172
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,971
Have a nice day, or night.
Day, night, it doesn't mean shit.

173
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:27,230
Wasn't that Otto?
- Otto who?

174
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:03,767
There'll be some
bad shit coming down one day.

175
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:08,396
Yeah, and where will you be?
On the moon?

176
00:22:09,898 --> 00:22:13,693
I'm going to be right here,
heading north at 110 per.

177
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,153
In this junker?

178
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:25,997
Cool car!

179
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,376
The Rodriguez Brothers!

180
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:33,505
Motherfucker just flipped you off!
- Roll the window down!

181
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:37,676
Where you going, asshole?
- To fuck your wife!

182
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,638
Watch it, motherfucker!
- Fuck you, pussy punk!

183
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:43,556
Holy shit!

184
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:45,517
Want me to take them?

185
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,528
That was cool!

186
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:19,843
God damned dipshit Rodriguez
gypsy dildo punks!

187
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:22,470
I'll get your asses!

188
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,934
That was intense!
- A repo man's always intense.

189
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:30,812
Come on, let's go get a drink!

190
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:34,482
Gee Bud, you never told me
it was going to be like this.

191
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:36,943
Cops and robbers!

192
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,404
Real live car chases!

193
00:23:57,255 --> 00:24:00,341
Debbi! - If you say our names,
we'll have to kill them, Archie.

194
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:03,928
They all ran away!
- Come on, douche bags!

195
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,196
Awful quiet in here.

196
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:23,990
Too quiet.

197
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,036
Who are these Rodriguez Boys?

198
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:31,873
Rodriguez Brothers.
Lagarto and Napoleon.

199
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:36,836
Notorious delinquents, responsible for
at least 30 vehicles in the field.

200
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:43,176
Scumbags! - They ain't scumbags,
they're car thieves, just like us.

201
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,931
There's Mrs. Magruder.
You want to go for it?

202
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,811
Good gag. You pull this one a lot?

203
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:57,523
Only on women. Never fails.

204
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,613
Excuse me, Mrs. Magruder?

205
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:06,658
I have something for you.

206
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:12,121
How charming!

207
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,088
Motherfucker!

208
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,885
Lite, where are you?

209
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,899
Ruthside Peason, brokerage consultant.
Millionaire, 6 payments behind.

210
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,860
I've never understood it.
- What?

211
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:46,948
Millionaires never pay their bills.
See you at the yard.

212
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:51,911
Let me get this one. - No, I'll do it.
Mr. Peason has a permit for a pistol.

213
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:56,457
Hey! Give me that!
- Don't underestimate me, ace.

214
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,511
Also, I would like
them to be close to the window,

215
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:12,140
so I can sit in my car
and watch them spin.

216
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:16,644
So all you have to do is
take your clothes out, and

217
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:19,313
put them in the machine over there.

218
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,943
Oh my god!

219
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:27,613
Oh my god! Stop!

220
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,170
Hey! Do you need a ride?

221
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,714
Hey, baby, need a ride?

222
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:53,598
Pick it up!

223
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:03,316
Pick it up! You know yourself
that you were wrong.

224
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:07,153
Why were they in the middle
of the street? - They weren't.

225
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,449
That's not the middle of the street,
that's the corner.

226
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:17,747
Go on, you pick it up.
- What? - You pick it up!

227
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:23,002
No way! You still want a ride?
- No I don't.

228
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:35,181
My name's Otto.
- Leila.

229
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:39,143
Is this your car?
- It's one of them.

230
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,981
One of them? You think you're
pretty slick, don't you?

231
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,609
I'll bet you're
a used car salesman.

232
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:50,112
I am not.
- You dress like one.

233
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,574
I'm a repo man.
- What's that?

234
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,871
A repossessor. I take back cars
from dildos who don't pay their bills.

235
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,541
Cool, huh?
- No.

236
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,380
What are you doing? - Those men
in the car next to us, don't look!

237
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,007
If they see me
they'll kill me.

238
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:12,218
Really? Why?

239
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:16,097
What the hell are you doing?

240
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,684
What's going on?
- Take a look at this.

241
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:27,191
Looks like sausage.

242
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:32,530
It isn't sausage, Otto.
That's a picture of 4 dead aliens.

243
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:42,123
Laugh away! It'll be on the cover
of every major paper in two days.

244
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,792
How do you know?
- I'm part of a secret network.

245
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:50,214
A scientist in our secret sect
smuggled the corpses off an army base.

246
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:54,844
Now he's got them in
the trunk of his car, a Chevy Malibu.

247
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:57,430
We've got to find him.

248
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,516
What will you do with them,
put them on "Johnny Carson"?

249
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:05,104
Yes! We'll have a press conference
and tell the world.

250
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,616
United Fruitcake Outlet.

251
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:20,077
My door doesn't work.

252
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:31,255
No matter how appealing, do not
let strange creatures into your house.

253
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:36,552
Strange creatures are on the increase,
many seem adorable, but beware!

254
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:38,679
We know not whence they came...

255
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:42,308
Thanks for the ride.
- Sure.

256
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:48,397
Do you want
to go out with me again?

257
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:52,151
I don't know, I'm kind of busy,
with the Malibu and all.

258
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:58,657
Great. Terrific. Here's your shit!

259
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:04,455
What's your problem? Girls might
like you if you lightened up a bit.

260
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:08,834
Fuck! Girls pay to go out with me.
All right?

261
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,588
Wanna get back in the car?

262
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,011
What, here?
- Yeah.

263
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,389
Fuck the seat!

264
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,772
20,000 dollars for a Chevy Malibu?

265
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:35,444
Who's "Double X Finance"?
- Storefront operation.

266
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,738
But the money is in escrow.

267
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,451
Want me to notify the boys?

268
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,956
E.T. S WILL LAND ANY DAY NOW

269
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,209
No. I think I'll go out for a while.
- Why? Are we out of beer?

270
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:53,003
Somebody has to work around here.

271
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,800
Keep making me money, kid.
- Fuck you.

272
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:02,137
We've been after this red devil
for a long time. Just act natural.

273
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:06,433
Nobody knows if it's your car or not.
Don't worry about that.

274
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,645
You give it a try. All right?

275
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:18,279
Better be fast if he finds us, boy.
- Got it!

276
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:30,708
Let's get out of here.

277
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,466
Oh, man!

278
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,642
Put your seatbelt on, boy!

279
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:52,813
I don't ride with anybody without
a seatbelt. It's one of my rules.

280
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:08,162
Put that gun down, boy.
It ain't no toy. Shit!

281
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:16,503
I walk into someone's
place of work.

282
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,591
They're shit scared.
They know I'm not a cop.

283
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,469
They think I've come to kill them,
and I would.

284
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:28,974
I'd kill anybody who crosses me.
You know what I mean?

285
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,105
Do you like music?
- Sure.

286
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,233
Then you'll love this.

287
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,447
I was into these dudes before anybody.
Partied with them all the time.

288
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:48,243
Asked me to be their manager.
I called bullshit on that.

289
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:55,084
Managing a pop group?
That ain't a job for no man.

290
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:03,425
Did you read that book I gave you?
- What book?

291
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:06,845
"Dioretix. The Science of
Matter over Mind".

292
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:11,642
You better read it, and quick.
That book will change your life.

293
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,562
Found it in a Maserati
in Beverly Hills. Know what I mean?

294
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:19,942
Lots of people don't realize
what's really going on.

295
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:24,905
They view life as a bunch of
unconnected incidents and things.

296
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:27,741
They don't realize
that there's this

297
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:31,370
lattice of coincidence
on top of everything.

298
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:35,123
I'll give you an example
to show you what I mean:

299
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,962
Suppose you're thinking about
a plate of shrimp.

300
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:45,926
Suddenly, somebody says:
Plate, or shrimp, or plate of shrimp.

301
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:49,304
No point in looking
for an explanation.

302
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:53,308
It's all part
of a cosmic unconsciousness.

303
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:56,645
Did you eat a lot of acid,
back in the hippie days?

304
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:59,398
I'll give you another instance:

305
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:02,818
You know the way everybody's
into weirdness right now?

306
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:07,364
Books in all the supermarkets
about Bermuda Triangles,

307
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:12,911
UFOs, how the Mayans
invented TV, that kind of thing?

308
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:15,080
I don't read them books.

309
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,833
For me it's exactly the same.

310
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,088
There's no difference between
a flying saucer and a time machine.

311
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:28,760
People get so hung up on specifics,
they can't see the whole thing.

312
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,681
Take South America, for example:

313
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:37,436
There, thousands of people
go missing each year.

314
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:43,775
Nobody knows where they go.
They just disappear.

315
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:50,574
But if you think about it,
you realize something:

316
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:55,579
There had to be a time when
there was no people, right? - Yeah.

317
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:58,957
Well, where
did all these people come from?

318
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,338
I'll tell you where: The future.

319
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,216
Where did all these
people disappear to?

320
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,803
The past? - That's right!
And how did they get there?

321
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,056
How the fuck do I know?

322
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,558
Flying saucers.

323
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:20,103
Which are really...

324
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:25,108
yeah you got it...
...time machines.

325
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,365
I think a lot about this stuff.

326
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:38,080
I do my best thinking on the bus.
That's how come I don't drive.

327
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:40,707
You don't even know how to drive.

328
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:44,252
I don't want to know how.
See?

329
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:47,380
The more you drive,

330
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:51,384
the less intelligent you are.

331
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:59,184
I think I saw
one of those UFOs once.

332
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:05,649
It was really kind of scary, it was
all these colored lights and sounds.

333
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:11,488
Sounds and lights like I've never
heard before. It was really weird.

334
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:18,620
Bud? Do you think all repo men
follow the code?

335
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,622
Of course.

336
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:27,963
A lot of fucked up cars come in, but
mostly the customer's fucked them up.

337
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,589
Assholes!

338
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:46,857
I'll give 1000 dollars for his Falcon.
That's a bribe, Napoleon.

339
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:50,318
Who the hell is this? "Napoleon"?
Who are you calling?

340
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:54,114
A grand if you show me
where his car is.

341
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:56,741
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

342
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:58,201
Hello?

343
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,454
Prick!

344
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:06,668
64 Chevy Malibu. 20 grand.

345
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm waiting!
- We could buy 10 of them for that.

346
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:15,552
Think you can find it now? - Why is
this junk worth so much? What's in it?

347
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:17,554
Drugs?

348
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:23,727
Los Hermanos Rodriguez
don't approve of drugs.

349
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:26,354
Neither do I,
but it's my birthday.

350
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,610
That motherfucker's still down there.

351
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,531
I don't care how long it takes,
dildos!

352
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:40,827
A repo man's got all night,
every night.

353
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:55,258
Jesus Christ! 20,000 dollars!

354
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:03,475
Hi, this is Leila.
Please leave your name,

355
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:07,145
number, and a brief message,
and the time you called, at the beep.

356
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:09,773
And please try to be frank.

357
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,527
Hey Leila. This is Otto,
the guy who gave you the ride.

358
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,864
I heard something about that car.

359
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:36,508
Otto. Otto, stop!
You wanted to tell me something.

360
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,808
What did you want to tell me?

361
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:48,520
Take off your clothes.

362
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:52,399
I'm at work, Otto.
- Yeah? Me too.

363
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:55,443
Your work is different than mine.
- Says who?

364
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,279
What are you doing? Don't!

365
00:38:59,197 --> 00:39:01,658
At least you could
give me a blowjob.

366
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:05,954
I guess that means no.

367
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:10,500
We have a
cell meeting in two minutes time.

368
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:14,254
Thanks, Deadra. I'll be right there.

369
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:26,549
That motherfucker thinks
I don't know what's up, Lite.

370
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:30,094
As soon as I find that Chevy,
I'm going indy.

371
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:34,640
I'm getting myself a tow truck,
a couple of pit bulls and a yard.

372
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:38,519
Sit around and watch
everyone else work for a while.

373
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:42,064
You can't do that on 20 grand.
- The hell I can't.

374
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:46,569
As long as you have good credit,
and my credit is spotless.

375
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:52,491
Credit is a sacred trust.

376
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:55,619
It's what our free society
is founded on.

377
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:59,331
Do you think they
give a damn about bills in Russia?

378
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:03,294
I said, do you think they give a damn
about their bills in Russia?

379
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:06,130
They don't pay bills in Russia.
It's all free.

380
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:10,175
All free? Free my ass!
What are, you, a commie?

381
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:15,848
I'm no commie. - You better not be!
I don't want no commies in my car.

382
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,225
No Christians either!

383
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,917
I'll deal with you later.
I've got a customer.

384
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:47,171
You too.

385
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:50,007
Hi, I'm Kevin. Vacuum, sir?

386
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:05,898
Need a vacuum, sir?

387
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,838
Want me to check the trunk?

388
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:32,841
Excuse me?

389
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:44,186
Hi, I'm Kevin! - Hey, don't you
remember me? I was here yesterday.

390
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:48,607
I think I left my matches in your
office. Can you go and check for me?

391
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:50,818
Sure thing.

392
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:55,197
Anything for you. - You're
beautiful. - I'll be right back.

393
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,050
What?

394
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,686
It's very simple, Mrs. Parks.

395
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:29,022
You don't want me to take it,
and I don't want to.

396
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:34,611
I said to my boss: Look, I don't want
to repossess this lady's car.

397
00:42:35,028 --> 00:42:39,491
I've been in the hospital, you see.
- I understand.

398
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:43,412
But my job is really
on the line over this one.

399
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:49,418
I'll see if I can borrow some money.
- That's terrific. Terrific.

400
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:58,927
How was rehearsal, son?
- Okay. Who's this?

401
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:04,016
This is Mr. Otto, deary.
From the finance company.

402
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,812
He told me he isn't going to
take the car this time,

403
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:11,523
even though he could.

404
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:15,861
Well...

405
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:20,449
gotta get going.

406
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:36,798
Did you like the tea?

407
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,509
The tea?

408
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:42,346
Yeah, it was terrific.

409
00:43:44,848 --> 00:43:46,266
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

410
00:43:54,524 --> 00:43:58,654
I gave you the money last week,
and you didn't pay it.

411
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:02,991
I'm tired of giving you money,
and you squandering it.

412
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:06,328
You all went out dancing somewhere.

413
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:10,832
Next time, you better put the money
on the car. You're working.

414
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:15,295
How come you didn't do it?
What's wrong with you?

415
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:51,748
Hey, everything's cool!
I like music too, man.

416
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:15,147
Some people ain't cut out to be
a repo man. Why don't you smarten up?

417
00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:17,566
Fuck you, Plettschner!

418
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:20,819
Don't say fuck to me!
Don't you know who I am?

419
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:24,739
You're Plettschner.
- Damn right! Otto Plettschner.

420
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:29,452
3 times decorated in 2 world wars.
I was killing people while you

421
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,996
were in your dad's balls.

422
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,541
Worked 5 years in a slaughterhouse
and 10 years as prison guard.

423
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:38,545
So what? - "So what"?
Never say "fuck you" to me,

424
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:41,673
because you haven't
earned the rights yet.

425
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,843
Hey kid,
I need a contract driver.

426
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,263
See what I mean, punk?

427
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,643
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

428
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,105
You scumbag!
- Shut up, Plettschner.

429
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,816
Don't ever tell me to shut up.

430
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,825
Shit!

431
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:14,080
It's too hot in here, man.
What the hell's going on?

432
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:20,211
That shit in the trunk must be
melting. We better take a look.

433
00:46:24,174 --> 00:46:26,593
Get us 2 sodas.
- As soon as I check the trunk.

434
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,096
We're just the mules. OK? Move it.

435
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:12,055
"Helping Hand"
- Marlene, we found the car.

436
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,517
Come on, guys!

437
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:23,191
Get the ladder!
- Stop pushing, Duke!

438
00:47:25,235 --> 00:47:28,988
My medication! Aw man!
- Be cool, dude. We got more.

439
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:31,449
Let me help, Archie.

440
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:33,326
Come on!

441
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:48,341
Well, that's not all. This car
is hot. - What, stolen?

442
00:47:48,758 --> 00:47:53,012
No, hot, really hot.
We're sweating like pigs, man.

443
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,808
Where is the car from?
- Someplace...

444
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:59,894
...Roswell, New Mexico.

445
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:36,890
Me, fight in a war?
No way!

446
00:48:37,307 --> 00:48:41,477
Nobody's got to do that shit.
Not in this country.

447
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:46,691
A new ID don't cost no more
than a pink slip.

448
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,527
Something wrong?

449
00:48:51,905 --> 00:48:53,907
You know, that Marlene,

450
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:57,202
she's pretty hot.

451
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:03,166
Otto, my man, I jumped on
that action from day one.

452
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:06,794
I found out where
she's coming from.

453
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:10,673
See you back at the yard.
- Have fun.

454
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,400
Holy shit!

455
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:15,655
Holy fucking shit!

456
00:50:25,164 --> 00:50:27,834
Lite! Open the door!

457
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:30,962
There's a maniac in there.
What are you doing?

458
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:33,005
Open the door!

459
00:50:33,423 --> 00:50:36,759
What are you doing? Open the door!

460
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:42,765
You're still on the job, white boy.
Get in the car. - Open the door, Lite!

461
00:50:44,183 --> 00:50:46,227
Get in the car!
- Jesus Christ!

462
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,912
You're crazy, Lite.

463
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,040
You can't just shoot into
peoples' houses.

464
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:12,044
Maybe you shot the guy.
- So what if I did?

465
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:15,006
I don't know.
I mean, that's pretty severe.

466
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,221
Jesus Christ!

467
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:27,101
Hey, blanks do the job too.

468
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:32,857
You repo men are all out to lunch.
Let's get out of here.

469
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:43,659
Hello?

470
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:54,212
Is it you? This is Leila.
Are you using a scrambler?

471
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:58,174
I can't hear you,
I'm using a scrambler.

472
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:05,014
Look out!
- What?

473
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:23,783
Happy face!

474
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,744
You want a ride?

475
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:32,166
Help!

476
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,418
No!

477
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:40,341
What do you want from me?
- We ask the questions.

478
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:44,428
Are you going to torture me?
- Torture you? What for?

479
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:50,101
To find out what I know.
I'd torture someone in a second.

480
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:55,731
Why are you after the Malibu?
- Because of the aliens in the trunk.

481
00:52:56,148 --> 00:53:01,404
Illegal aliens?
- No, silly, extraterrestrials.

482
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:05,533
Ever thought about joining the CIA?
- I have to ask my boyfriend.

483
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,996
Otto Maddox, Male, White, 21...
Correction: 18.

484
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:16,502
What's going on?
- The usual.

485
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,755
Hi Marlene! How you doing, baby?

486
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:23,342
Jesus, who done that to you?
- Who done what?

487
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:28,305
"Who done what", he says.
Who did that to your face, kid?

488
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:30,766
Some dude. It doesn't matter.
- Oh yes it does!

489
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:33,227
Do something, Plettschner.
Aren't you a cop?

490
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,312
I'm on my coffee break.

491
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,692
Repo man don't go running
to the man. Repo man goes it alone.

492
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:41,193
Yessireebob!

493
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,406
Just like John Wayne.
- Damn right! What's wrong with that?

494
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:50,369
Greatest American that ever lived.
- John Wayne was a fag. - What?

495
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:53,748
What?
- John Wayne was a fag.

496
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:56,292
The hell he was!

497
00:53:57,126 --> 00:53:59,420
He was too, boys.

498
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:03,466
I installed 2-way mirrors
in his pad in Brentwood.

499
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,843
And he came to the door in a dress.

500
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,723
You're nuts. - That doesn't mean
he was a homo, Miller.

501
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:15,352
A lot of straight guys like to watch
their buddies fuck. I know I do.

502
00:54:16,103 --> 00:54:18,689
- Don't you?
- I sure do.

503
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:21,817
Fuck John Wayne!
Tell us his name, you little pussy!

504
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,236
Piss off, ass-wipes.

505
00:54:25,446 --> 00:54:28,282
You bastards!
- Easy!

506
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,868
The guy's head is hurt.

507
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:33,662
You're taking this
too personal, son.

508
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,458
The thing is, a repo man
got beat up in the line of duty.

509
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,044
It doesn't matter that it was you.

510
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:44,673
What really matters,
is that the guy pays the price.

511
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,010
Now stop being selfish,
and tell us his name.

512
00:54:48,427 --> 00:54:49,512
Come on!

513
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:51,931
Bastard!

514
00:54:52,348 --> 00:54:53,849
All right!

515
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:56,393
OK, his name was...

516
00:55:09,531 --> 00:55:11,533
Mr. Humphries?
- Yes?

517
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:15,204
Yes, I'm Mr. Humphries.
What do you want?

518
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:20,876
...U.S. Planes napalmed refugee camps
in southern Mexico. He explained that

519
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:23,879
the camps were really guerrilla bases.

520
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:27,132
In Guatemala, shots were fired
at the U.S. Embassy...

521
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:34,974
"Helping Hand", Marlene speaking.
- Hello, is Otto there?

522
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:38,560
It's for you. A girl.

523
00:55:43,732 --> 00:55:45,901
Hi Otto? It's Leila.

524
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:50,030
Leila who?

525
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:22,646
Can't believe I once liked these guys.
- Listen to me!

526
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:27,359
For the sake of future generations,
please tell us everything you know.

527
00:56:27,776 --> 00:56:30,029
Sure, I need another drink.

528
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:34,658
These aliens aren't even on ice,
they could be starting to decay.

529
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,161
We've got to find them.

530
00:56:37,578 --> 00:56:39,747
Well, well, well!

531
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:45,544
If it ain't the repo man.
- You look like shit, wanker.

532
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:48,255
Duke, Debbi, Archie,

533
00:56:49,757 --> 00:56:52,176
meet Leila
and her weird friend.

534
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:55,721
How you doing, asshole?

535
00:56:56,138 --> 00:57:00,017
How come you don't hang out with
your friends anymore? - What friends?

536
00:57:02,394 --> 00:57:04,521
Want some ludes, dude?

537
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:10,402
I really love you.

538
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:15,240
Because you always
visited me when I was in juvie.

539
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:17,367
I was busy. I told you I was working.

540
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:19,369
Wow, a metal hand!

541
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:21,038
Cool!

542
00:57:23,582 --> 00:57:25,667
Can we feel it?

543
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:43,769
Fuck this!
Let's go do some crimes.

544
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:46,230
Nice friends you got there, Otto

545
00:57:46,939 --> 00:57:49,107
Thanks, I made them myself.

546
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:04,548
Hey, what the fuck are you
doing with our car? - Your car?

547
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:10,387
Are you sure?
This looks like my car.

548
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:14,391
Are there pecan pies in the back?
- Not any more. We ate them.

549
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:18,645
Shut up, Archie.
- You shut up. - You're still here?

550
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,606
My car looks just like this.

551
00:58:22,023 --> 00:58:24,776
But this is yours, your car?

552
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:27,863
Yeah, 4 eyes.
- Of course...

553
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,616
What's in the trunk?
- What do you mean?

554
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:36,037
You don't even know what's in
your own trunk. You know what?

555
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:38,873
I think you're afraid to find out.

556
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,458
Kill him!

557
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:45,005
I ain't afraid of nothing, see?
- I don't blame you for being afraid.

558
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:49,467
I said, I ain't afraid of nothing.
I kill people like you.

559
00:58:49,884 --> 00:58:52,095
Oh well, I guess you're right.

560
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:57,058
It's better not to look.

561
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:01,938
Beautiful evening.
You can almost see the stars.

562
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:04,608
Oh shut up!

563
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:07,319
He's going to open it.

564
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,906
Come on, Duke!
- The thing is hot!

565
00:59:15,827 --> 00:59:17,829
Look, we don't have all night.

566
00:59:29,883 --> 00:59:32,344
Close it, Duke! No!

567
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,558
Dukie Wookie
hurt his wittle hand.

568
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,018
Fuck you, Archie!

569
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:43,855
Just for that, you're not in the gang.
- I'm taking over now.

570
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:46,232
Oh, leave it!
- King Archie!

571
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,610
The Invincible!
- Shut up, Archie!

572
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,781
Watch this!

573
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:58,912
Oh dear!

574
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:03,249
What a shame! - Come on,
Duke, let's go do those crimes.

575
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:10,924
Yeah. Let's get sushi...
and not pay.

576
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:28,983
Hey buddy!

577
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:32,445
Special deputies, pull over!

578
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,198
Special deputies, pull over!

579
01:00:36,616 --> 01:00:40,120
So the farmer says
the ice broke and he fell in...

580
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:45,333
Look at these people,
there's one person in each car.

581
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:49,963
The city wants us to carpool,
but nobody gives a shit.

582
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,468
If people carpool,
we'd be out of work. - Bullshit!

583
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,596
"Why has that pig got a wooden leg?"

584
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:03,518
"Well," said the farmer,
"about 3 months ago..."

585
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:05,979
Look at that car!

586
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,440
Hey, Budsky, there's your girlfriend.

587
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:12,277
The Rodriguez Brothers!

588
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:15,989
We got the whole team here tonight,
let's settle this for good.

589
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,075
Let's do it!
- Pull over!

590
01:01:20,618 --> 01:01:22,161
Shit, it's Bud!

591
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,212
Don't lose him!

592
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:36,885
Take it easy. Stop the car!

593
01:02:05,413 --> 01:02:09,042
Motherfucker, come on!
What are you waiting for?

594
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,003
Motherfucker!
I kick your fucking ass! Come on!

595
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,715
Come on!
What'll you do with that bat?

596
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,679
You bad, Bud! This is going to
cost you plenty! - What do you mean?

597
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:26,059
How's your neck, Napoleon?
- Oh, my neck. Yeah. Oh shit!

598
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,645
I think I got whiplash!

599
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:34,400
Besides, this isn't a repo car.
- Bullshit! I got the papers on it.

600
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:39,197
We paid it off.
See, this is our favorite car.

601
01:02:39,614 --> 01:02:41,658
That's right! You got insurance?

602
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:51,042
Come on, cocksucker!
Whose side are you on?

603
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:54,629
Let me loose, God damn it!

604
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,556
Shit! This is bullshit, Oly!

605
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:09,602
Yeah, that's what I said when the
marshal woke me at 4 in the morning.

606
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,105
Unfortunately, it's a summons.

607
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:16,192
You should have refused it.
- Have you read it?

608
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:20,196
The Rodriguez Brothers are suing us
for malicious damage, medical expenses

609
01:03:20,613 --> 01:03:24,534
and harassment, for a car they own.
- The Rodriguez Brothers are...

610
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:28,579
you believe the Rodriguez Brothers?
They're a couple of scumbags!

611
01:03:28,996 --> 01:03:32,125
I know, but we need to sit down
and get our stories straight.

612
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:36,546
You're taking their word over mine!
- I was there, remember?

613
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:41,425
Go home.
Take the rest of the week off.

614
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:45,096
The rest? I can't take the...

615
01:03:46,931 --> 01:03:51,602
Oh I get it, so that you can get
the 20,000 dollars for the Malibu.

616
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:55,773
Make it a fucking month!
- Well, fuck you.

617
01:03:57,316 --> 01:04:01,737
On second thought,
don't bother coming back at all.

618
01:04:02,155 --> 01:04:07,285
Great! I'll come back to get my stuff
when the place don't stink so bad.

619
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,585
Shut up!

620
01:04:21,549 --> 01:04:25,678
Fucking trash!
I wonder how much they owe?

621
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:30,600
Most of them are on the run, not even
using their social security numbers.

622
01:04:31,017 --> 01:04:33,936
If there was only a way
to make them pay...

623
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:39,191
Jesus, Bud, they're winos!
They don't have money.

624
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:43,029
Would they be bums if they did?
- Do you want out?

625
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:45,698
No!
- What's the matter with you?

626
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,951
Don't you like your job anymore?

627
01:04:50,745 --> 01:04:54,248
I feel like we're not
communicating anymore.

628
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:59,462
When we first started out,
I thought I could teach you something.

629
01:04:59,879 --> 01:05:01,422
Answer me!

630
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:33,704
I'm picking up the dead body.
I've got my hands around it.

631
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:38,376
I'm carrying his limp torso
to the truck.

632
01:05:38,793 --> 01:05:43,381
He feels like he's
been dead only a little while.

633
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:27,902
Do you ever feel as if your mind
had started to erode?

634
01:07:29,028 --> 01:07:30,321
No.

635
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,116
Ever been to Utah?

636
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:40,247
Sir, I represent the
"Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation."

637
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:43,626
Radiation, yes indeed!

638
01:07:44,335 --> 01:07:47,504
You hear the most
outrageous lies about it.

639
01:07:47,922 --> 01:07:52,760
Half-baked, goggle-boxed do-gooders
telling everybody it's bad for you.

640
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:59,433
Pernicious nonsense! Everybody could
stand 100 chest x-rays a year.

641
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:01,810
They should have them too.

642
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:05,189
When they cancelled the project,
it almost did me in.

643
01:08:05,606 --> 01:08:09,401
One day my mind was ready to burst,
the next day, nothing!

644
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,570
Swept away.

645
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:17,952
But I showed them.
I had a lobotomy in the end.

646
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:21,747
Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies?

647
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,876
Not at all.
A friend of mine had one.

648
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:31,131
Designer of the neutron bomb.
Ever heard of the neutron bomb?

649
01:08:31,715 --> 01:08:35,511
Destroys people,
leaves buildings standing.

650
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:41,058
Fits in a suitcase so small, no one
knows it's there, until: Blam!

651
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:46,605
Eyes melt,
skin explodes, everybody dead.

652
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:52,361
It's so immoral working on it,
it can drive you mad.

653
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,448
That happened to a friend of mine,
so he had a lobotomy.

654
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,868
Now he's well again.

655
01:09:02,162 --> 01:09:06,375
What kind of car does he drive?

656
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:08,544
Chevy Malibu.

657
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:13,382
This is really a nice old car.
Why don't you let me drive?

658
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:15,968
What do you mean?

659
01:09:16,427 --> 01:09:20,305
I don't know... I mean...
don't you feel funny?

660
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,851
Why should I feel funny?

661
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:27,020
The two hemispheres
are fundamentally at odds.

662
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:30,023
Hemisphere, hemisphere.

663
01:09:30,441 --> 01:09:33,360
It's strange,
I do feel funny...

664
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:08,080
PARTY AT MILLERS
CU THERE!

665
01:11:10,749 --> 01:11:14,378
Here's the young new waver
we've all heard so much about.

666
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:17,673
My old man used to
have a Mohawk.

667
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,175
He was in the service then.

668
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:24,513
He was such a monster,
I used to have to tell him no.

669
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:29,601
My old man was the same,
until we got married.

670
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:31,895
Hey Oly, your wife's all over Otto.

671
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,524
Like flies on shit.

672
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:39,903
Have you seen Bud?
- Who?

673
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:19,693
Hey Ace, wait up.

674
01:12:22,487 --> 01:12:25,991
You want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

675
01:12:27,284 --> 01:12:31,204
Why are you so mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.

676
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:34,332
I'm not.
- All right. OK.

677
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,294
Debbi?
- What?

678
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:41,381
I've been thinking.

679
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:45,093
Now that we got some money,

680
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,596
and Archie's gone...

681
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:52,642
don't you think
it's time we settled down?

682
01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:56,188
Get a little house?

683
01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:00,734
I want you to have my baby.
- Why?

684
01:13:02,402 --> 01:13:04,529
I don't know.

685
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:07,782
Everybody does it.

686
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,703
And it just seems
like the thing to do.

687
01:13:12,662 --> 01:13:14,623
Asshole.

688
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,752
Let's do the job!

689
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,053
Duke! Debbi! What are you doing here?

690
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,931
What's it look like, Ace?
- Against the wall!

691
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,311
I'll kill him! I kill everybody!

692
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,313
Drop it, motherfucker!

693
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:48,281
Shit!

694
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:24,150
Is it too late to get
romantically involved?

695
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:26,528
A little.

696
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:30,407
Wait! Stick with me,
and I'll make you a repo wife.

697
01:14:30,824 --> 01:14:32,867
Bollucks!

698
01:14:35,578 --> 01:14:36,705
Here!

699
01:14:56,224 --> 01:14:58,226
I'm here, man.

700
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,312
The lights are growing dim.

701
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:08,611
I know a life of crime led me
to this sorry fate...

702
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:13,575
And yet,
I blame society.

703
01:15:15,368 --> 01:15:18,121
Society made me
what I am.

704
01:15:18,538 --> 01:15:24,919
Bullshit! You're a white
suburban punk, just like me.

705
01:15:25,336 --> 01:15:29,549
But it still hurts.

706
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:38,016
You're gonna be all right.

707
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:45,482
Maybe not.

708
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:55,116
He's dead all right. - No doubt.
- A goner. - Man.

709
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:59,162
Booth's setting him on fire.

710
01:16:13,885 --> 01:16:15,136
The car!

711
01:16:15,553 --> 01:16:18,139
The Chevy Malibu! Where's the car?

712
01:16:18,556 --> 01:16:21,935
You better stay out of this.
- Why? - It's none of your business.

713
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:26,606
You want to be a hero?
I'd rather be a chicken man. - A what?

714
01:16:27,023 --> 01:16:30,860
A chicken man.
Did you ever see a farmer's wife?

715
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:33,029
Let go of me!

716
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:34,697
It's peaceful, man.

717
01:16:35,114 --> 01:16:36,824
The Malibu!

718
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:43,373
Let's go!

719
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:48,211
No, wait. My car's gone, and we're
going to get to the bottom of this.

720
01:16:48,628 --> 01:16:50,838
Like hell we are.

721
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,007
Not in my face!

722
01:16:53,716 --> 01:16:54,926
Freeze, Marlene!

723
01:16:56,094 --> 01:16:59,013
My face!
- Over my dead body.

724
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:02,976
If that's how you want it.
- Come and get me. Come on!

725
01:17:03,393 --> 01:17:06,729
I've been wanting to for a long time.
- Come on.

726
01:17:07,146 --> 01:17:09,774
Come on, if you're man enough.
- Hey Plettsch!

727
01:17:10,817 --> 01:17:12,610
Coffee break!

728
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:32,338
Good evening, Otto.
This is Agent Rogersz.

729
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:35,633
I'm going to
ask you a few questions.

730
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:40,722
Since time is short and you may lie,
I'm going to have to torture you.

731
01:17:41,306 --> 01:17:44,267
But I want you to know,
it isn't personal.

732
01:17:44,684 --> 01:17:49,772
This isn't really necessary. I'll
tell you anything you want to know.

733
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:53,901
Good. Where is the Malibu?
- I don't know.

734
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:57,196
Somebody
ripped it from the yard.

735
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:04,078
I don't think he knows.
- Increase the voltage!

736
01:18:04,495 --> 01:18:09,792
But what if he's innocent?
- No one is innocent. Proceed.

737
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:19,886
Look at them. High heels,
hairnets, ridiculous trenchcoats,

738
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:21,637
how pathetic!

739
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:26,142
Agent Rogersz, they're getting away!
- It's all part of the plan.

740
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,245
Otto, pull yourself together.

741
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:48,915
Marlene!

742
01:18:49,999 --> 01:18:53,169
What's going on?
- We're going to the hospital.

743
01:18:56,714 --> 01:18:59,300
Dr. Benway to surgery.

744
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:07,892
Hey, I know you! You're the one
who ran into my trash.

745
01:19:09,143 --> 01:19:10,311
Shh yourself!

746
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:19,821
Visiting hours are now over.
Thank you.

747
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,493
Out of order. Take the stairs.

748
01:19:35,378 --> 01:19:37,964
Mr. Lee:

749
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:42,218
Mr. Lee:
Please return the scalpel, Mr. Lee.

750
01:19:57,316 --> 01:20:00,528
Let me see that.
All wrong! Do it over.

751
01:20:00,945 --> 01:20:04,907
...and they won't pick it up.
- Isn't it a shame?

752
01:20:07,076 --> 01:20:12,039
It comes to something when
they expect you to pick it up.

753
01:20:12,456 --> 01:20:16,752
How are you doing?
- Ask him about the Malibu.

754
01:20:17,878 --> 01:20:19,213
About that night,

755
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:26,470
I'm sorry I split.
I should have stayed with you.

756
01:20:26,887 --> 01:20:31,183
But when I was a kid, I had
this set of big wheels...

757
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:35,354
Please, quiet in the stairwell.

758
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:52,747
A very sad and
unchristian thing just happened.

759
01:20:53,164 --> 01:20:55,207
A sweet old lady's
car was stolen,

760
01:20:55,624 --> 01:20:57,084
a Chevy Malibu.

761
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:02,673
Brothers and sisters please,
if you've seen this car,

762
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,051
call this toll-free number.

763
01:21:05,468 --> 01:21:08,346
Shit.
- Praise the Lord!

764
01:21:09,889 --> 01:21:11,307
Go, go!

765
01:21:13,559 --> 01:21:14,477
Come on!

766
01:21:14,518 --> 01:21:15,561
Let's go!

767
01:21:58,062 --> 01:22:00,231
Don't shoot! All right!

768
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:02,483
Chickenshits!

769
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,195
Where's the Malibu?

770
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:09,824
Don't even ask,
because I don't know.

771
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:13,536
I don't have it, neither does Marlene,
nor you or your crazy friends.

772
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,830
So that leaves...

773
01:22:17,915 --> 01:22:21,544
Where is he? - Where the fuck is he?
- He is risen. Holy...

774
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:51,490
Later!
- Bye bye!

775
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:03,377
Here's another weird one: Apparently,
a hail of ice cubes is coming down

776
01:23:03,794 --> 01:23:08,257
south of downtown. Scientists
are at a loss to explain...

777
01:23:40,873 --> 01:23:42,750
Some weird fucking shit, eh?

778
01:23:45,336 --> 01:23:48,255
What's going on?
- Shit!

779
01:23:48,839 --> 01:23:53,469
11 years of repoing cars,
and what have I got? Shit!

780
01:23:54,511 --> 01:23:59,266
Bud, listen: You're sitting in a car
worth 20,000 dollars.

781
01:23:59,725 --> 01:24:03,187
Look, we turn it in and
split the money, 60-40, you and me.

782
01:24:06,065 --> 01:24:07,649
Who gets the 60, kid?

783
01:24:08,067 --> 01:24:10,486
Well, I thought,
since I found the car first, that...

784
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:14,490
that you'd get it.

785
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:21,914
Get away from the car.
This is your only warning.

786
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:24,124
We got problems, man!

787
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:32,633
No, no no no! Wait!

788
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:38,180
Stop fucking around!
Only assholes get killed for a car.

789
01:24:38,764 --> 01:24:40,724
You calling me an asshole, punk?

790
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:44,520
I sure am.
- Come and get me, copper!

791
01:24:44,937 --> 01:24:48,065
I'm well-armed,
and I know where you live.

792
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,572
Son of a bitch! - I'd rather die
on my feet than live on my knees.

793
01:25:00,244 --> 01:25:03,580
Come on, you popsicles,
let's get that car!

794
01:25:05,707 --> 01:25:08,001
Hey Oly, there's Bud!

795
01:25:10,337 --> 01:25:14,716
We'll drive it off a cliff.
- I have the car papers. Beer anyone?

796
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:18,095
Hey, Bud, want a beer?
- No, a cigarette.

797
01:25:18,512 --> 01:25:21,390
No beer is needed here.

798
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:27,437
I'm touching the car.
I'm encountering a strange,

799
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:31,942
eerie kind of forcefield.
I don't know what it is. It's...

800
01:25:43,078 --> 01:25:44,621
Go on, you popsicles!

801
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,750
I'm having the same feeling...

802
01:25:59,052 --> 01:26:02,598
I love this job. - Linear and inverse
vectors merge in zero.

803
01:26:03,015 --> 01:26:05,017
This way, your Holiness!

804
01:26:14,985 --> 01:26:17,070
It's more than a job,
it's... it's a calling.

805
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:22,618
Critical mass is at zero...
- Why, you could say it's spiritual.

806
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,625
Holy sheepshit!

807
01:26:35,464 --> 01:26:37,591
Get back, get back!

808
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:46,933
Get in there, or you don't get paid!

809
01:26:47,351 --> 01:26:50,354
Have you read this book? "Dioretix"?

810
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:52,731
Chapter 7, verse 3.
- I've got it marked.

811
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:05,661
Miller, what are you doing?
- I'm going for a little spin.

812
01:27:06,161 --> 01:27:08,497
But you don't know how to drive?

813
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:20,759
Otto, don't go!

814
01:27:21,176 --> 01:27:24,012
What about our relationship?

815
01:27:25,055 --> 01:27:26,098
What?

816
01:27:27,682 --> 01:27:30,394
What about our relationship?

817
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:32,354
Fuck that.

818
01:27:33,563 --> 01:27:34,856
You shithead!

819
01:27:35,273 --> 01:27:39,403
I'm glad I tortured you.
I'm supposed to be in that car!

820
01:28:10,976 --> 01:28:13,103
Best goddamned car in the yard.

821
01:28:45,302 --> 01:28:47,053
Wow! This is intense!

822
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:50,140
The life of a repo man
is always intense.
