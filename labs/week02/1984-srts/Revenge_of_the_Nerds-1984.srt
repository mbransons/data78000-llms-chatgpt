{1271}{1360}- You remember the first time you left home?|- Yes.
{1362}{1435}And I was just as scared as you are.
{1437}{1541}I'm not scared. I just don't like|the idea of leaving you here all alone.
{1543}{1635}Oh, I'll be fine. I was fine|when you went away to computer camp.
{1651}{1718}Mom, that was just for two weeks.
{1720}{1822}I can take care of myself.|I'm much more worried about you.

{3523}{3624}I got two thirty-seven.|Dad, how fast are we going?
{3626}{3706}I've got the old cruise control set at 35.
{4477}{4543}Adams College, home of the Atoms.
{4563}{4616}Gilbert, this is gonna be really neat.
{4618}{4682}I sure hope so. What if it isn't, huh?
{4684}{4753}Don't be so negative.|We'll have the time of our lives.
{4755}{4815}I'm not being negative. I'm being nervous.
{4817}{4881}Don't be, cos everything's gonna be great.
{4883}{4954}- Just like high school, right?|- This is college.
{4956}{5066}Remember, there are|6,127 students at Adams.
{5068}{5131}- 58 per cent of which are girls.|- So?

{5542}{5580}Dad!
{5718}{5790}(Lewis) Wow! This campus is awesome.
{5816}{5941}It's a lot bigger than I expected. Maybe|we should have just gone to City Tech, huh?
{5943}{6073}Tech's nothin'. You know Adams has got|the best computer department in the country.
{6075}{6161}Yeah, you're right. Adams is the best.
{6710}{6787}(Mr Skolnick) Well, boys...|I mean "men"... here we are.

{7032}{7140}I'm proud of you. Your father would|have been proud of you, too, Gilbert.
{7142}{7271}I know, Mr Skolnick. Don't tell my mother|I was nervous. I wouldn't want her to worry.

{8354}{8414}Gilbert, help me with the trunk.
{8483}{8545}- Uh, Gilbert?|- Yes, sir?
{8581}{8640}College isn't like high school.
{8642}{8723}You'll be on your own.|I want you to take care of yourself.
{8725}{8815}I will. Anyway, I won't be alone. I got Lewis.
{8817}{8874}Besides, we're college men now, right?

{10459}{10527}You know, Gilbert, I feel different already.
{10529}{10602}Like... more mature.
{10604}{10660}Looks like we're in for quite a change.
{10662}{10788}I'll say. Parties, meeting new people.|This is really gonna be great.

{46536}{46583}Excuse me, but... why?
{46585}{46694}According to our charter, you must|have a national fraternity as your sponsor.

{47882}{47926}(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda?
{47928}{48006}Yeah. They're gonna love us.
{48120}{48189}As you know, we have|no chapter at Adams College,

{48254}{48394}But I must tell you, gentlemen, you have|very little chance of becoming Tri-Lambdas.

{48647}{48774}According to your bylaws,|you have to take us on a 60-day trial basis.
{48786}{48849}- I beg your pardon?|- According to your bylaws...
{48851}{49001}He's right, UN. Any group that petitions|can become a probationary Tri-Lamb chapter.
{49003}{49053}May I see that, please?
{49104}{49149}Thank you.
{49302}{49399}Well, gentlemen...|you are now probationary Tri-Lambs.

{51482}{51563}And I know just what to do.
{51565}{51602}Come here.
{51702}{51846}We'll put the bar here, the hors d'oeuvres|over there, and we'll pass the cheese puffs.
{51848}{51896}- Oh, good.|- That sounds expensive.
{51898}{52008}This party's important. If we don't impress|the Tri-Lambs, we'll never get in.
{52010}{52114}- Maybe we can have robster craws.|- What the fuck are "robster craws"?
{52116}{52201}- Have any of you got dates, besides Gilbert?|- I do.

{76472}{76595}I'm tired of watching 'em brush their teeth.|See if Betty's up. Dooley, throw me a beer.
{76609}{76654}Thanks.
{76670}{76747}Oh, I getting tired of Betty.
{76749}{76800}Are you kidding? Zoom in.
{76838}{76949}I could never get tired of Betty. How could|you ever get tired of that ass, Takashi?
{76951}{77019}Oh, I see your point.
{77079}{77134}Are you guys still watching the Pis?
{77136}{77194}- (all) Yes.|- Have you been up all night?
{77196}{77232}Yes.
{77234}{77331}- Wormser, haven't you had enough?|- No.
{77356}{77423}(Lewis) I think we got even with the Pis.
{77425}{77508}Now we got a little score to settle|with the Alpha Betas.
{77510}{77575}(braying laugh)
{77657}{77735}- Shit! Hank, what is that stuff?|- Liquid Heat.
{77737}{77845}- It burns.|- You ought to feel it when I don't dilute it.
{77991}{78041}(Toshiro) Get them.
{78093}{78143}Make a pile here.
{78292}{78350}(Toshiro) OK. Here goes.
{78416}{78466}OK. Don't touch, now.
{78502}{78596}- (Gilbert) Here, hit this one.|- (Toshiro) OK. Looks like salad.
{78637}{78699}The key to each season is homecoming.
{78724}{78819}You win that one,|you got your alumni support.
{78821}{78903}You got your alumni support,|you get that jock dorm,
{78905}{78980}you get the laundry money,|you get the new cars.
{78998}{79121}Now, this season started out fine -|we won some big ball games.
{79123}{79179}But we were lucky.
{79181}{79272}We can't get soft.|We can't sit back on our laurels.
{79274}{79352}We win homecoming, we take league.
{79354}{79427}We take league, we get a bowl bid.
{79429}{79488}It's as simple as that.
{79490}{79571}But, gentlemen, you have got to want it.
{79588}{79647}- Do you want it?|- (jocks yell) Yeah!
{79649}{79703}- I can't hear you.|- Yeah!
{79705}{79780}We can't let up. We gotta stay tough.
{79799}{79915}You can do it. You can do it.
{79917}{79988}You gotta believe that you can do it!
{80023}{80100}- You gotta let them know that you want it!|- I want it!
{80102}{80147}- Good.|- (groans)
{80149}{80199}Shower up!
{80201}{80263}(jocks groan in pain)
{80288}{80348}Shit. We forgot to practise.
{80386}{80463}- You put what?|- (Gilbert) Liquid Heat.
{80465}{80540}- On their what?|- In their jocks.
{80542}{80606}- That's outrageous.|- Are you angry, UN?
{80640}{80724}No. I'm not angry.
{80726}{80817}I'm glad to see you nerds...|you guys finally fought back.
{80819}{80911}You'd make a fine addition to Tri-Lambda.|I want to welcome you aboard.
{80913}{80972}- Congratulations.|- All right!
{80974}{81074}- You'll tell the guys?|- Oh, I will. (braying laugh)
{81101}{81148}OK, everybody ready?
{81162}{81209}OK, I focus now.
{81211}{81272}I set timer.
{81274}{81354}- Now say "Hi, UN."|- (all) Hi, UN.
{81460}{81553}(Lewis) Well, I'd like to propose|a toast to UN Jefferson,
{81567}{81676}who, in his ultimate wisdom,|chose to accept us
{81678}{81756}into our new fraternity,|Lambda Lambda Lambda.
{81758}{81818}(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda.
{82045}{82158}Before we take this matter to a vote,|I would like it clearly stated in the record...
{82160}{82205}Miss Childs...
{82207}{82323}that the evidence is|overwhelmingly against the Alpha Betas,
{82325}{82396}and I urge that they be found guilty.
{82398}{82448}Point of order.
{82474}{82568}Dean Ulich, I am an Alpha Beta,
{82570}{82634}and I know that no member of my fraternity
{82636}{82747}could have perpetrated such|a callous, heinous act against the nerds...
{82749}{82802}or the Tri-Lambs.
{82804}{82918}Therefore, I feel a vote at this time|would be, shall we say, premature.
{82920}{82974}- Premature?|- Yes.
{82976}{83028}You see, instead,
{83030}{83143}I am going to organise a special,|blue-ribbon, fact-finding commission,
{83145}{83245}made up of myself and... Miss Betty Childs.
{83264}{83326}We will get to the bottom|of this dastardly deed.
{83328}{83429}- Wait a minute, you can't get away with this.|- Oh, no, I'm afraid I can.
{83431}{83553}You see, only the president|of the Greek Council can call a vote.
{83555}{83626}- That's completely unfair.|- This is bullshit!
{83628}{83671}Meeting adjourned.
{83833}{83932}Guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake|as long as Stan Gable is president.
{83934}{84022}The only way to become president|is to win the homecoming carnival.
{84024}{84121}That's right, Arnold. And that's|exactly what we're gonna do.
{84129}{84174}(fanfare)
{84219}{84380}I take great pleasure in officially opening|this year's homecoming carnival.
{84382}{84439}(cheering)
{84579}{84710}(Dean) The overall winner|will be determined by total points from:
{84712}{84778}number one - field events,
{84780}{84864}number two - the charity fund-raising booth,
{84866}{84981}and number three -|the musical show and skit competition.
{84983}{85070}And now, let the games begin!
{85072}{85152}(cheering and fanfare)
{85301}{85415}OK. The object of the race|is to complete 20 laps around the track,
{85417}{85493}while stopping every lap|for a mandatory pit stop,
{85495}{85564}at which time the driver will chug a beer.
{85589}{85644}You don't have a fucking chance, nerd.
{85646}{85733}- Oh, thank you. Good luck to you, too, Burke.|- Fuck off.
{85743}{85810}Gentlemen, start your engines.

{85851}{85899}(# "Daisy, Daisy")
{86297}{86417}This is trichloromethalene. It counters|all effects of alcohol in your system.
{86435}{86512}- Drink the whole beer.|- (Stan) Go! Go! C'mon, Danny!
{86514}{86568}You got 'em! Kick his ass!
{86570}{86636}Go! Go! Go! Go!
{86880}{86939}- OK, OK.C'mon.|- Are you feelin' OK?
{86941}{87006}- Oh, fucking great!|- Go! Go! Go!
{87133}{87180}Come on, baby! Yeah!
{87290}{87320}Come on!
{87322}{87389}- One more lap.|- It's just you and the Alpha Betas.
{87391}{87484}- Danny, let that nerd beat you, you're nothin'!|- No sweat.
{87486}{87564}- He no stand no chance now.|- Go, Takashi!
{87566}{87623}Go on! Let's go, Burke!
{87625}{87668}Oh, no!
{87686}{87741}All right! Come on! Go!
{87752}{87801}(Ogre) Ah, man, he's wasted!
{87803}{87880}(# "Daisy, Daisy" sung in Japanese)
{87963}{88036}(Stan) Come on, Burke! You're an Alpha Beta!
{88200}{88250}Oh, I won!
{88409}{88504}Times are changin', Betty.|These nerds are a threat to our way of life.
{88506}{88590}If they win homecoming,|they'll take over the Greek Council.
{88592}{88656}And we'll be up to our necks in nerd shit!
{88740}{88838}(Dean on PA) Our next competition|will be the Trojan Horse.
{88840}{88898}(# overture from "William Tell"|by Rossini)
{88979}{89045}C'mon! Get off! Get off!
{89083}{89129}- Ow!|- Yeah!
{89131}{89200}What are those Alpha Betas doing?
{90313}{90383}(booing and jeering)
{90508}{90558}(cheering)
{90690}{90760}(crowd chant) Ogre! Ogre! Ogre!
{91331}{91363}(weeps)
{91376}{91434}(Coach) On your mark. Set.
{91457}{91507}(whistle)
{91693}{91742}(Coach chuckles)
{91744}{91817}(cheerleaders chant) Ooh, ah, Alpha Beta!
{91819}{91847}Ooh, ah...
{91849}{91911}(Coach) On your mark. Set.
{91928}{91975}(whistle)
{92049}{92109}You win.
{92236}{92296}(Dean chuckles)
{92447}{92582}I'm not too wild about this next event,|but it has become a tradition here at Adams.
{92584}{92623}The belching contest.
{92662}{92760}Our first of two finalists,|Frederick W Polowoski.
{92815}{92865}Ogre You Asshole.
{92884}{92929}Ogre.
{93044}{93107}(belches loudly and long)
{93109}{93173}(cheering and applause)
{93439}{93548}And, from the Lambda-Mu team,|Dudley Dawson.
{93550}{93600}- Booger.|- Booger.
{93774}{93844}(belches louder and longer)
{94202}{94339}Our next event goes all the way back to|the Peloponnesian War - the javelin throw.
{95234}{95299}- All right, baby!|- What did you expect?
{95301}{95362}You won it.
{95364}{95414}(laughter)
{95496}{95564}- (Gilbert) Wait for Lamar's throw.|- (Judy) How come?
{95566}{95655}Wormser's a master at aerodynamics.|He designed the javelin to fit
{95657}{95719}with Lamar's limp-wristed throwing style.
{95772}{95847}(# parody of music from "Chariots of Fire")
{96413}{96473}Wormser, it worked!
{96475}{96530}I can't believe it. Did you see that?
{96703}{96753}I love you all. I love you all.
{96755}{96805}Thank you. Thank you.
{96923}{97047}(Dean on PA) The Alpha Beta-Pi team leads.|The Lambda-Mus are a surprising second.
{97049}{97136}Now let's see what happens|at the charity fund-raising booths.
{97138}{97204}Eat a Pi for charity. C'mon, let's go!
{97381}{97431}Take a break, Chip.

{101267}{101369}There's something fishy about these pies.|C'mon, let's go check it out.
{101545}{101659}This can't be. Ogre, go get a pie.|Find out what the hell's goin' on here.
{101744}{101804}Thanks, wimp. Get yourself one.
