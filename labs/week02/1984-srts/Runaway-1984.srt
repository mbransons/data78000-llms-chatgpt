1
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,155
<i>Sergeant ramsay, line 2232.</i>

2
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,584
<i>Sergeant ramsay, line 2232, please.</i>

3
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,727
- They want me.
- I've got this.

4
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,864
Ramsay. What's the model?

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,068
7799 agricultural?

6
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,132
- Ramsay?
- What location?

7
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,672
- This is marvin. Officer thompson.
- Nice to meet you.

8
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,607
That's ramsay, your partner.

9
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,315
Your new partner. Good luck with him.

10
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,847
- Jack ramsay.
- Karen thompson.

11
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,985
- I'm on my way.
- A runaway, jack?

12
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,552
- Yeah. Can you order us a copter?
- Yeah.

13
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,222
- Come on, partner.
- Now?

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,323
If you're gonna keep up,
you gotta move.

15
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,788
Give me the pad.

16
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,723
I need a chopper for ramsay.

17
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,633
You'll need your gloves
and standard pro-gs.

18
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,268
Standard pro-gs?

19
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,870
- What was your last assignment?
- Traffic.

20
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,199
Did you like it?

21
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,875
Working with you is
a step up from traffic.

22
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,169
Maybe.

23
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,071
You know anything about
robotics and computers?

24
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,304
A little.

25
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,539
Basics.

26
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,249
I was gonna be a data programmer.
Do we need all this to...?

27
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,615
- Jack, your copter's on the pad.
- Great.

28
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,256
Let's go, partner.

29
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,060
Is that it?

30
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:59,668
Standard agricultural model
7799 pest controller.

31
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,868
Cpu is an old 8088.

32
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,167
- Any armament?
- Just a claw.

33
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,470
It's only programmed to look
for things smaller than an inch.

34
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,379
Could be a problem.

35
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,454
You may not need all that.
You may just have to throw a switch.

36
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,120
That's all?

37
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,156
Well, you never know
until you get there.

38
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,192
I guess you've been doing this
for a while?

39
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,195
Yeah, a couple of years.
It's interesting work.

40
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,026
Dave, how far away are we?

41
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,761
Should be almost there.
Let's have a look.

42
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,201
Right up there, jack.

43
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,554
What do you know?

44
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,729
It's a clear runaway track
in the field to the left.

45
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,199
You okay?

46
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,631
Yeah, i'm fine.

47
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,771
I just don't like heights.

48
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,305
My brother has the same problem.
Take deep breaths.

49
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,510
I'm fine.

50
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,803
Dave, can you land this sucker?

51
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,774
Put on your gloves.

52
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,460
They sure took long enough
to get here.

53
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,000
- What's the problem?
- That thing's running a zigzag course.

54
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,176
I'm not going in that field after it.

55
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,470
Fuel cells will blow up
in your face.

56
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,181
You go on and take a look.

57
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,349
- Have you had it serviced?
- Regular.

58
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,248
Isn't that what you're getting
paid for? You skedaddle in there.

59
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,830
Oh, there you are.

60
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,640
I seen that coming.

61
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,215
You okay? Let's get him.

62
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,225
World war iii!

63
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,621
I think they got it.

64
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,031
I could've done the same thing
with my.22.

65
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,225
We could've blown the damn thing up.

66
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,164
- It's all yours, fellas.
- Thanks a lot.

67
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,506
How long you say
you've been doing this?

68
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,206
I just sort of fell into it
by accident.

69
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:34,144
I kind of liked it, so i took
some night courses in robotics, apl.

70
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,221
All of a sudden, i just seemed to
know more about it than anybody else.

71
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,521
You ever wanna work
the regular force?

72
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,819
This is the regular force.

73
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,322
You mean working the streets?
I did that. I had to stop.

74
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,931
Because of vertigo?

75
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,830
I don't like heights.
I've had it all my life.

76
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,963
Anyway, i just decided
it wasn't a good idea...

77
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,301
...to work the streets
with that kind of fear.

78
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,344
You wouldn't run into
a situation like that very often.

79
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,846
- You could work the streets...
- i decided i'd rather do this.

80
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,449
Hey, jack, lois called.

81
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,948
- Leave a message?
- Nope.

82
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,382
- Can you call her back?
- Sure.

83
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,865
Lois?

84
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,665
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,907
Whatever you wanna fix is fine.

86
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,941
Oh, that sounds good.

87
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,215
I won't be late.

88
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,414
Okay, bye.

89
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,627
- Why did jack quit the regular force?
- Why'd he quit, marvin?

90
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,356
What'd he tell you?

91
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,897
Because of vertigo,
but i don't believe him.

92
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,462
Well, it's true, in a way.

93
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,733
A few years back,
jack was chasing this guy. Bad guy.

94
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,841
The guy ran into a building
that was under construction.

95
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,412
Jack freaked out, started sweating.

96
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,016
Couldn't follow him.
The guy got away.

97
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,344
So a guy got away.

98
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,654
Later that night
that same guy killed six people.

99
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,052
A family up in ridgemont.

100
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,262
- But that isn't jack's fault.
- Yeah, i know.

101
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,192
He can't blame himself for that.

102
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,763
Yeah, well, he does.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,901
It's always on his mind.
The guy that got away...

104
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,071
...that jack let get away.

105
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,170
He never wants to let anybody
get away from him again.

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,639
Is that why he's a robot expert?

107
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,540
I think he feels a lot safer
doing this work.

108
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,409
Now, why do you do
what you do?

109
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,448
Oh, long story.
I was gonna be a dancer...

110
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,745
...but i hurt my knee.

111
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,047
Then i was gonna be
a data programmer...

112
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,316
...but i didn't like sitting down.
Then i started...

113
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,221
<i>runaway 2, we have a 709 alert.</i>

114
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,020
- To the police academy.

115
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,255
<i>Runaway 2, we have a 709 alert.</i>

116
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,435
<i>Runaway 2, runaway 2,</i>
<i>we have a 709 at fifth and sumter.</i>

117
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,069
What's a 709?

118
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,704
It means people have died.

119
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,339
Oh, god!

120
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,860
- Hey, jack.
- What's up?

121
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,297
A model 912 cut up two people inside,
wife and her sister.

122
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,937
Bodies are over here. They managed
to run out before they died.

123
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,109
- Anything else?
- There's a 10-month-old kid inside.

124
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,244
- Dead?
- No. The kid's in a crib.

125
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,108
Maybe that's why,
but it hasn't touched the kid yet.

126
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,243
- We gotta save that kid, jack.
- Tell me.

127
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,860
What was the weapon?

128
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,120
Pathologist said it was probably
an ordinary kitchen knife.

129
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,264
We kept them for you to see.

130
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,264
Let's get them out of here,
or they'll be on the news.

131
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,435
What've you done?

132
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,367
Power cut, white light bath,
white sound bath.

133
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,403
- Floater?
- No.

134
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,575
- Can you prep one for me?
- Right now.

135
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,072
What have you got on the 912?

136
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,006
It's a new domestic model.

137
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,772
Does housework, cooks meals,
answers doors.

138
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,984
- Run on house current?
- Batteries.

139
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,310
What kind of sensors?

140
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,578
Sees and hears everything.

141
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,852
Great.

142
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,222
- Is it standard?
- May be modified.

143
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,292
Anytime you change them,
who knows how they'll behave?

144
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,993
The father's over there.
Electronic engineer, name of johnson.

145
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,769
- You got that floater yet?
- We're programming it now.

146
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,939
We'd like a direct feed
off your floater.

147
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:51,007
- That's impossible.
- The public has a right to know.

148
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,268
We got a 10-month-old baby in there.

149
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,139
The rest of the family's
been cut up...

150
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,316
...and we don't know if
the 912 will attack the child.

151
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,543
I'm sure you don't want
a carved-up baby on your network.

152
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,880
We can be the judge
of what's newsworthy.

153
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,091
Yeah, i know. Not tonight.

154
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,456
The first confirmation from
sgt. Ramsay of runaway...

155
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,187
...that there is a baby inside,
still alive.

156
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,559
Police are preparing
a floater camera...

157
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,430
...to enter the house to locate
the runaway 912 and the infant.

158
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,901
I can't see.
Lights on in the house.

159
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,626
Hit the house lights.

160
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,832
- Where's the baby?
- In the playroom, near the back.

161
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,408
How big's this 912, anyway?

162
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,668
About the size of a hatbox.

163
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,310
- Look.
- It dropped the knife.

164
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,310
Maybe the battery power's fading.

165
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,811
Maybe.

166
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,298
- You get an audio?
- Confirmed as a.357 magnum.

167
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,130
- The bastard's got a gun.
- Now what?

168
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,836
- I'm going in.
- We can send a disarm robot in.

169
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:31,008
It hit the floater, it'll hit
the disarm, and it'll hit the kid.

170
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,804
I want light lines out here.
No audio, no radio, no nothing.

171
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,015
I don't want it to know
what we're doing.

172
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,945
Mr. Johnson?

173
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,120
Mr. Johnson?

174
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,450
I'll be going in your house soon
to get your baby.

175
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,318
What modifications were made
to the robot?

176
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,596
I didn't make any modifications.
I didn't touch that thing.

177
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,825
Then why has it gone out of control?

178
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,661
Well, how should i know?

179
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,772
You think i should have some idea
why it's doing this?

180
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,839
Take it easy. I'm just asking.

181
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,840
Well, don't ask! I don't know!

182
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,679
What about the gun?

183
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,644
It's got a gun?

184
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,019
- Oh, my god, he's crazy.
- Who's crazy?

185
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,449
- My god, he's crazy.
- Who's crazy?

186
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,749
No television! No pictures!

187
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,517
I won't be on television!
No pictures!

188
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,561
No television!

189
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,094
What was his problem?

190
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,730
Yeah, he was really upset.
That was very hot stuff.

191
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,617
Sgt. Ramsay is wearing
his electromagnetic scatter suit.

192
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,446
He apparently is going in.

193
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,519
What is your next move now?

194
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,157
I really can't say.

195
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,987
It looks as if you're going in
after the robot.

196
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,164
You're broadcasting on an
electromagnetic frequency...

197
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,696
...that the robot reads.

198
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,737
Let's get out of here, john.

199
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,054
This is exciting.
Our own john wilson...

200
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,764
...is accompanying sgt. Ramsay
into the house...

201
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,093
...for exciting live coverage
of the runaway robot.

202
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,044
I'm coming out with the kid.

203
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,956
It's all right, darling.

204
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,123
You okay?

205
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,984
Yeah, i'm fine.

206
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,854
Here you go. Where's the father?

207
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,653
He disappeared.

208
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,796
He disappeared?

209
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,098
With his own kid still in there?

210
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,632
<i>After two tense hours and the</i>
<i>tragic death of a kbex cameraman...</i>

211
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,999
<i>... it was all over</i>
<i>when sgt. Ramsay...</i>

212
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,266
hello?

213
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,302
That was great!

214
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,072
See, they're running it again.
You're on instant replay!

215
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,783
Hi, guy. Bobby, this is karen.

216
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,816
- You're his new partner.
- Nice to meet you, bobby.

217
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,989
I saw you on tv too,
but you didn't go in the house.

218
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,692
Wow! It was neat when
dad went in there.

219
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,760
I'll bet you wished you could
go in there too, huh?

220
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,894
It was pretty scary.
I watched the whole thing.

221
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,691
How come the father ran away?

222
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,766
Didn't he wanna see his baby safe?

223
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,494
We were talking about that.

224
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,331
It seems pretty funny to me.

225
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,700
I think you should...

226
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,140
<i>when you hear the tone,</i>
<i>the time will be 10:45...</i>

227
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,840
<i>... which is exactly one hour</i>
<i>and 45 minutes past your bedtime.</i>

228
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,142
Aw, lois!

229
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,355
<i>This is a weeknight.</i>
<i>Tomorrow is a school day.</i>

230
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,318
- I know, lois, but...
- hey, bobby.

231
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,354
Lois is right. To bed.

232
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,552
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

233
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,764
- Do you like sports?
- Sure.

234
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,465
Bobby, bed.

235
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,962
- Good night, dad.
- Good night.

236
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,429
Good night, bobby.

237
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,133
He is adorable.

238
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,205
- How about a beer?
- Got anything diet? Soda?

239
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,344
<i>I will verify that bobby brushes</i>
<i>his teeth. Excuse me.</i>

240
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,376
So that's lois.

241
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,344
I thought lois was your wife.

242
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,278
Sometimes she thinks she is.

243
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,884
Or my mother.

244
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,051
Do you have a wife?

245
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,322
She died.

246
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,752
Sorry, i didn't know.

247
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,655
It was a couple of years ago.
A car crash.

248
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,890
But lois is a big help.

249
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,756
What is she, a series 10?

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,331
No, a series 12.

251
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,229
Series 12s are much better.

252
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,268
A lot of the series 10s were lemons.

253
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,306
My mom had a series 10 that kept
burning toast. Started fires.

254
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,942
- Lois is pretty reliable.
<i>- Bobby is eating a chocolate bar.</i>

255
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,649
<i>His dinner, too, was</i>
<i>nutritionally inadequate.</i>

256
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,113
- What did you give him?
<i>- Hot dogs.</i>

257
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,153
- You can't keep giving him hot dogs.
<i>- It is all he would accept.</i>

258
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,587
- Did he do his homework?
<i>- Yes, he got an a in math today.</i>

259
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,091
<i>- Will your guest be staying for dinner?</i>
- Me?

260
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,890
- You're welcome if you'd like.
<i>- You are welcome if you would like.</i>

261
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,225
No, thank you.

262
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,459
- It's no trouble.
<i>- It is no trouble.</i>

263
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,830
- Lois, i was talking to her.
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

264
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,331
- Actually, i better go.
- You sure?

265
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,701
Thanks for the juice.

266
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,045
<i>May i show you out?</i>

267
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,509
That's okay, lois.
I can find my way.

268
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,680
Well, see you tomorrow.

269
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,886
<i>- Will i see you tomorrow?</i>
- Lois, she was talking to me.

270
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,952
Excuse me, sergeant.

271
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,315
I'll see you tomorrow.

272
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,525
- Good night.
- Good night.

273
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,896
<i>Is that someone to be put in memory?</i>

274
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,565
Yes. She's my new partner.

275
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,964
<i>- How should she be listed?</i>
- As karen. Or officer thompson.

276
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,603
<i>Very well.</i>

277
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,366
<i>There is a power surge</i>
<i>from bobby's room.</i>

278
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,541
I'll handle it.

279
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,440
<i>The next dinosaur giant is</i>
<i>brontosaurus, "thunder lizard."</i>

280
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,116
<i>Like the other two giants,</i>
<i>she's a peace-loving plant-eater.</i>

281
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,718
<i>She is not as heavy as</i>
<i>the brachiosaurus, but she does...</i>

282
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,754
come on, tiger.

283
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,787
Lights out.

284
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,529
Is she still here?

285
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,323
No, she's gone home.

286
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,501
She's nice. Do you like her?

287
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,260
Well, sure, i like her.

288
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,971
She's my partner.

289
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,867
Does she have a husband?

290
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,433
I don't know.

291
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,405
She didn't have a ring on.

292
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,203
You noticed, huh?

293
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,412
It wouldn't kill you
to marry again.

294
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,708
I know, and it wouldn't kill you...

295
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,646
...to go to sleep.

296
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,251
Come on, tiger.

297
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,282
- Hey, dad?
- What?

298
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,821
Were you really scared in there?

299
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,957
Sure i was.

300
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,720
Was there blood and stuff like that?

301
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,061
Were you really scared?

302
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,395
Me? Not me.

303
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,535
Not even just a little?

304
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,469
Well, a little.

305
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,472
That's okay.

306
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,545
- But everything is fine now.
- That's right.

307
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,376
Everything's fine.

308

Good night, son.

309

Would lois ever go crazy
like that other robot?

310
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,620
No, never.

311
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,124
Sleep now.

312
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,088
Good night.

<i>the menu for tomorrow.</i>

316
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,872
<i>Captain mcnichol, emergency phone call.</i>

317
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,308
- Son of a bitch!
- What is it?

318
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,646
We got a nonstandard chip here.

319
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,821
See that red stripe?

320
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:28,355
It's not a commercial chip.
It didn't come with the robot.

321
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,161
Damn sophisticated, though.

322
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,761
Maybe it's experimental.

323
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,728
- What's it do?
- Looks like hard-wired instructions.

324
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,232
- I'm not sure.
- So the 912 was modified.

325
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,031
- Definitely.
- That guy said it wasn't modified.

326
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,435
Maybe somebody else did it,
and he didn't know.

327
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,074
- We got a dense pack! Floor!
- Floor!

328
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,379
Assholes.

329
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,479
<i>There is a high level of smoke</i>
<i>in the room. Please be careful.</i>

330
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,713
What was that?

331
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,185
Monodichromate dense pack...

332
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,330
...the arson special.
What the hell is this all about?

333
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,394
I don't know.

334
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,531
This isn't a runaway.

335
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,964
This is murder.

336
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,468
Jack, you got a call.
You're gonna love it.

337
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,883
Great.

338
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,322
He said you were gonna love it.

339
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,057
Come on, this way, guys.

340
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,427
Careful.

341
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,594
You have a lot of robots here.

342
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,774
This is nothing. You should see
the construction project over on main.

343
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,843
There aren't any people working there
at all, just hundreds of robots.

344
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,444
No coffee breaks, no union hassles.

345
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,309
So what's the problem?

346
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,009
Stacker.

347
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,583
Gone nuts!

348
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,378
It's stacking where there's
no place to stack.

349
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,191
It's on the 18th floor.
Come on, i'll show you.

350
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,098
Have one of your people shut it off.

351
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,570
Our insurance doesn't cover it.

352
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,101
Looks pretty open.

353
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,677
Robots don't need doors. Come on.

354
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,308
How about i take this one?

355
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,389
Yeah, i think this one's all yours.

356
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,286
No problem. I worked construction
at one time.

357
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:44,951
Of course.

358
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,941
<i>I'm on the 18th floor.</i>

359
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,084
<i>It's pretty windy up here.</i>

360
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,281
<i>I can see the stacker now.</i>
<i>We're looking for...</i>

361
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,189
<i>i found the junction box</i>
<i>but can't find the switch.</i>

362
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,430
<i>I got it! No problem!</i>
<i>I turned it off!</i>

363
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,399
<i>Jack, do you read me?</i>

364
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,003
I got it!

365
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,810
Think it's better than it was
when people did all this work?

366
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,848
Sure.

367
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,244
But machines always break down.

368
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,855
I'll tell you how it is.
Nothing works right.

369
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,287
Relationships and people
don't work right.

370
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,724
People make machines,
so why should machines be perfect?

371
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,454
Because they're machines.

372
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,467
Well, that's not the way it is.

373
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,376
- Hi, sally.
- Hi, jack.

374
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,983
- How's the new car?
- It's in the shop.

375
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,450
You're kidding.
Did you check the door recorder?

376
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,678
No, not yet.

377
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,357
- Is it clean in here?
- Yeah, it's clean.

378
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,265
<i>Hi, mary. It's sally.</i>
<i>I guess you're not home.</i>

379
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,738
<i>I came by to see if you wanted to</i>
<i>go to that ceramics class.</i>

380
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,803
<i>Call me when you get in. Bye.</i>

381
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,377
<i>Hi, dave?</i>

382
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,309
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about our project and...</i>

383
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,046
<i>meet me at the office, will you?</i>
<i>It's important. Really.</i>

384
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,989
<i>This is acme robot repairs.</i>
<i>We got a call...</i>

385
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,853
<i>... that one of your 912s was not</i>
<i>functioning, and i'm...</i>

386
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,128
it's been erased.

387
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,289
Yeah, but not completely.

388
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,237
<i>This is acme robot repairs.</i>
<i>We got a call...</i>

389
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,568
<i>... that one of your 912s was not</i>
<i>functioning, and i'm...</i>

390
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,435
i wanna know who this guy is.

391
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,554
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

392
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,314
I'm glad you're satisfied.

393
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,821
Satisfied?

394
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,153
I'm delighted. I'm ecstatic.

395
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,988
That's good. Good!

396
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,357
Where are the chips?

397
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,970
Be very careful with these chips,
dr. Luther. They're very dangerous.

398
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,470
I know.
That's why they're so valuable.

399
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,406
Valuable to whom?

400
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,977
The mafia, terrorist organizations,
foreign agents.

401
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,308
Anyone who'll offer me the most money.

402
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:53,940
Well, then...

403
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,675
...how about my money?

404
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,347
Harry...

405
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,083
...these aren't all the chips.

406
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,722
And where are the templates
to make more?

407
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,594
The rest of the chips and templates
are locked in a safe.

408
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,828
We'll give you the key
after johnson and i get paid.

409
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,698
Have you seen johnson?

410
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,031
No.

411
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,999
He didn't come in today.

412
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,677
It's terrible,
what happened to his family.

413
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,276
It's a tragedy.

414
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,145
Would you like me to pay now, harry?

415
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,183
I really would.

416
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,786
I thought so.
I brought the money with me.

417
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,017
Sentry, on rounds!

418
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,167
Dr. Luther?

419
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,751
Damned, evil son of a bitch!

420
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,474
- He's still in there?
- Came an hour ago.

421
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,016
I bet he's the only
electrical engineer there.

422
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,916
- What room?
- 404. fourth floor.

423
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,319
Coffee, black.

424
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,564
Keep an eye on the elevator.

425
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,382
Police!

426
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,352
Drop it, johnson!

427
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,053
Now!

428
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,959
You are the cops.

429
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,998
Who were you expecting?

430
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,227
Nobody.

431
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,442
You got a suitcase packed.
You got an alarm and a gun.

432
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,166
You got a permit for this?

433
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,700
Come on.

434
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,438
What are you gonna do?

435
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,945
Take you to the station
for questioning.

436
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,342
Sorry.

437
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,983
Is this about the robot?

438
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,190
Yeah, it's about the robot.
Come on.

439
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,160
- I can't go out there.
- Why not?

440
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,161
- I can't go!
- Sure you can.

441
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,095
I can't go out...!

442
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,613
Dispatch, this is runaway 2!

443
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,793
What the hell are you trying to do?
Come here.

444
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,059
We're the police!

445
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,935
He had different eyes, hm?
Is that him?

446
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,371
Face was narrower.

447
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,965
The eyes were squintier.

448
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,273
More like that?

449
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,874
Pretty close.

450
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,275
That's a lot like him.

451
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,348
That's good.

452
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,213
Jesus!

453
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:46,134
It's picking up diphenyl compounds
and tetrahydrocarbons.

454
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,100
Tetras are explosive and diphenyls
are solid propellant...

455
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,864
...like they use in rockets.

456
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,378
How big did you say
these missiles were?

457
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,907
About that big.

458
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,842
And they went around corners?

459
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,506
Who was this guy?

460
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,549
His name's johnson,
electronic engineer.

461
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,113
- Where did he work?
- A company called vectrocon.

462
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,553
<i>Welcome to vectrocon</i>
<i>security systems.</i>

463
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,627
<i>A retinal identification check is</i>
<i>required to proceed.</i>

464
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,901
<i>Retinal identification is</i>
<i>now being carried out.</i>

465
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,296
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

466
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,397
<i>Retinal identification is</i>
<i>now confirmed.</i>

467
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,109
<i>How can we help you?</i>

468
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,436
I need data files.

469
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,202
<i>Data files for what person?</i>

470
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,641
Employee david johnson.

471
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,872
<i>One moment.</i>
<i>I will search the records.</i>

472
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,677
That's a pretty good voice.
What is it, a 5590?

473
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,287
Yeah, it's a 5590 processor,
but with a z-77 phonetic rom.

474
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,150
Gives it that lifelike tone.

475
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,757
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>

476
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,326
<i>David "dave" johnson is 32 years old.</i>

477
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,554
<i>He has been with the company</i>
<i>four years.</i>

478
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,426
<i>A graduate</i>
<i>in electronic engineering.</i>

479
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,533
<i>He has worked on several projects:</i>

480
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,603
<i>The vectrocon security system,</i>
<i>the phantom missile...</i>

481
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,899
<i>... and a laser-guided</i>
<i>smart bomb.</i>

482
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,009
<i>For the past year, he has worked</i>
<i>in special projects.</i>

483
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,214
<i>Dave enjoys skiing,</i>
<i>biking and water sports.</i>

484
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,575
- It's a standard pr bio.
- What'd you expect?

485
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,115
- It's no good to me.
<i>- It's what you requested.</i>

486
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,183
What do you wanna know?

487
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,685
This vectrocon security project.
What about that?

488
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,391
<i>- That information is classified.</i>
- Keep quiet.

489
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,186
<i>- Do you wish to disconnect?</i>
- How do i find out?

490
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,125
- We have a call.
- Have another unit take it.

491
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,162
Yeah, but our call is right here.

492
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,698
- On my way.
- In this building?

493
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,870
You wanna handle this?
It seems like we got a runaway.

494
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:39,345
All right!

495
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,882
<i>Hello?</i>

496
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,222
<i>Anybody there?</i>

497
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,856
Who is she?

498
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,861
Jackie rogers, one of
the executive secretaries.

499
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,263
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?!</i>

500
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,797
We hear you, miss rogers.
This is sergeant ramsay.

501
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,476
<i>Will you guys get me out?</i>
<i>This damn robot won't let me pass.</i>

502
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,770
<i>He's zapped me twice.</i>
<i>Can you see that?</i>

503
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,380
You just sit tight, miss rogers.
She's very attractive.

504
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,411
- Should she be in there?
- Maybe she's working late.

505
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,483
Let's see the runaway.

506
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,022
A 577 sentry?

507
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,920
Yeah, 577 with office-checking
routines onboard.

508
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,157
Got it. Insulated wheels, steel hull.

509
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,593
- Delivers taser shocks only?
- Standard issue.

510
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,064
We don't modify them.
We run them as they come.

511
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,396
Supposed to voice-inactivate
with a code.

512
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,071
Do you know the code?

513
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,704
Sentry. Input. Vetro.

514
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,412
Zip off. 891. clipper.

515
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,581
<i>I've already tried that.</i>
<i>It isn't responding.</i>

516
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,478
With these sentries,
the temperatures get too high...

517
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,347
...and they pop their chips
right off the motherboard.

518
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,523
<i>Would you guys please do something?</i>

519
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,392
All this thing can do is
deliver shocks? What level?

520
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,995
Sting level only.
Irritating, but it can hurt.

521
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,597
No bio, cardiac, nothing.

522
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,427
Want me to get
the insulation and padding?

523
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,137
- Are you sure?
- I'll knock this baby off quick.

524
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,808
Miss rogers, this is sergeant ramsay.
I'll be right with you.

525
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,339
You just sit tight.

526
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,771
<i>Thank you.</i>

527
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,913
I thought you got armed before
you went up against a runaway.

528
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,575
I think he's in love.

529
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,426
You just stay put, miss rogers.

530
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,157
This will only take a minute.

531
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,767
Better watch out for him.

532
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,565
I think i know what i'm doing.

533
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,969
<i>It's set for stun, not sting level.</i>

534
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,475
I noticed.

535
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,148
<i>- Want the padding now?</i>
- No.

536
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,755
Are you all right, sergeant?

537
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:09,795
I'm fine.

538
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,655
- Is this the way you usually do it?
- Sure.

539
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,012
What are you doing?

540
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,889
You didn't have to do that!

541
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,650
Judgment call.

542
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,829
It was a new jacket.

543
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,032
Yeah, but the sentry's ruined.
I'll have to report this.

544
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,758
If i find there's any irregularities...

545
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,495
...we'll shut down all your machinery
as hazardous for 60 days.

546
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,901
- Are you okay, miss rogers?
- I'm fine.

547
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,872
- I'll just see you to the door.
- No, it's fine.

548
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,080
- I insist.
- You've done enough.

549
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,077
It's my duty. Here you are...

550
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,943
...working late all by yourself.

551
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,448
- I just had to finish up.
- I insist.

552
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,552
- Let me help you.
- No, really...

553
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,164
- what's this?
- It's not my fault.

554
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,594
- He made me get them from the vault.
- Who?

555
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,630
Luther.

556
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,066
They're his chips! I don't have
anything to do with this.

557
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,002
He said he would kill me if
i didn't get them tonight!

558
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,539
He would kill me the way...

559
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,474
...he killed johnson and the others.
He's evil, i'm telling you!

560
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,908
Where's this luther now?

561
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,080
- A meeting.
- What meeting?

562
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,980
- I don't know! I'm not involved...
- where is he?!

563
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,653
The ritz hotel.

564
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,332
<i>Ritz hotel.</i>

565
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,898
The presidential suite.

566
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,830
Two guys with him and two girls.

567
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,507
They've got an evs scrambler on,
so we can't hear or see shit.

568
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,935
Where exactly are they?

569
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,509
Can't determine where without
a probe, and they'll pick that up.

570
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,839
- You using passives only?
- Passives only.

571
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,813
- All the exits and elevators covered?
- We don't have enough people.

572
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,188
This guy's a killer.
I'm not gonna let him get away.

573
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,552
Something's going on in there.

574
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,350
- I better go in.
- You taking responsibility?

575
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,855
You okay about this?

576
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,760
- Yeah, fine.
- You sure?

577
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,367
It's more interesting than traffic.

578
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,733
I'm gonna go in first
and when you hear me...

579
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,168
...you come in.

580
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,648
Honey, did i leave my purse out there?

581
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,588
Did i leave my purse out there or not?

582
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,098
Are you listening to me?

583
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,092
He's not even there.

584
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,910
Don't shoot, please.
Please don't shoot.

585
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:15,941
Come on, now.

586
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:18,505
Nobody move.

587
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,114
Nobody move.

588
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:25,087
Just stay cool.
Everything's gonna be fine.

589
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,347
You said there wouldn't be trouble.

590
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:28,387
Nobody move.

591
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,253
Right here.

592
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,796
Okay, let's take it easy.

593
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:38,195
Everybody move real slow,
and we won't have any trouble.

594
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,476
Drop it, sucker.

595
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,085
I said, "drop your gun."

596
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,324
I'm not kidding, asshole.

597
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,396
Drop your gun.

598
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,426
Please.

599
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,447
Now kiss your ass goodbye!

600
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,626
Police! Hold it!

601
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,796
I'm okay. Get him.

602
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,400
- Where?
- The stairs!

603
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,434
Officer down, inside.
Call for backup.

604
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,651
<i>They're on the roof!</i>

605
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,784
It's all right. It's all right.

606
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,253
You're okay.

607
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,169
The coroner's office has authorized
the removal of the bodies.

608
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,271
- Come on.
- She's a witness, billy.

609
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,371
- Sergeant, may we have a word with you?
- Go away.

610
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:03,909
Later.

611
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,341
I want to talk to you.

612
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,339
Chief, any further comment?

613
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,916
No, there's no comment right now.

614
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,049
- How is it, kid?
- Fine.

615
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,484
Didn't even break any bones.

616
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:18,487
I'm going to the hospital.
They'll take the bullet out there.

617
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,559
Take it out there?

618
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,094
That's right, in case
she starts bleeding.

619
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,890
But you can't move her.

620
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:24,930
Hold on a minute.

621
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,533
Come here.

622
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,070
Take a look at that screen again.
That's not a bullet.

623
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,574
It's an unexploded microshell.
It can go off anytime.

624
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,474
- It can blow her whole arm off...
- that's right.

625
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,047
You gotta take it out here.
Don't move her.

626
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,480
- The chief wants your ass.
- I know.

627
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,993
Just sit tight.
It's gonna be fine.

628
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,661
I'm trying not to breathe.

629
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,158
You do that.

630
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,804
Look at this. Look.

631
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,737
Those two dead hoods?
We got a make off the prints.

632
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,140
Tommy aracaro, degree in
electrical engineering, cal tech.

633
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,574
- Great.
- And...

634
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,716
...luigi bandini, degree in
solid state physics, m.i.t.

635
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,285
These guys are high-tech shoppers.
But what are they buying?

636
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,420
Good question.

637
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,180
Now, ramsay!

638
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,185
Get over here, ramsay.

639
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,794
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- It's my operation.

640
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,968
It's a runaway operation?
No runaways in that room.

641
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:36,695
You screwed up good. We've got
two dead officers, understand?

642
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,407
Two dead cops!

643
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,735
Two wounded, one of them
your own partner.

644
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,775
We got two dead guinea punks!

645
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,379
And nobody knows what it's all about!

646
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,981
I know what it's about.
It's about this.

647
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,014
What is this?

648
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,914
It's some kind of new bullet,
like a guided missile.

649
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,124
It can go...
what the hell is this?!

650
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,554
Disarm robot.
There's an unexploded fragment.

651
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,557
You can't use that thing on her!

652
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,264
- They sent for it.
- They screw up all the time.

653
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,060
- We have to. It's a live shell.
- It'll screw up!

654
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,128
It'll blow her arm off.

655
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,670
- Can't you get a cvd?
- There's none available.

656
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,603
It's over a year old and,
they were never any good!

657
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,335
Jesus christ, you've got
nerve to complain!

658
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,980
Haven't you done enough for one day?

659
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,645
- I'll get the bullet out.
- You?

660
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,514
I'll disarm the goddamn bullet.
Get it out of here!

661
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,088
All right, clear out.
We've got a disarm job.

662
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,816
Clear out!
Can you get them to clear out?

663
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,723
I want tensolite shields!
I want blast pads!

664
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,898
I want to clear the fucking room now!

665
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,691
Ramsay! You're on television.

666
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,801
I don't give a shit.
Get that thing out of my face.

667
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,437
Get out. Clear it out!

668
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,266
Ladies, i'll give you
a statement down here.

669
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,999
Let's go. Get out!

670
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,142
Yes, i will give
the public a statement.

671
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:57,977
What's this?

672
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,279
Remote tv.

673
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,820
<i>Of course.</i>

674
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,720
<i>Okay, guys, let's clear out.</i>

675
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,827
Better get away from the door.

676
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,049
- How we doing, kid?
- Okay.

677
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,451
I heard the news.

678
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,283
Well, don't sweat it.

679
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,561
You don't have to do this.

680
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,461
Yeah, i know.

681
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,998
- You can let the robot do it.
- I wouldn't miss this for the world.

682
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,136
Just hold real still.

683
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,211
- Too tight?
- No, it's okay.

684
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,593
I want you to sit back
and take it real easy.

685
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,796
It'll hurt like a mother.

686
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,840
Just real easy.
Just turn your arm.

687
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,807
Real slow. That's it.

688
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,507
That's good.

689
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,505
Okay, whatever you do...

690
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:35,944
...don't move your arm.

691
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,883
I'll try and remember.

692
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,687
Don't you need your glasses for this?

693
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,795
Want me to run to the car
and get them?

694
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,472
Breathe it, kid.

695
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,573
Hold still!

696
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,601
Come on kid, breathe it.

697
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,445
That's it. Just keep breathing.
Hold still.

698
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,311
That's it.

699
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,878
Come on, kid.

700
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,179
Breathe it. That's it.

701
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,584
Easy.

702
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,361
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

703
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,571
Can't you do anything right?

704
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,329
I'm doing the best i can.

705
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,039
This thing's gonna be okay.

706
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,075
Heard any jokes lately?

707
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:39,878
Come on, kid.

708
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,876
Hold on. Come on, hold still.

709
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,217
Breathe it.

710
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,786
I can see it.

711
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,049
Come on.

712
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,727
I can see it.

713
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:54,428
It's almost there.

714
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,256
Come on.

715
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,027
There!

716
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,078
It's okay.

717
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,591
You didn't need to wait, jack.
I'm fine.

718
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,528
- I was worried about you.
- I'm fine, really.

719
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,129
- Hurt much?
- No. Not really.

720
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,736
Bet it does.

721
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,133
Jack, i'm fine.

722
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,971
Why don't we have dinner tonight?

723
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,269
Dinner?

724
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,007
Sure. I gotta go home
and change, though.

725
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:48,308
- You can go like that.
- I can't go like this.

726
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,848
We're going to my place.

727
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,324
- We should get to know each other.
- I love it.

728
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:02,026
It's a good idea for partners
to spend time together...

729
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,756
...away from work.
- Definitely. You're right.

730
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,128
We'll go over office routines...

731
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,632
...station procedures.

732
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,237
There's a lot of things
you'll need to know.

733
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,371
The chief isn't the easiest guy
to get along with.

734
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,441
I always take new partners to dinner.

735
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:19,878
Oh, you do?

736
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,515
Just because you're a woman
shouldn't make any difference, right?

737
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,285
Well, listen, i really
appreciate the gesture...

738
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,960
...but i want to go home.
- Why not dinner?

739
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,795
Just forget it.

740
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,515
<i>The pasta will be al dente</i>
<i>in two minutes...</i>

741
00:55:58,755 --> 00:55:59,983
<i>... 17 seconds.</i>

742
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,019
Forget it, lois.

743
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,350
<i>- Where's your dinner guest?</i>
- Forget it.

744
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,582
<i>She forget it?</i>

745
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,422
She didn't forget it.
I'm asking you to forget it.

746
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,894
<i>Very well, i will erase it</i>
<i>from memory.</i>

747
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:10,997
You do that.

748
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,369
<i>Bobby stayed up to say</i>
<i>good night to you.</i>

749
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,704
Dad.

750
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,247
Hi, son.

751
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,078
I saw you on tv.

752
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,217
I know you didn't mean it.

753
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,428
- Mean what?
- What you said.

754
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,063
The words that you said
that you say i can't say.

755
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,996
- Well, you see...
- i know.

756
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,800
You didn't know what you were saying,
because you were worried about her.

757
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,000
Well, that's true.

758
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,404
But that's not an excuse.

759
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,012
- Sometimes...
- just don't let it happen again.

760
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,820
I'll try.

761
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,854
Did she come here tonight?

762
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,730
No, she went home.

763
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,561
<i>Excuse me, sergeant.</i>
<i>They want you at the police station.</i>

764
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,138
I gotta go.

765
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,802
You go to sleep.

766
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,613
- Good night, son.
- Yes, sir.

767
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,547
Good night.

768
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,204
<i>Vehicle recovery on three-six.</i>

769
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:00,967
Look at this.

770
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,974
The back half is solid propellant.

771
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,478
There's directional control.
The nose is electronic.

772
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:10,982
You've heard of a bullet that has your
name on it? This one really does.

773
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,280
- You can program it.
- What's its signature?

774
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:17,220
I don't know. I've tried everything.
Movement, light, shape.

775
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,223
- I gotta know, marvin.
- I know!

776
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,521
I'm doing my best, okay?

777
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,430
It's tricky.

778
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,530
Heat.

779
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:32,736
My god.

780
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:36,211
- A heat-seeking missile.
- They come at a specific person.

781
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,538
Sure.

782
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,147
Everyone's body has its own unique
heat pattern. This is yours...

783
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,783
...and this is mine.

784
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,688
Clean, simple and neat.

785
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,087
This is a police nightmare.

786
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,455
We used to worry about terrorists
getting a-bombs?

787
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,063
The real problem is
microelectronics stuff.

788
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,562
I mean, a smart bullet?

789
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,063
What about these chips?

790
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,262
Overrides all cpu instructions.
Turn any computer into a killer.

791
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,935
Charles luther. This the guy?

792
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,440
Yeah, that's him.

793
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,147
This is a bad guy.

794
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,909
Served one to three, robbery.
Arrest, murder two, no conviction.

795
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:20,782
Arrest for assault with a deadly
weapon, overturned. Mob connections.

796
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,584
He's a rich kid gone bad.
Why's he with johnson?

797
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,761
He got johnson and harry to design
the chips, killed them...

798
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,861
...and ran away with the stuff.

799
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,363
He likes to kill people.

800
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,126
He's killed five so far. I want him.

801
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,405
I'm sure you do.
But how are you going to get him?

802
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,540
We've got his girlfriend.

803
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,212
Whoop-dee-do! You think he's
interested in a piece of ass?

804
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,609
- She's all we've got.
- And she leads nowhere.

805
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,713
I want you to talk to our psychic.

806
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:53,511
Linda's in the building. I'll send
her up here to give you a reading.

807
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,316
- Come on, chief.
- Just do it, ramsay.

808
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,500
Louis...

809
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,209
an old name.

810
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,981
Lucifer.

811
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:22,349
Luther?

812
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,280
Is his name luther?

813
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,755
And you're looking for him.

814
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,825
He's very angry.

815
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,185
Where is he?

816
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,952
I'm not surprised you're
looking for him.

817
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,722
You have a karmic bond.
You were brothers in another life.

818
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:42,131
- Linda...
- your relationship is clear, like...

819
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,203
...pieces in the same puzzle.

820
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,677
You've been close many times,
and you'll get closer.

821
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,936
You'll definitely meet.

822
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,440
When and where?

823
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,316
He'll see to that.

824
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,319
After all...

825
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,723
...you have what he wants.

826
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,954
- I do?
- Of course.

827
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,932
- I work as an exercise instructor.
- Where?

828
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,634
A lot of places.
Look, i got a firm body.

829
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,133
My body's perfect. It's like a rock.

830
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,531
I can see that.

831
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,035
Oh, come on.

832
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,374
He's giving me a hard time.

833
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,635
- He doesn't believe me.
- I can't help.

834
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,141
Weiner-head!

835
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,905
<i>Officer milhop, artist sketch room.</i>

836
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,978
Called you back too, huh?

837
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,148
How are you feeling now?

838
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,920
Hurts, but it's okay.

839
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,422
- Hey, ramsay. Telephone.
- I'm not here.

840
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,459
What's going on?

841
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:46,363
Those illegal chips look like
they were production-etched.

842
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,499
Meaning what?

843
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,965
They were run off
a regular assembly line.

844
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:53,171
- So?
- Somewhere there's photo templates...

845
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,899
...to make more.

846
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,376
Who has the templates?

847
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,638
I don't know. We better find them.

848
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,783
He said he knows you're here.
Do you know a luther?

849
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:14,596
This is ramsay.

850
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,358
<i>You're lucky to be alive.</i>
<i>You should've let the robot disarm it.</i>

851
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:22,594
- So you watch tv. What's on your mind?
<i>- I watch, i look, i listen.</i>

852
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,272
<i>I'm watching you now.</i>

853
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,634
Right. What's on your mind, luther?

854
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:30,471
<i>You're standing by the desk</i>
<i>punching buttons on the console...</i>

855
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,772
<i>... trying to trace this call,</i>
<i>which won't...</i>

856
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:36,314
<i>... do shit, because i'm calling</i>
<i>from a mobile phone.</i>

857
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,383
<i>Now you're looking around.</i>

858
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,419
<i>Now you're cupping your hand</i>
<i>over the receiver.</i>

859
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,784
He's tapped into
the closed-circuit tv.

860
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:48,429
<i>I can't hear what you're saying,</i>
<i>but i've tapped into the tvline.</i>

861
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,562
<i>That wasn't very nice, ramsay.</i>

862
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,131
How'd he do that?

863
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,359
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>how i did that.</i>

864
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,405
- What do you want?
<i>- I want my girl.</i>

865
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:01,208
<i>I know she's there.</i>
<i>I want you to turn her over to me.</i>

866
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,273
No way.

867
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,312
<i>If you don't, i'll kill her.</i>
<i>And then i'll kill you.</i>

868
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,313
<i>You can't run away, ramsay.</i>
<i>I'll find you.</i>

869
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,180
<i>My little machines will</i>
<i>find you wherever you go.</i>

870
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,860
- Why's he want the girl?
- Maybe she has the templates.

871
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,964
- Marvin, can you get me a little bug?
- Yeah, i got it for you.

872
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,269
You were supposed to catch him.

873
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:34,733
And how are you?

874
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,968
- You were supposed to catch him!
- I tried.

875
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,646
Well you didn't, shithead!

876
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,371
I feel bad about it too.

877
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,779
Not half as bad as i do.
You really screwed up.

878
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,488
He got away.
You know where that leaves me?

879
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:47,950
He's smart, you know?

880
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,991
He's gonna know how you found him
at the hotel room because i told.

881
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,219
And he's gonna be so mad...

882
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,965
what am i gonna do now?

883
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,791
- We'll take care of you.
- Sure you will.

884
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,628
We'll move you to a safe place.

885
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,102
You'll move me to a safe place?
And where is that?

886
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,241
There is no safe place.
Not from him.

887
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,036
- Sure there is.
- No, there isn't!

888
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,213
What does it take to get
through to you?!

889
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,939
He sees everything.
He knows everything here.

890
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,744
Do you understand
what i'm saying to you?

891
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,512
Why is he looking for you, jackie?

892
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,127
How do i know?

893
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,996
We better move you.

- Okay, fine.

Hell, no! If we're in cop cars,

Do you know how much they're worth?

982

Luther wants them pretty bad.

- Yeah, he does.
- And i want luther pretty bad.

- He could be anywhere.

That doesn't do us much good, does it?

990
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,425
This is stupid!
You think he's gonna show up here?

991
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,930
He won't.
Let's get out of here.

992

<i>- Two for dinner?</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

This way, please.

1006
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,355
<i>Be cool.</i>

1007
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,730
<i>We don't want any shooting</i>
<i>in a place like this, do we?</i>

1008
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,399
- No.
- Good boy.

1009
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,305
- Just don't get too nervous.
- I won't.

1010
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,098
I beg your pardon, sir?

1011
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:34,832
Nothing. This is fine.

1012
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,410
<i>All right, now give jackie</i>
<i>the templates.</i>

Would you like something from the bar?

1014
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,316
Nothing, thank you.

1015
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:49,255
- I'll be back with the menus.
- Could you give us a few minutes?

1016
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,557
<i>Now send jackie over to me.</i>

1017
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,222
Send thompson first.

1018
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,224
<i>What's the matter, sergeant?</i>
<i>Don't you trust me?</i>

1019
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,329
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>i haven't got all night.</i>

1020
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,430
It's my insurance policy.

1021
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,412
Send thompson.

1022
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,409
<i>At the same time.</i>

1023
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,080
Go ahead, jackie.

1024
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,175
<i>Good bye, darling.</i>

1025
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,839
Sweet dreams.

1026
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,104
<i>Do you think i'm stupid?</i>

1027
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,680
What's the matter?

1028
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,646
These aren't all of them.

1029
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,344
Nobody does that to me.

1030
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:53,520
Nobody!

1031
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,300
So he got away.

1032
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,007
And he stiffed the girl.

1033
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:47,401
- That's right.
- That's good.

1034
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:50,009
That's excellent work. What's next?

1035
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,041
Nothing.

1036
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,975
- Can't screw that up.
- Nothing...

1037
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,183
...because i planted a bug on him.

1038
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,113
- We'll pick it up anytime now.
- You hope.

1039
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:00,718
What is it?

1040
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,584
- They got a signal from the bug.
- Where?

1041
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,123
City hospital. He must have got hurt.

1042
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,425
Got enough people here?
They'll pick you up.

1043
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,463
- Where is he?
- In the john.

1044
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,931
Clear those civilians out. Let's go.

1045
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,000
You stay here.

1046
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,352
Where the hell did he go?

1047
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,783
Sally!

1048
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,177
Congratulations. You just
staked out toilet paper.

1049
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,744
Go through the usual routines.
Maybe we'll find something.

1050
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:03,577
We'd better go.

1051
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,751
You wanna watch the door?

1052
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,083
Sure.

1053
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,277
Where's the chief?

1054
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,619
Where'd you get those idiots
for the stakeout?

1055
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,915
- It was amateur night.
- We blew it.

1056
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,956
I'll say you did.
We should have had him.

1057
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,719
You didn't find him, huh?

1058
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,592
He's good.

1059
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,793
You better look at this.

1060
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,543
Oh, god.

1061
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:18,148
It's busy.

1062
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,885
Bobby!

1063
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,488
Lois?

1064
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,629
What happened?

1065
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,664
Her voice module's broken.

1066
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,100
See if you can patch it.

1067
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,669
Wasn't she watching the door?

1068
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:43,936
Don't try to speak, lois.

1069
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,409
- She's lost hydraulic fluid.
- She's okay...

1070
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:49,082
...if she keeps power to
her memory circuits.

1071
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,776
<i>Bobby.</i>

01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,115
Lois?

1074

<i>Bobby was on the phone when an</i>

1076
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:05,499
<i>He forced bobby to leave with him.</i>

1077

- How long ago?
<i>- My clock's disconnected.</i>

1078
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,537
<i>- I do not know the amount of time.</i>
- Did he say anything?

1079
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:13,468
<i>He left no...</i>

1080

<i>May i show you to the door?</i>

1086
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:31,890
I think that's it.

1087
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,324
- Lois, do an internal diagnostic check.
<i>- Beginning check now.</i>

1088
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,035
What'd you do with my son?

I promise.

1103
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,204
- And you won't call anybody?
- I won't.

1104
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,549
<i>Diagnostic check completed.</i>

1105
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:32,013
<i>There is a malfunction.</i>

1106
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,087
<i>- Please check battery connections.</i>
- Sure.

1107
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,321
<i>Thank you.</i>

1108
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:41,085
- Is this it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1109
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,360
<i>What'd you do with my son?</i>

1110
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,963
<i>Listen, sucker.</i>

1111
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,167
<i>Yeah, i'm listening.</i>

1112
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,859
<i>If you wanna see your boy alive,</i>
<i>bring the other templates.</i>

1113
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,663
<i>Just you alone.</i>

1114
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,373
<i>- No tricks this time.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

1115
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:57,967
<i>Where?</i>

1116
01:21:58,213 --> 01:21:59,578
<i>Go down main street to...</i>

1117
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,715
<i>- right to sentises</i>
<i>construction site.</i>

1118
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,172
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>the spiders won't hurt you!</i>

1119
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,138
<i>Dad? Are you coming to get me?</i>

1120
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,405
<i>Better have the templates this time.</i>

1121
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,412
- I do.
<i>- Drop your gun.</i>

1122
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,651
<i>Now get on the elevator!</i>

1123
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,844
Come on, ramsay!

1124
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:30,860
Let him go. Now!

1125
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,063
Of course.

1126
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,705
Get on the elevator.

1127
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,974
I want to stay with you, dad.

1128
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,611
Get on the elevator, son.

1129
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,212
Push the down button.

1130
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,117
Stay away from the edge!

1131
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:00,417
The templates, ramsay!

1132
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,657
After he's down.

1133
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:04,893
After he's safe.

1134
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:09,794
There's a little problem about that.
I can't have any witnesses.

1135
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:14,873
The spiders have been programmed to
kill the first one off the elevator.

1136
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,974
They'll let you in.

1137
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:19,680
But they won't let you out.
There's nothing you can do!

1138
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,108
Bobby!

1139
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,580
Stop the elevator!
Push the button!

1140
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,410
What's the matter?!

1141
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:27,951
Stop the elevator!
Push the button!

1142
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,018
They don't work!

1143
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,954
None of them work!

1144
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:36,129
You can't stop it.
I fixed the elevator.

1145
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,465
Look on the monitor.
It's a better view.

1146
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,500
Ever see them kill somebody?

1147
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,372
It's really impressive.
They're loaded with acid.

1148
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:08,559
Karen!

1149
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:13,563
Come on, kid.

1150
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,081
You bastard!

1151
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,075
That's good, ramsay.

1152
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,520
But not good enough.

1153
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,113
Enjoy the view?

1154
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,205
It's okay, son.

1155
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:46,745
It's okay.

1156
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:52,288
Thanks.

1157
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:57,760
You all right?

1158
01:33:58,099 --> 01:33:59,464
Yeah, i'm okay.

1159
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,075
You go to the car.

1160
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,043
Tell lois you're all right.

1161
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:37,857
You look awful.

1162
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:44,066
I think i've overcome
my fear of heights.

1163
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:47,602
- Hurt much?
- No, i'll get it taken care of.

1164
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:49,643
How about dinner?

1165
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:54,946
Dinner?

1166
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:56,274
Sure.

1167
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:05,548
Just because you're a woman
shouldn't make a difference, right?

1168
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,294
Right.

1169
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:24,773
Can you cook?

1170
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:27,339
Try me.
