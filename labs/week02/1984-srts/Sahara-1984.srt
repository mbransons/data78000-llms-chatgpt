1
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,008
We're in business.

2
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:16,251
A perfect run, Dale. The best time yet.

3
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,150
What did we do?

4
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,631
-Eighty-six a lap.
-Jesus, we hit 110.

5
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,759
I red-lined the last lap.

6
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,510
Dad, something's popped in the gear-train.

7
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,513
Coming down through third,
it snagged and started to shake.

8
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,224
Oh, no. Maybe you bound a few teeth.

9
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,060
We'll take it apart and look at it.

10
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:39,358
-Well, let me know as soon as you find out.
-You got it!

11
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,610
Did, Mr. Chase say anything yet?

12
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:47,282
No, it's too soon.
Financiers love to play cat and mouse.

13
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,744
Well, the Gordon Packard's
the best investment he'll ever make.

14
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:51,995
Well, we'll know soon enough.

15
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,914
He's coming to the house tonight.

16
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,499
To your party.

17
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,023
To my party?

18
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,919
Thanks a lot for telling me, Dad.

19
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:03,068
You're the hostess. Wear a dress.

20
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,716
Come on, Dale! Come on.

21
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,334
Well, what do you think?

22
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,483
Gorgeous.

23
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,922
-My daughter or the car?
-Both.

24
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,465
I'm not much on words, Mr. Chase.

25
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,634
I put my life into my company.

26
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,637
And you're up to your mudguards in debt.

27
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,807
I've bet everything I've got
on the Gordon Packard.

28
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,559
But you saw it perform.

29
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,811
It's... It's a good car.

30
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,440
It does fine on a nice, flat straightaway.

31
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,026
But what can it do in stress conditions?

32
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,737
Long hauls on flint beds and alkaline,

33
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,489
in brutal temperatures
through dust storms and sand.

34
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,825
That sounds like the Sahara.

35
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,849
It is.

36
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,537
The Sahara World Rally.

37
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,080
There are only five other cars competing,

38
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,166
but each one of them is a legend.

39
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,668
Rolls, Bentley, Saab,

40
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,339
Hispano-Suiza, Alfa Romeo, and Mercedes.

41
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:28,342
Look, you've got a great car, Gordon,

42
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,386
but before I hand you
or anyone a contract worth 60 million,

43
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,097
I want to see
the damn thing race straight through hell.

44
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,121
And win.

45
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,217
Hello.

46
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,097
Mr. Gordon, sir.

47
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,703
What is it, String?

48
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,040
The engine's clean,
but we found metal in the gear train.

49
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:04,189
-I want to tear it down.
-Metal?

50
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:11,385
The engine's fine.
It's the trans that bothers me.

51
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,721
Dale said it felt like a gear slip.

52
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:20,727
In that case, it's not going
to show up until I red-line it.

53
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,938
I'll take it for a spin on the turnpike.

54
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:29,337
Whatever it is,
it'll grind it up and blow it out.

55
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,385
I can do it.

56
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,450
Okay, now, come on. Now you promised.

57
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,370
No, you said that this was easy. Come on.

58
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,019
Now. Come on.

59
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,304
Ewing, what's wrong?

60
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:01,078
Miss Gordon, there's been an accident.

61
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,388
You were right.

62
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,494
It was the transmission.
The wheels locked.

63
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,246
I know, Dad. We'll talk in the morning.

64
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,915
Front left suspension is all torn up.

65
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,814
Dad, please don't talk.

66
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,296
Listen, God damn it,

67
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,466
this is the last time
we'll be seeing each other.

68
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,365
I won't listen.

69
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:38,745
Dale...

70
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,649
The car means everything.

71
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:52,611
My plan for the future, for you,

72
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,635
for the company.

73
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,740
We know it's the best.

74
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:01,203
But the Chase Group wants one last test.

75
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:06,352
An endurance race through desert country.

76
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,399
Sahara World Rally.

77
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,321
We can win it, Dale.

78
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,908
We can win.

79
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,217
It's just that the Sahara is one mean race.

80
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,262
And it was Daddy's dream,

81
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,411
his life.

82
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,558
And now, it's mine.

83
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,393
There's more to it than driving.

84
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,103
Now what's that supposed to mean?

85
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,646
It's just that this race
has been put together

86
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,398
by some very clubby gentlemen

87
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,817
who are awfully picky
about their membership.

88
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,027
They've got rules.

89
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,904
They won't let a woman
drive as far as the starting line.

90
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,532
You see, it's for men only.

91
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,619
So, String thought that, maybe,
since I'm here, I could drive...

92
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,768
Andy, just stop worrying.

93
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,397
Now just look at that!

94
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,237
Isn't that a surprise.

95
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,350
Welcome to Morocco, sir.

96
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,268
The American automobile, it is yours?

97
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,063
Yes. The name's Gordon, Dale Gordon.

98
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,232
The son, of course.

99
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,943
We better look after our pal.

100
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,487
I'm Captain Browne, British contingent.

101
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,073
This is Enrico Bertocelli,
our Italian competitor.

102
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,325
He's a terrific driver,
but he's never won a race yet.

103
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,285
England, you talk too much.

104
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,184
Welcome aboard.

105
00:12:58,863 --> 00:12:59,923
He's young.

106
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,009
His papa beat me once.

107
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,408
Well, who wouldn't?

108
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,308
Forget it, fella.

109
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,518
My God, it's working.

110
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,917
Don't forget to use the men's room.

111
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,406
Where are we? What kind of a place is this?

112
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,784
-Who are those men?
-The Chambra tribe.

113
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:11,912
They came out of the desert
to our town to buy women.

114
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,186
Buy women?

115
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,755
The name's Gordon, Dale Gordon.

116
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,174
I believe you have two rooms reserved
for me and my crew.

117
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,178
I'm terribly sorry, <i>monsieur,</i> but we are full.

118
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,429
But I had reservations.

119
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,223
I am sorry, but there is nothing.

120
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:35,268
Excuse me,
but maybe I can be of some help.

121
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,042
I'm Eric Von Glessing.

122
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,108
I suppose your reservations
may have been canceled

123
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,110
when they learned
of your father's accident.

124
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,236
You knew my father?

125
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,488
Yes, I knew him well.

126
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,782
Well, I guess
we'll have to find other accommodations.

127
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,119
Well, as this is Al Jarida's only hotel,

128
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,037
I believe you have a problem.

129
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,665
But don't worry,
I have a large suite, plenty of room.

130
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:00,961
Concierge, please give Mr. Gordon
my suite, number 23.

131
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,129
Twenty-three.

132
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:04,172
Thank you very much, sir.
It's very considerate of you.

133
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,174
You're more than welcome.

134
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,552
Plus the fact,
I don't want anything to happen to you

135
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,221
before we start to race against each other.

136
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:15,308
Without a bloody car, Von Glessing,
you won't be racing anybody.

137
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,832
His car we call <i>"le mirage."</i>

138
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,858
You know, these fellows are just annoyed

139
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:25,360
that I won't allow them to see my car.

140
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:29,281
A practice, by the way, which your father
understood and respected.

141
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,700
You knew him well, didn't you?

142
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,724
I beat him once.

143
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,832
But it was always the best of worlds
to race against a Gordon.

144
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,981
So, may the best man win.

145
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,455
Gentlemen, welcome to Morocco.

146
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,687
My name is Major Douvain,

147
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,484
military attaché
representing the French government

148
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,569
in the west parts of the Sahara.

149
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,529
Allow me to recommend to you

150
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:17,303
that you forget your so-called Sahara rally
and just go home.

151
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:22,918
Gentlemen, the reason
for the shift in our policy is,

152
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:27,547
a tribal war is about
to break out here in the dunes.

153
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:31,385
North Africa is on the
verge of a tribal war.

154
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,679
How bloody marvelous!

155
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,556
Do you know
what a tribal war is, Mr. Browne?

156
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,017
Well, of course. Everybody does.

157
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,145
Well, then I suggest you
abandon the short route,

158
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,650
as only a car with wings
can cross these impossible dunes.

159
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,903
The long route
will take you nine to ten days.

160
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,865
And just remember,
the short route has only one well,

161
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,660
no petrol dumps, no landmarks,

162
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:00,934
only a tribal war and the Chambra.

163
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,941
-Amen.
-Amen.

164
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:31,945
Good luck.

165
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,779
Good luck to you, too.

166
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,809
Has anyone seen
Von Glessing's second car?

167
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,020
The kraut's probably up
to his dirty tricks again.

168
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,919
Too late to worry about it now.

169
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,974
Quite ready, old boy.

170
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,403
Band, stop.

171
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,228
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
</i>your attention, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

172
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,981
When the cannon fires, the race...

173
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,130
Hey! Hey!

174
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,840
Hey! Hey! Hey!

175
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,052
Hey! Hey!

176
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:39,763
Go!

177
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,139
-Now?
-Now!

178
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,064
A <i>Fräulein</i> he is!

179
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:35,860
You did it!

180
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:41,028
I knew we would! Now let's win the race!

181
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,826
Good Lord! Do you see that?

182
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,591
Fill her up, old chap.

183
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,615
What do you suggest?

184
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,409
The long route.

185
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,912
From here it will take six
or seven days on the long route.

186
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,665
The shortcut will save us three,
maybe four days.

187
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,251
That's not the point.
There's a war out there.

188
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,587
She could get killed.

189
00:21:58,611 --> 00:21:59,880
Who's that?

190
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,779
The Englishman.

191
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:08,531
You want the short route,
turn left at the camels.

192
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:12,059
It's up to you, bon-bon.

193
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,333
You worried about getting shot at?

194
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,744
We've lost the Alfa.

195
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,413
The rest are in front of us.

196
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:39,937
Good. Then nobody
will see us take the short route.

197
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:01,546
This is so beautiful.

198
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,257
I wish Dad were here.

199
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,251
Okay, time to rest.

200
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,545
-What time is it?
-2:30.

201
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,443
Okay, but just until dawn.

202
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:48,467
All right. Andrew. Wake up, lad.

203
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,513
Are we there yet?

204
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,261
What happened?

205
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,763
Gypsies, honey.

206
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,787
Nomads of the desert. Harmless people.

207
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:43,794
They must've been shot
just before we arrived last night.

208
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:47,005
But the map said
that this was the Chambra well.

209
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,049
And they protect the gypsies.

210
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,842
Well, they didn't do much of a job.

211
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,388
Let's just get our water
and beat it out of here.

212
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:57,432
It's four days back to Al Jarida,
two or three to the finish line.

213
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,956
Let's just keep going. Fast.

214
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,168
Dale!

215
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,232
Dum-dum. That means Hamancha.

216
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,567
-The tribal war has started!
-Devil soldiers.

217
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,341
Let's get out of here.

218
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,472
Let's go!

219
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,307
Step on it!

220
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:49,609
Isn't there anything we can do?

221
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,383
Yeah, surrender, or surrender.

222
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:05,940
It's him!

223
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,711
-No!
-Wait!

224
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:08,735
Andy!

225
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:19,199
Welcome, blue-eye,
to the land of the Chambra.

226
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,211
No!

227
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:31,841
Run away!

228
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,946
Leave me alone!

229
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,219
Learn, blue-eye.

230
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,763
You are privileged
to be with the tents of my lord,

231
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:45,142
Sheik Ahmed Al Jaffar,
the lord of the sand.

232
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,353
I am Ibrahim Rasoul,
the warlord of the Chambra.

233
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,814
And you are my slave.

234
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:54,963
You should be proud to please me.

235
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:59,467
Take her to my tent and guard her.

236
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,618
-Is my lord, Jaffar, here?
-Yes, my lord, he is.

237
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:07,392
Then we hold a council of war.

238
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:23,764
Looks like the Hamancha are trying
to make the Chambra mad, eh?

239
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:28,018
Let's not give the Chambra a chance
to find out what we are up to.

240
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,144
Anyone see you?

241
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,730
No, but I saw the American car
over the rise,

242
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:33,690
and some Arabs were grabbing it off,

243
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:37,819
and I think they had a girl with them.

244
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,863
Well, that's just wonderful.

245
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,492
With the American out,
and us with full two days ahead,

246
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,891
we are sure to win.

247
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:49,289
We haven't won yet, <i>mein lieber Herr.</i>

248
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:54,313
Half the Sahara is still in front of us.

249
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,689
Get away from me!

250
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,032
No!

251
00:33:57,997 --> 00:33:58,997
Uncle!

252
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:00,623
Enough!

253
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,459
Stop!

254
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,772
I promise you, my lord,

255
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,233
she will not trouble you again.
I will see to that.

256
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:11,987
Really? You tried once before
and she burned your tent.

257
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:15,657
This time if she resists me,
I will cut her throat.

258
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,992
And so, Uncle, for a moment of pleasure,

259
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,662
you would provoke the Legionnaires
to invade our sand.

260
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,789
No. The French will not dare to interfere.

261
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,959
I pray you are right.

262
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,086
Take her to the camp
and put her in my tent.

263
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,735
No! This one is mine.

264
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:35,302
You forget, Uncle, nothing in the sand
is yours unless I say it is.

265
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:36,510
She is nothing.

266
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,431
Here, take her to my women's tent
and guard her carefully.

267
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:43,455
This one's like the wild animal.

268
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:59,368
Come, my lord, let us ride against Beg,
this killer of gypsies.

269
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:02,829
We ride, my brothers. To the Hamancha!

270
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,103
Follow me!

271
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:33,151
Von Glessing, my evil friend,
you have deceived me.

272
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,905
I asked for a war car! What do I get?

273
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:41,554
Precisely what you ordered, Lord Beg.

274
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:09,040
Now I will be the thunder in the storm.

275
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:17,004
It is my pleasure
to serve a valiant soldier, sir.

276
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:25,431
Soon I will want more cars, 10, 20, 100.

277
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:33,128
If we can just settle the payment, sir,
then I'll be on my way.

278
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,255
Go now, my devils!

279
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:40,654
Kill the goat, oil the women, we celebrate!

280
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:46,786
No, my indecent friend, I cannot.

281
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,980
Prayers must be said,
the women pleasured,

282
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,879
before silver can change hands.

283
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:01,448
Come, let me drive you
to my stronghold in my new stallion.

284
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:02,597
Mustapha!

285
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:10,355
Down!

286
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,850
Fall back!

287
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:52,355
Go back!

288
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,463
Good morning, child.
Have you recovered from your ordeal?

289
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:40,839
Who are you?

290
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:46,011
I am the Sheik Ahmed Al Jaffar's
personal valet.

291
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,160
Let me untie you.

292
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,727
You're English.

293
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:56,146
Quite. One of those mad Englishmen

294
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,858
who cannot stay out of the noonday sun.

295
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,402
May I be of assistance?

296
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,780
You can get me out of here.

297
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:10,452
Child, in the desert,
one does not ask the rock for water.

298
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:16,750
I am a slave here,
willingly, I admit, but quite helpless.

299
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:18,274
Please, eat.

300
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:25,592
There are no poisons, no aphrodisiacs.

301
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:28,762
The food is a gift
from my lord and master, Al Jaffar.

302
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:30,430
This Jaffar's civilized?

303
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:33,433
Well, I hope that one day

304
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:37,896
Jaffar will attend
my old university, Cambridge.

305
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,732
That, by the way, is my name.

306
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:43,276
I was a professor there for many years.

307
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,405
But as to your question, it has no answer.

308
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:47,948
But I have a race to win.

309
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:51,785
Child, your friends have told me
about this silly motor car race,

310
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:54,955
but for you, it simply no longer exists.

311
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:57,457
War now rules the sand.

312
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,606
The Lord Rasoul owns you.

313
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,462
That's what he thinks.

314
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,111
You are his property.

315
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,342
And when he returns and comes to you,

316
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:11,096
it would be wise if you allowed yourself

317
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,870
to enjoy his advances.

318
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,185
-You mean to let him...
-I was thinking rather more than that, child.

319
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,313
If you were to be impatient for his touch,

320
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:24,318
in fact, demanding,
he might postpone your disposal.

321
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:27,154
-You can't be serious.
-But I am.

322
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:31,533
Passionate surrender
is a small price to pay

323
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:36,330
for keeping that lovely head of yours
on its shoulders.

324
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:38,832
You have shamed the name of your father.

325
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:40,959
The Chambra do not retreat.

326
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,336
Would you rather they died?

327
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,006
It is better to be eaten by lions
than to be tormented by hyenas.

328
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,842
The tribes of the sands will mock us now.

329
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,344
The torment will pass, Uncle.

330
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,993
Words! Words!

331
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,264
If you are the mallet, strike!

332
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:59,913
Hit me, shoot me,
but give me no more words.

333
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,234
To drive, you turn like this,

334
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:10,008
you stop the car, you go back.

335
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:13,721
You turn first. That's it.

336
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,455
I think, General,

337
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:25,354
you should practice your driving
for a few days first.

338
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:47,877
I regret this unfortunate delay,
my desert lion.

339
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:51,905
But I'm sure
as soon as you have the vehicle upright,

340
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:56,284
you will most assuredly rule the sand.

341
00:41:56,308 --> 00:42:00,683
As for myself, I must be on my way.

342
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:05,689
Look, this race, I must win it

343
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:11,133
in order to bring you more cars, cannons,

344
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:14,032
maybe even an airplane.

345
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,412
This, your car.

346
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,581
That, mine.

347
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:25,877
Now that is... Agreed.

348
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,695
You may borrow my car
while I repair yours.

349
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,572
The armor fits both cars.

350
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:36,325
And I want him to drive me.

351
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:38,327
-Oh, no.
-Or you'll die!

352
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,579
Or my name is not Lord Beg.

353
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,228
Of course. Of course.

354
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,321
Come on, come on. Mustapha!

355
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,035
You can pay me later.

356
00:44:12,695 --> 00:44:16,945
What're you doing with my friends?

357
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:22,097
If you don't let them loose, they'll die.

358
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:27,121
Only Allah determines the hour of dying.

359
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:40,344
My lord. How may I serve?

360
00:44:41,432 --> 00:44:43,557
I claim the girl.

361
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,477
She is mine by law.

362
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,022
I am the law.

363
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,800
You shamed me once this day.

364
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,968
You will not do it again.

365
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,595
-It is done.
-No.

366
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,098
Only blood will see it done.

367
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:08,622
So, she makes the blood hot.

368
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:12,314
At last we have found a sweet
to your taste.

369
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:14,338
Good, very good.

370
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:17,319
You will not touch her.

371
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:19,738
Tonight is mine. I have the right.

372
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:23,450
The law says that she is mine.

373
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:26,453
Not if I take her as a wife.

374
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:28,727
You will not dare.

375
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,336
She is an infidel, a blue-eyed demon.

376
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,610
No, my lord, you must not.

377
00:45:37,947 --> 00:45:40,467
Then take her now, as my gift.

378
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:43,116
But do not marry her.

379
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,199
-Angelo.
-Yeah?

380
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:44,429
Faster!

381
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:51,478
Faster!

382
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:55,815
Faster!

383
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:45,509
Tell them that we make war.

384
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:48,470
That we are unable to extend
our customary hospitality to them.

385
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,596
Make them go away.

386
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,599
They claim they have come to see Ayesha,
the blue-eyed demon.

387
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,060
Nonsense!
Tell them to go to the other tribes.

388
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:56,084
My lord.

389
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:57,794
Uncle!

390
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,442
The gypsies are the houses of the legends.

391
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:05,112
The Chambra's shade is their shade.

392
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:09,449
My lord, the blue-eye has already started
the fire of fear amongst our people.

393
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,451
The gypsies will make it flame.

394
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:16,475
It is the law, Uncle, and our tradition.

395
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:22,190
Give them fire, tent and water.

396
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:31,680
Has she been told of her marriage?

397
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:34,683
Or does she frighten you, also?

398
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,832
She will be told.

399
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:50,718
You're a handsome beauty, aren't you?

400
00:48:52,725 --> 00:48:54,161
Have no fear.

401
00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:57,164
Who resides in my shade
has my protection.

402
00:48:57,188 --> 00:49:00,834
Protection? And what about my friends?

403
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:01,918
They also.

404
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,546
Then why don't you release them?

405
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,195
I will, in good time.

406
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:15,742
What does it mean
to be claimed by you, anyway?

407
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:31,969
Would you like to ride him?

408
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:40,767
It's like a dream.

409
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,979
This is the Chambra Oasis,
our secret place.

410
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:52,003
In my tribe, the young ones come here
to bathe before their weddings.

411
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:09,296
A waterfall in the middle of the desert!

412
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,570
It's breathtaking.

413
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,510
You are breathtaking.

414
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,409
Would they mind if I...

415
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:45,832
I want to thank you
for showing up like that yesterday.

416
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,001
You saved my life.

417
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,797
You must understand,
it was my uncle's right.

418
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:55,509
In the Sahara, a woman
with no blood relation to protect her,

419
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:58,970
belongs to the warrior who captures her.

420
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,869
So now I belong to you.

421
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:16,384
The water's so cool.

422
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:20,617
The car, why is it you drive it?

423
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:24,371
It was designed and built by my father.

424
00:52:24,395 --> 00:52:29,084
His dream was
to win the race across the Sahara.

425
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:33,005
Your father now resides with the stars?

426
00:52:33,029 --> 00:52:37,279
My father, also. Three years, now.

427
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:44,034
He was magnificent.
The storm of the Sahara.

428
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:48,395
"Resides with the stars." Beautiful words.

429
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:49,919
Like poetry.

430
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:53,754
It is the way of the desert.

431
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,217
Do you know that you are spoken of
around the campfires?

432
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:20,241
Really?

433
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:24,681
They say you are an evil power,

434
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,892
capable of possessing a man's soul.

435
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:29,416
And what do you say?

436
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:33,837
You are not evil.

437
00:54:08,124 --> 00:54:11,374
Our destinies are now one.

438
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:16,733
I wish we could stay here forever.

439
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:19,069
But we risked our lives
taking this shortcut

440
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:23,115
and now we're losing all that we've gained.

441
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:29,139
You must understand
what this race means to me.

442
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,188
You do understand?

443
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:37,819
Go back.

444
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,534
Come up here.

445
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:50,539
One, two. One, two.

446
00:54:58,507 --> 00:54:59,757
Roll over!

447
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,552
Boy.

448
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:13,165
Well now, you are the most fortunate girl.

449
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:15,459
You can say that again.

450
00:55:15,483 --> 00:55:18,795
But child,
that is hardly the costume I would wear

451
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:22,132
if I was of the mind
to surrender charms such as yours.

452
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:23,406
Surrender?

453
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:26,094
You don't know, do you?

454
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:27,368
Know what?

455
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:30,182
Someone should have told you.

456
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:32,392
You are to be his bride.

457
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:37,230
It's an absolutely
extraordinarily fortunate turn of events.

458
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:39,941
The taking of a first
wife is most auspicious

459
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:41,943
so, please, hurry and change.

460
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:45,113
Everything must be perfect
when you go to him.

461
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,408
Don't tease me, Cambridge, please.

462
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:53,057
I'm sorry, child, I am quite serious.

463
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:57,417
But he can't, he wouldn't.

464
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,878
He understood, he said he did.

465
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:02,172
And he meant it. I know it.

466
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:08,071
Did he actually tell you
that you could leave?

467
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,263
No, but he let me believe it.

468
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,600
Child, he can never let you go.

469
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:16,979
It will shame him in his people's eyes.

470
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:19,690
Then he lied deliberately.

471
00:56:19,714 --> 00:56:21,316
He was playing with me.

472
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,110
Well, I can play, too.

473
00:56:23,134 --> 00:56:25,009
You tell him...

474
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:29,428
No. I'll tell him myself.

475
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:46,008
Do not approach me.

476
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:47,592
Unless you come willingly,

477
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:50,012
and only with a gift of heart.

478
00:56:50,036 --> 00:56:53,306
You and your pretty words,
telling me you understood.

479
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,350
Well, you didn't understand anything.

480
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,374
Nothing!

481
00:56:56,834 --> 00:57:00,209
I have to finish this race.

482
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:23,712
She is a demon,
a demon from the house of devils.

483
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:25,672
You must see that now.

484
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:27,696
Patience, Uncle.

485
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,676
No! She has bewitched you!

486
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,346
Trust me. I will make her come to me.

487
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,973
Oh, no, my lord, she will not come.

488
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:37,392
She is stronger than you.

489
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,791
She must be forced.

490
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,850
I'll kill you, Rasoul!

491
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:03,775
Rasoul!

492
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,193
Rasoul!

493
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:08,423
Get over here in front of me
so I can see your face,

494
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,092
so I can spit in it.

495
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,241
Sand ape!

496
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:22,790
No! Just get them... Get them out of here!

497
00:58:23,129 --> 00:58:24,129
No! No.

498
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:27,234
Already they are beginning to scream,

499
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:30,737
and they will not cease
until you have willingly submitted yourself

500
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:38,386
to my lord, and gone
and crawled to him to remove his shame.

501
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:48,903
The Hamancha!

502
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:55,429
Cambridge, take the children
to the west dune,

503
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:57,806
and all the women to the oasis.

504
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,142
Rasoul, spread the men!

505
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:03,041
Barricades! Barricades!

506
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:09,004
To the oasis! Quick! Quick! Quick!

507
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,110
Hurry up!

508
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:16,947
Hurry up! Now take your positions.

509
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:39,741
Jaffar, my lord, no.

510
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,640
Abdullah, go cover him.

511
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,803
The rumors are true.

512
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:51,225
They have a demon woman
to protect them.

513
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:59,502
They believe you have possessed me.

514
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:05,010
And they are right.

515
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:16,854
You cannot win against me.

516
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:22,422
As I rule the sand,

517
01:04:22,446 --> 01:04:23,821
I rule you.

518
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:25,573
No.

519
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:30,055
Tonight, when the campfires are bright,

520
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,579
you will come to me.

521
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,500
Please, come to me.

522
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:54,436
Come on.

523
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:01,901
It is working.

524
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,069
Load up!

525
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:13,325
<i>Britannia! Britannia, rules the waves...</i>

526
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,044
Bloody hell!

527
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,179
-Damn fool.
-Sorry.

528
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:19,998
Here, you're gonna need this.

529
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:23,022
This is most unexpected.

530
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:29,401
I did not believe she would ever surrender.

531
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,326
But from the moment I looked upon you,

532
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,600
I have believed in the impossible.

533
01:12:50,913 --> 01:12:52,413
Go on, push!

534
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:02,465
Push!

535
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,142
What? What?

536
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:34,057
Please let me go.

537
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:36,476
I'll do better than that, child.

538
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,625
I'll go with you.

539
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:50,073
We can't have you getting lost, now,
can we?

540
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:52,075
Head straight for the hills.

541
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:58,474
It's a shortcut
through the mountain to your race.

542
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:17,117
Ayesha! Ayesha!

543
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,079
Ayesha!

544
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:22,289
-Ayesha!
-No! No!

545
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,417
No! No!

546
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,230
-Ayesha!
-Please! No!

547
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,254
Ayesha!

548
01:16:29,757 --> 01:16:30,757
Ayesha!

549
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:33,800
Ayesha! Ayesha! Ayesha!

550
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,074
-Ayesha!
-No!

551
01:16:37,098 --> 01:16:39,076
Get back! Get back!

552
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,100
Ayesha!

553
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:42,477
No!

554
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,731
No!

555
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,650
No! Please! No.

556
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:54,447
Please, stop!

557
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:00,704
No!

558
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:03,081
No!

559
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:40,971
We ride, Uncle.

560
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:42,723
Now is the moment you have waited for.

561
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:45,142
No, this is madness.

562
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,601
Before, you ran like a yellow dog,

563
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,228
today you roar like a maimed lion.

564
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:53,252
And for what? A blue-eye! A stupid girl!

565
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:03,577
Strike again, my lord.
You will not change Rasoul's mind.

566
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:06,747
They will take her to their caves,
and you cannot defeat them there.

567
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:08,957
You'll only spill good blood.

568
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:13,231
Pray, Uncle, that I do not return.

569
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:27,582
We ride!

570
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:55,796
So, at the moment, she transforms him.

571
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,423
Turns him into everything
you ever wanted him to be

572
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:00,300
you deny him your strength.

573
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:03,345
She has bewitched him. Made him a fool.

574
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:08,244
With your help, he would have a chance.

575
01:20:38,673 --> 01:20:41,048
The blue-eyed demon

576
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:46,239
who blew my beautiful car to pieces.

577
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:47,263
Welcome.

578
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:57,605
Welcome, little demon.

579
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:02,027
Now we will see

580
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:08,698
if you are truly the devil's daughter.

581
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:26,530
Get away from me, you dirty pig!

582
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:29,700
A wildcat! And a young one.

583
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:32,119
Do you know, I collect wildcats.

584
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:33,829
Collect! You pig!

585
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:37,541
Fight me, fight me, fight me.
I love it when you fight me.

586
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:39,940
It heats the blood!

587
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:50,345
Throw her into the pit!

588
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:55,434
If she is truly a demon
she'll still be alive when I return.

589
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:56,458
Stop!

590
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:33,577
Eat them my devils!

591
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:47,342
Eat them!

592
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:03,358
Kill them!

593
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:31,905
Hurry up!
Come on, get in position. Over the hill.

594
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,554
In position, quickly!

595
01:23:35,433 --> 01:23:38,933
Get in position. Take cover!

596
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,436
Rasoul, follow me!

597
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:28,568
Help!

598
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:40,871
Somebody help me!

599
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:42,374
No.

600
01:24:55,888 --> 01:24:57,013
The rope!

601
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,810
You want me with you?

602
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:06,522
Company fire!

603
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:16,259
Jaffar!

604
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:22,765
Grab the rope!

605
01:26:25,144 --> 01:26:26,269
Hurry up!

606
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:27,937
That's it!

607
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:31,232
Come on!

608
01:26:32,318 --> 01:26:33,318
Come on!

609
01:26:39,784 --> 01:26:42,721
-I can't!
-Yes, you can!

610
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:45,370
That's good. Come on.

611
01:26:49,669 --> 01:26:51,919
-No!
-Come on up!

612
01:26:56,467 --> 01:27:00,717
-I'm slipping!
-You must hold on!

613
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:03,973
No!

614
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:07,558
I can't! I'm slipping. No!

615
01:27:22,827 --> 01:27:23,827
Quick!

616
01:27:25,788 --> 01:27:26,788
No!

617
01:28:55,753 --> 01:28:57,003
Watch out!

618
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:58,129
Get out!

619
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:00,799
Get out!

620
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:14,813
Slowly.

621
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:37,792
Wait, little friend, wait!

622
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,025
The blue-eye!

623
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:04,735
Kill Jaffar and the blue-eye!

624
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:07,365
Kill them!

625
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:14,789
Kill them!

626
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:37,267
-Come on!
-Look out, my lord!

627
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:39,230
Take cover!

628
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:45,278
Rasoul.

629
01:30:56,123 --> 01:30:57,123
Uncle!

630
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:21,272
Rasoul.

631
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,900
-I die, my lord.
-No!

632
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:32,405
All my life, I have taken orders.

633
01:31:33,244 --> 01:31:37,119
From your father, and from you.

634
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:40,790
Now I would give one.

635
01:31:40,835 --> 01:31:44,585
To you, my son. Will you obey?

636
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:48,672
Give it, Uncle. I will obey.

637
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:55,681
Do not follow her.

638
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,145
Stay with the sand.

639
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:05,566
The desert.

640
01:32:07,945 --> 01:32:10,695
It is yours to take...

641
01:32:14,326 --> 01:32:15,826
And to keep.

642
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:52,364
Go!

643
01:33:08,172 --> 01:33:10,547
Hey! Let's get her.

644
01:33:11,342 --> 01:33:12,342
Go!

645
01:33:21,894 --> 01:33:22,894
Yeah!

646
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:26,940
Get in!

647
01:33:27,942 --> 01:33:30,253
-Let's go.
-Go on, you'll make better time without us.

648
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:32,381
-We'll see you at the finish line, bon-bon.
-Go!

649
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:35,509
-First place. Go on!
-Go! Go!

650
01:33:35,533 --> 01:33:36,783
All right!

651
01:33:47,753 --> 01:33:51,878
I swear I will avenge your death.

652
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,845
We take the rock!

653
01:34:24,582 --> 01:34:27,561
I knew she couldn't be trusted.

654
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:30,460
Takes after her father.

655
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:33,734
-You'd better jump.
-What?

656
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:37,404
I said you'd better jump,
you're dead weight.

657
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:38,428
Now!

658
01:35:11,087 --> 01:35:12,712
The junction!

659
01:36:38,883 --> 01:36:40,133
Hey, stop!

660
01:36:46,223 --> 01:36:47,473
Hey, stop!

661
01:37:31,102 --> 01:37:32,227
Blast it!

662
01:37:33,938 --> 01:37:35,813
Von Glessing...

663
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:26,066
Judges! Judges!

664
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:37,077
This is my wheel.

665
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:40,392
And my wheel crossed the finish line first!

666
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,666
Which means I won.

667
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:47,922
I...

668
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:36,323
You done it, babe, you done it!

669
01:41:36,347 --> 01:41:38,533
We saw you, kid. You were incredible!

670
01:41:38,557 --> 01:41:41,078
We did it! We actually did it!

671
01:41:41,102 --> 01:41:43,455
Everything's gonna be all right now,
bon-bon.

672
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:47,229
The car, the company, and you.
