1
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:56,436
Phil, when did you take this one?

2
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:59,003
A couple of weeks ago.

3
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,833 
Phil, that's impossible.
This man can't still be alive.

4
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,379
He's covered in tumors from head to foot.

5
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,710
May I take a sample?

6
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,651
This ground is sacred.

7
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,625
- We're both doctors, you know.
- Sacred ground!

8
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,496
No person but the Zambuli
has ever seen it before.

9
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,140
My God, it's true.

10
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,845
The healing earth exists!

11
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,503
The source has got to be
inside Gudjara Mountain.

12
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:53,873
Let's have a shot at it.

13
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:56,971
I have the wobblies.
Remember what Chief Haromba said?

14
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:01,243
Yes, caves are strange.
They can have weird echo effects.

15
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,483
But you know as well as I do, Betts,
echoes don't kill people.

16
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:15,262
Mommy!

17
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,285
Mom!

18
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:20,384
We'll take a sample here.

19
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:45,841
Mommy!

20
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:47,777
Janet?

21
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:51,009
The prophecy has come to pass.

22
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,542
On a day
when the sacred mountain cries out...

23
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:59,821
...a golden God-child
shall come from the depths of Gudjara.

24
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:05,153
And she shall grow in wisdom
and be the protector of the Zambulis...

25
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,822
...and all their creatures.

26
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:13,829
And she shall be called
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

27
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:50,473
Sleep now, little daughter.

28
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,373
This long day is over.

29
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,212
Much to learn, more to forget.

30
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,710
This is Shaba, the water horse.

31
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,513
It came to me!

32
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:50,593
Small person summons small creature.
You will grow, my daughter.

33
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:54,686
Are you all right?

34
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,038
A thousand, thousand moons ago...

35
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:46,805
...before She-Who-ls-Unknown
taught us peace...

36
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,473
...the Zambulis were great archers.

37
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,708
You will recall this when your time comes.

38
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,779
When will that be, Shaman?

39
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,652
I cannot say, Sheena.

40
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,455
But there will be great trouble
over the land.

41
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:04,854
You will know it when it comes.

42
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,246
- Good morning, your Highness.
- Hi, baby!

43
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,690
- Tell Mr. Grizzard I'm on my way up.
- Right away.

44
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,087
- You've got it?
- Right here.

45
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,961
It's confirmation of the sample
from the geo-satellite.

46
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,390
It's titanium all right!

47
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,426
Look at that, see that?

48
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,125
The Gudjara Mountain.

49
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:30,332
It's practically made of it!

50
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,566
There are billions in there for you...
And me, Prince. Right?

51
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,441
Burn it!

52
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:45,747
You mean it's on for tonight?

53
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:47,945
Yes!

54
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:52,383
Historically speaking,
killing a king has often brought bad luck.

55
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,928
Especially when he's your brother.

56
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:56,554
It's the only way.

57
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,499
He has this thing about the Zambulis.

58
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,228
Nobody steps on their turf.

59
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:06,301
- As long as he's king...
- Yeah, I know. No mining on Zambuli land.

60
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:13,104
Here's your prescription, Grizzy.
Take them after a meal.

61
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:19,582
I've added a cute touch, by the way.
You know those TV guys who are coming?

62
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:21,212
My pal, Vic Casey.

63
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,848
<i>- What about him?
- Story on me for Sportsworld.</i>

64
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:27,483
They'll be there tonight.
They'll catch my act on film.

65
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,824
- Sounds pretty risky.
- Not a bit!

66
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:34,798
My grief will break your heart.

67
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:38,234
- I don't like it!
- Trust me, man.

68
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:42,264
I'm the guy who kicked a 68-yard field goal
against the Denvers!

69
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:43,837
Who can stop me?

70
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:21,175
Shaman, we're not camping here?

71
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,618
You make camp.
This is the end of our Zambuli lands.

72
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:30,924
- From here, I walk alone.
- Please, don't go.

73
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,464
I must go. The city is a place of evil.
I've never visited one in my life.

74
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,591
But you know I must go there
to warn the king.

75
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:45,399
Are you sure he is in danger?

76
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,704
One is sure of nothing.

77
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:51,740
But I had the vision again last night.

78
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,710
I saw him lying in his own blood.

79
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:59,282
Our lands destroyed by a strange flame.

80
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:04,488
The heart torn
from our sacred mountain of Gudjara.

81
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:10,254
This cannot be.
Who would kill such a good king?

82
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:15,166
An enemy. One who takes without asking.

83
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:18,972
Embrace me now.

84
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:24,043
My heart goes with you, Shaman.
And my fear.

85
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:29,512
Keep the fear inside you.
I carry enough of my own.

86
00:20:56,911 --> 00:21:00,472
I lost count. How many have I had so far?
Six or seven?

87
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,743
You're going down the drain, Fletch.

88
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,944
You're right. Twenty pounds or else.

89
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:10,587
How's this for an opening shot?
We'll start in close on the tee.

90
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,059
You're kidding.

91
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:16,995
The King of Tigora is gonna bend down
and hold the football for a place kick?

92
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:21,057
When it's his brother Otwani kicking
for national television, he will.

93
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:24,195
Good luck.
I know you're pals with Otwani, but he...

94
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,142
Holy shit!

95
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,404
Look, right down there by the falls!

96
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,349
Where are we now? What are we by?

97
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:40,649
Tigora, sir.
Near the end of Zambuli territory.

98
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:43,222
Any white folk here?

99
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,656
No, very black!

100
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:49,958
King Jabalani keeps even us Tigorans
out of Zambuli land.

101
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,929
I'll bite, what did I miss?

102
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:57,698
You're not gonna believe this, Vic.
I just saw a blonde!

103
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,637
A blonde what?

104
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:02,870
A blonde. A girl!
She was swinging in the trees!

105
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,604
You mean a blonde gorilla?

106
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:08,210
I know the difference
between a gorilla and a girl!

107
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:11,275
You know, I'm worried.

108
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:15,012
Eight thousand miles from home,
my cameraman's mind has gone to mush...

109
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,216
...on some whacked-out water diet!

110
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,952
I know what I saw.

111
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,387
I know you did, and I believe you.

112
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:26,189
Page 4. Any problem with the setup?

113
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:54,824
Here's your prescription, Grizzy,
take them after a meal.

114
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,951
My man! What's happening!

115
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,621
My buddy!

116
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:05,892
Bad man of the Cougars!
How are you doing?

117
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,802
Astonishing. Is that the normal
greeting in your country?

118
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:14,068
It's called a "high five." Try it.
I'm Vic Casey.

119
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:19,239
Welcome to Tigora, Mr. Casey.
I'm King Jabalani.

120
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:22,472
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.

121
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:25,545
I found it tingling and delightful.

122
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:32,292
Our intended bride, Princess Zanda.

123
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:42,968
Cool!

124
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,497
Please follow us, Mr. Casey.

125
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:48,604
Fletch, get the bags, will you?

126
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:05,484
What's wrong? Are you lost?

127
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:10,320
I am not. Do I look lost?

128
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:13,033
You look like a Zambuli.

129
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:17,164
That is true. I am their shaman.

130
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,869
I have journeyed many days to Azan.

131
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,366
Where do I find the king?

132
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,841
So you want the king?

133
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,610
I've told you that already. Take me to him.

134
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:36,553
You're coming with us.

135
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:23,366
You would prefer the head of the table
for yourself, dear brother?

136
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,204
Not at all.

137
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:35,079
I have heard a strange rumor.

138
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:40,977
The cellar of the Grand Hotel
has armed guests.

139
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:42,612
Extremely strange.

140
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,590
You think someone's planning
a revolution?

141
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:51,159
I think it would be very wise
if you were to look into this.

142
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,172
Why are you here? You know it's not safe.

143
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:06,574
Mary, run to the Grand Hotel.

144
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:10,611
Tell Colonel Jorgenson I said
to keep his head down for a few hours.

145
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:11,514
Yes, Sir.

146
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,576
He's discovered something?

147
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:16,649
Nothing serious. Relax.

148
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:25,992
Did you hear the Zambuli shaman
has come to town?

149
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:30,631
Of course I've heard. I've had her arrested.

150
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,338
Are you crazy? Why?
What if Jabalani finds out?

151
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,641
He never will.

152
00:27:41,982 --> 00:27:43,643
A Zambuli Bow.

153
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,456
A dead king.
And a Zambuli shaman to hang for it!

154
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,762
What could be neater?

155
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:06,802
You're pretty good.

156
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:12,944
You're so wrong.
I am the most wicked woman in Tigora.

157
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,699
Marika!

158
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:58,987
I can't believe it!
Dinner at the palace, right?

159
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,856
I'm supposed to have cheese today.

160
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,191
I bet they have breadfruit and lasagna.

161
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,855
Be good for you.

162
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:10,064
Excellent preventative
against seeing imaginary blondes!

163
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:16,136
I'm telling you she was not imaginary!
I know a girl when I see one!

164
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:19,770
What was she doing in the jungle?
Her junior year abroad?

165
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,008
We missed our floor.

166
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,650
Tell me again. At the airport
you saw a helicopter gunship?

167
00:29:36,063 --> 00:29:41,899
No! Our story is about a guy
who kicks 60-yard field goals...

168
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:44,459
...and his brother is a king. That's it!

169
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,984
Center pic. Good, hold it there.

170
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:05,516
Higher up. Good.

171
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,761
Right, come on, Fletch, follow the pigs.

172
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,526
Watch the boobs
coming into the right of your frame.

173
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,398
Boobs? What kind of talk is that?

174
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,531
As in tits. Zanda, the king's sweetie.
We're for network, remember?

175
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:23,974
I see what you mean!
Boy, do I see what you mean!

176
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:34,550
Okay, follow the pigs.

177
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:44,224
- Jammed!
- Clear it, I need this shot!

178
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,288
A toast, dear friends.

179
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:50,894
A toast to our beloved brother,
Prince Otwani.

180
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:57,674
May his exploits with his royal foot...

181
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:04,206
...lead him to that curious American glory,
which I confess, puzzles me completely...

182
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,709
- Got it.
- Go.

183
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:11,356
..."Superbowl champions"!

184
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,200
Give me another magazine, quick!

185
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:32,100
Take this to the lab!
Start it through the soup, go on!

186
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,576
A Zambuli arrow!

187
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:53,924
It's a Zambuli woman.
We caught her with a bow.

188
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:02,742
No, Otwani! You are the king now.

189
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:07,379
You are quite right, Princess Zanda.

190
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,051
We'll leave her to the hangman.

191
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:16,622
Nairobi, Capetown...

192
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:19,187
Okay, that's got it.

193
00:32:19,826 --> 00:32:23,523
I don't give a damn,
just tell me where I can rent a Learjet!

194
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:26,958
Baby, you are talking to a man in pain.

195
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,729
I am sitting on an Emmy
and I can't get it out!

196
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:32,966
- You know what that means?
- Sounds like he needs a laxative!

197
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,600
Here's the piece
where the camera jammed.

198
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,269
No, 86 that, it was off the action.

199
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,243
Look at it first.
There might be a good frame or two.

200
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:42,941
Look at it first.

201
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:46,114
What is this?

202
00:32:48,188 --> 00:32:51,123
I don't know.
Let's look at it on the viewer.

203
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:54,259
Vic, take a look at this.

204
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:00,132
Right down in there.

205
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:06,464
Well, whatever it is, it's in a tree.
Look. There's the branch.

206
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,510
I'll run it ahead a bit.

207
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:15,043
Now, what's that line going across there?

208
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,010
Looks like a scratch.

209
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:21,146
That's no scratch,
it's an arrow coming out of that tree...

210
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,486
...going in just the right direction
to kill the king.

211
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:29,555
And that is a steel crossbow firing it.

212
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:32,497
And that's not a Zambuli bow, for sure!

213
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:36,461
Jesus, kid, if you're right,
you just got your union card!

214
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:39,528
"Top of the news," the man says.
"Dan Rather time."

215
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:44,275
We could get killed doing this!
I'm talking about bullets through the head!

216
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:46,369
Let's just turn around and go back.

217
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:50,746
All right, Fletch, you're absolutely right.
First plane in the morning, I promise.

218
00:33:50,984 --> 00:33:54,920
I want to interview that Zambuli woman
they've got locked in jail first.

219
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,985
Not only is he suicidal, he's crazy!

220
00:33:58,058 --> 00:34:01,459
They're not going to let us
just walk up in there, you know.

221
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:03,018
I have a pass.

222
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,430
A what? Let me see it!

223
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:31,951
What are you waiting for?

224
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:36,552
- The battery has gone dead!
- Too bad!

225
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,067
We'll start with an establishing shot,
then I want to zoom in on the gate.

226
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:19,837
Back when we played "doctor,"
that's what we called a girl. A blonde!

227
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:22,773
Fletch, I apologize! Roll, roll it!

228
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:45,446
- Vic, that's jungle up ahead.
- Sure looks like it.

229
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:47,986
I'm a city boy.
I get paranoid going to zoos!

230
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:49,713
Close your eyes.

231
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,710
We are ready to go.

232
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,017
Mission: Find and kill!

233
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:24,788
It's your neck if that shaman lives to talk.

234
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:29,794
And ditto for Mr. Casey
if he's made contact and got her story.

235
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,261
Consider them dead.

236
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,894
And the girl.

237
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:38,062
I want to see her alive.
She sounds interesting.

238
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,197
Not to me! You will kill her on sight,
Colonel Jorgenson!

239
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:45,937
Cool it! No women's lib stuff around here,
I give the orders!

240
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:48,810
With them finished,
it's on to Gudjara full speed.

241
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:27,980
What's wrong?

242
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:29,786
Hoof prints.

243
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:35,021
Running, I think.

244
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:41,226
<i>- How many toes has a zebra got, if any?
- He thinks he's the Last of the Mohicans!</i>

245
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:45,829
I could sue you for kidnapping
and you're bugging me about zebra toes?

246
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:46,872
All right!

247
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:50,906
I admit we have as much chance
of finding her here as a McDonalds.

248
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:55,437
But Fletch, we both saw her.
And while there's hope...

249
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:20,128
Nice kitty, nice.

250
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:25,266
Heel.

251
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,808
Make that plural.

252
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:37,513
Your friends?

253
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,138
Do you want to die?

254
00:40:59,612 --> 00:41:00,408
No.

255
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:05,515
Then go back! Tell the rest of your evil,
killing tribe not to hunt us!

256
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:14,158
You will remain here
to be sure he obeys me.

257
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:15,822
Get out!

258
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:18,823
I don't think so.

259
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:45,121
They understand you?

260
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:47,022
Of course!

261
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:49,726
Who are you?

262
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:54,832
I am Sheena.

263
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:03,532
I'm Vic Casey.

264
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,504
I cold-cocked that guard
when he was about to shoot you.

265
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,445
Remember?

266
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,507
You will be safe inside the circle.
Do not cross it.

267
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:15,143
Kibor, you stay here!

268
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,441
Hey, where are you going?

269
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:35,164
Who is that girl?

270
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:40,402
You okay?

271
00:43:40,907 --> 00:43:42,067
Where are we?

272
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:43,870
Central Park. Why?

273
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:50,474
Thank God. I thought I was...

274
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,885
We really have to do something
about this park!

275
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:57,184
It's getting worse all the time.

276
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:12,096
Your hand, it's so cold.

277
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,337
The flame departs.

278
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:21,970
Don't leave me.

279
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:27,779
I must, daughter.
My time is done, as yours is beginning.

280
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:30,280
It was foretold.

281
00:44:31,257 --> 00:44:35,489
Sheena will protect the Zambulis
at a time of great trouble.

282
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:39,095
She'll guard the sacred mountain...

283
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:42,465
...from the men
who would tear out its riches.

284
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,868
How? What can one woman do
against a man so strong...

285
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,999
...so evil as Otwani?

286
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:05,085
You're not alone.
I see a friend at your side.

287
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:09,258
Who? How will I know who it is?

288
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:12,763
How does one ever know?

289
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,601
You'll look at his eyes. You'll see.

290
00:45:19,538 --> 00:45:21,130
You must go now.

291
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:24,398
Leave me in the home
Chango has made for me.

292
00:45:25,077 --> 00:45:27,705
Shaman. Mother.

293
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:33,649
How soft, my daughter,
how pleasing to me.

294
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:37,645
Your tears upon me,
to extinguish the last embers.

295
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:41,850
My Sheena, my queen.

296
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:33,178
This is amazing!
It even keeps the mosquitoes out!

297
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,192
Now tell me. Why did you follow us?

298
00:46:59,605 --> 00:47:03,507
We're storytellers, with pictures, too.

299
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:06,873
And, baby, have we got a story here!

300
00:47:07,313 --> 00:47:10,646
Take me to that Zambuli woman
you busted out of jail.

301
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,610
The shaman? You want to see her?

302
00:47:15,187 --> 00:47:18,054
Yes, you see I know she didn't kill the king.

303
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:23,194
Let me carry her own words home with me
and I can prove it to the whole world.

304
00:47:23,262 --> 00:47:25,196
You must think I'm a fool.

305
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:27,126
Words are like the wind.

306
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,326
They cannot be carried home.

307
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:31,396
They can.

308
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,099
<i>You must think I'm a fool.
Words are like the wind.</i>

309
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,137
<i>They cannot be carried home.</i>

310
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:40,606
It bugs me, too.

311
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:44,137
Listen, why don't you just take him
to your shammie... your shaman?

312
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:49,116
She's gone far ahead.

313
00:47:50,156 --> 00:47:52,522
You will have to take a long journey
with me.

314
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:54,550
I'd love to.

315
00:47:55,528 --> 00:47:58,986
He sneaks back to Azan
to ship out some film we left there.

316
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:02,494
- I go with you.
- I like it!

317
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:05,335
Anybody object?

318
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,117
There is danger!

319
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:51,709
Come on, let's go! Get in here!

320
00:48:55,287 --> 00:48:56,754
Get the film!

321
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,040
Shit!

322
00:49:55,915 --> 00:49:57,075
Climb.

323
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:05,419
Come on, Vic Casey.

324
00:51:10,055 --> 00:51:11,044
Colonel...

325
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:14,224
...somebody slipped.
Yeah, he fell right here.

326
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,385
Did they go on?

327
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,158
I'm not sure.

328
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:21,631
Find out.
That's what you're being paid for.

329
00:51:57,102 --> 00:52:01,471
- I asked you, did they go on?
- I already told you. I'm not sure.

330
00:52:03,075 --> 00:52:04,064
All right.

331
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:08,776
We hike back to the vehicles.

332
00:52:18,257 --> 00:52:20,589
We sure handled that okay.

333
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:11,700
Fletch, you shouldn't be in Azan.
They are looking for you!

334
00:53:11,777 --> 00:53:15,213
I know.
They were at the lab a half-hour ago.

335
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:18,881
- You're probably going to be next!
- What?

336
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:23,646
How many have I had now? Let's see...

337
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:28,022
...three, no, I had six, seven...
I am going insane!

338
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:29,754
What is happening?

339
00:53:38,871 --> 00:53:41,601
All right, Juka, you did it, you got it!

340
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:44,471
The village where I was born
is only a few miles away.

341
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:46,407
We'll be safe there.

342
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:48,877
- Where is Vic?
- Don't ask!

343
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:48,403
Why don't you come in and wash?
You're as dirty as a wart hog!

344
00:54:51,643 --> 00:54:53,440
No, I don't think so.

345
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:56,376
Water frightens you?

346
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,015
Well, no, not exactly.

347
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:07,325
Come in, Vic Casey, the water is cold!

348
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:11,192
It's so good for you!

349
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:14,659
Remove those strange skins you wear.

350
00:55:17,135 --> 00:55:19,160
From what animal do they come?

351
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:22,598
The wild silk moth.
It roams in Bloomingdale's.

352
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:30,176
- Fur! You have fur!
- I have what?

353
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:35,312
The Zambuli men do not have fur
on their bodies. This cannot be.

354
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:43,259
Would you go back in the water, please?

355
00:55:43,795 --> 00:55:44,853
Why?

356
00:56:02,915 --> 00:56:05,611
Red One to Hawk One, do you copy?

357
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:12,156
Hawk One copies Red One, over.

358
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:14,049
<i>How's it coming?</i>

359
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:17,250
Very good. Over.

360
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:20,231
What I want to hear is, "Very soon."

361
00:56:54,032 --> 00:56:56,159
We will be safe here for a while.

362
00:56:56,234 --> 00:56:58,759
They would never believe
you could run over such rocks.

363
00:56:58,837 --> 00:57:02,364
- Me?
- Of course. They know I can run anywhere.

364
00:57:12,484 --> 00:57:15,351
Difficult on their feet.
I think we catch them now.

365
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:20,613
Wadman.

366
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:24,025
- What's the matter?
- Nothing is the matter. Tracks.

367
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:30,224
Zebra, deep.

368
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,605
- Must be carrying a heavy load.
- Somebody riding it, you mean?

369
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:35,662
Yeah.

370
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,966
- Maybe two people.
- Good.

371
00:57:39,444 --> 00:57:40,706
Let's go!

372
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:56,325
Your hair smells fantastic!
What did you wash it with?

373
00:57:56,395 --> 00:57:59,330
Zam Zam berries!
What else would a woman use?

374
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:01,558
Are your feet better now?

375
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:04,091
I think it's just possible
I might walk again sometime.

376
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:07,601
Sometime very soon.

377
00:58:12,811 --> 00:58:17,145
Rest, Marika. Eat.
I will summon you again soon. Go ahead.

378
00:58:20,052 --> 00:58:21,519
Come on, Vic Casey.

379
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:33,025
The dry season.
They cannot find anything to eat.

380
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,823
That big one in front, he's looking at me.

381
00:58:37,636 --> 00:58:40,662
That's a cow, Vic Casey.
All the big ones are cows.

382
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:43,401
They wouldn't eat you
if you were the last thing on earth.

383
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:46,069
Sheena, where did you learn all this?

384
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:50,039
Shaman taught me.
She told me everything.

385
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:53,515
I'm sorry.

386
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:56,614
Sorry?

387
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:03,519
I sat up last night.
You talked in your sleep.

388
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:05,820
I know she's gone.

389
00:59:07,265 --> 00:59:10,166
Then why do you still travel with me?

390
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:14,137
You said it was to find the shaman,
to catch her words in your box.

391
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:16,504
I did want to. That was the truth.

392
00:59:17,642 --> 00:59:20,110
But since then, I've found other reasons.

393
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:22,006
Say what you mean.

394
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:24,946
It's called chemistry.

395
00:59:25,016 --> 00:59:29,009
Say what you mean. Stop using words
you know I do not understand.

396
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,699
Do you understand that?

397
00:59:43,802 --> 00:59:44,791
No.

398
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:50,865
Mouths were given us to eat with.
Why did you touch yours to mine?

399
01:00:20,272 --> 01:00:23,264
There's your 10,
and I'll raise you 10 more.

400
01:00:27,112 --> 01:00:30,047
Sorry, Gramps. Queens full.

401
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:33,584
You lose!
Mombassa straight beat full house.

402
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,084
This pile of junk?

403
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:41,114
All red color!
One jack, rest of cards all even number.

404
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,020
Mombassa straight!

405
01:00:50,101 --> 01:00:53,559
Otwani has cut the long lines.
No calls outside Tigora.

406
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:56,667
- And the airports?
- Closed. No airplanes.

407
01:00:57,075 --> 01:01:00,977
But the bastards are working awful hard
to fix the gun-chopper.

408
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:02,773
Jesus!

409
01:01:03,682 --> 01:01:04,671
Vic!

410
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:11,949
These Zambulis of yours,
do they have guns?

411
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,291
Never! Guns are bad. Arrows!

412
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:18,760
Against machine guns?
Against armored cars?

413
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:23,624
A thousand, thousand moons ago,
they were the greatest of all warriors.

414
01:01:23,702 --> 01:01:26,933
Before She-Who-ls-Unknown
brought peace to every creature.

415
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:28,131
It is told!

416
01:01:31,376 --> 01:01:33,071
You make me want to cry.

417
01:01:34,246 --> 01:01:35,508
For what?

418
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:37,906
Just everything.

419
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:46,315
These are good. We'll eat here.

420
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:48,750
We need strength.

421
01:02:05,677 --> 01:02:08,441
Tiki saw something. Wait here.

422
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:13,506
Sheena.

423
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:16,813
Look through these.

424
01:02:17,622 --> 01:02:19,283
Try them, they're magic.

425
01:02:23,728 --> 01:02:26,788
Bad magic!
They've made you into a pygmy!

426
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:29,327
Try the other end.

427
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:39,469
Vic Casey, you are a giant!

428
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:42,146
Occasionally.

429
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:54,975
We'll blow it up!

430
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:58,484
All right, get some plastics
and blow the damned thing up!

431
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:01,820
Chango has stopped them.

432
01:04:02,861 --> 01:04:04,658
The soldier wagons drink water.

433
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:07,994
- Gasoline. How far back?
- An hour's running.

434
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:11,694
- An hour's running for you or me?
- You.

435
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:15,266
That's way too close.
Come on, we have to get out of here.

436
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:18,971
All right, get behind the vehicles. Move!

437
01:04:34,092 --> 01:04:36,856
Fletch, you are drinking
from two glasses now?

438
01:04:37,729 --> 01:04:40,789
That's right,
because there's two of me to get smashed!

439
01:04:40,865 --> 01:04:42,560
- Two of you?
- Yeah.

440
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:47,293
Fletch Number 1: He says,
"Go on up to Central Park, find Vic!"

441
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:50,534
Fletch Number 2:
He says, "To hell with that fool.

442
01:04:50,608 --> 01:04:54,806
"Walk across the border,
get the film out and get myself an Emmy."

443
01:04:56,781 --> 01:04:57,770
Cheers.

444
01:05:00,785 --> 01:05:03,185
- How many have I had now?
- Fletch Number 1...

445
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:08,157
...if you want to go up into the park,
I know the greatest tracker in Tigora.

446
01:05:08,226 --> 01:05:11,024
I don't.
I'd rather jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.

447
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:16,727
Where is he?

448
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,717
This is murder!

449
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:48,857
These thorn trees are our friends.
They will let us rest for the night in safety.

450
01:06:49,928 --> 01:06:51,259
What do you mean?

451
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:54,087
The soldier wagons
must come through here.

452
01:06:54,165 --> 01:06:57,362
Their round rubber feet
will be wrecked to pieces.

453
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:08,139
This forest ends soon.

454
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:15,313
We will be at the Lake of Birds.
The Zambuli lands begin there.

455
01:07:27,365 --> 01:07:30,857
Across those hills is Z'Kuru,
the first Zambuli village.

456
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:34,462
My feet will be swifter
when they're back on the sacred land.

457
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:36,769
You must be kidding! Swifter?

458
01:07:37,642 --> 01:07:39,234
Such beauty!

459
01:07:40,378 --> 01:07:41,709
Beyond belief.

460
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:45,706
I have been here at sunset 100 times.

461
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:49,111
And it has never moved me
as it does tonight.

462
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:54,558
- Shall I tell you why?
- Please.

463
01:07:54,626 --> 01:07:57,322
I am not a foolish young girl, Vic Casey.

464
01:07:57,662 --> 01:08:01,996
The shaman taught me that brave tales
do not always have happy endings.

465
01:08:02,367 --> 01:08:04,335
I know what guns can do.

466
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:08,432
I know that you and I may not live
to see another sunset.

467
01:08:21,085 --> 01:08:23,781
- You are an enemy.
- I'm what?

468
01:08:25,123 --> 01:08:26,886
The shaman taught me.

469
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:29,792
An enemy is one
who takes without asking.

470
01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:34,297
I'll ask then. May I?

471
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:40,595
Yes.

472
01:09:30,088 --> 01:09:32,886
Hold it!

473
01:09:35,326 --> 01:09:36,987
Refuel!

474
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:42,556
What's going on here?

475
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:47,530
These men got dragged
through the thorn trees!

476
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:51,236
So bury them!

477
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:00,474
It was a tiring night.

478
01:10:02,787 --> 01:10:04,948
The morale of the men is not good.

479
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:10,552
- A little killing is going to cheer them up.
- I don't understand.

480
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:12,425
We're in Zambuli territory.

481
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,421
Z'Kuru, next village. We hit it!

482
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:19,264
Their direct line of flight to Gudjara is here.

483
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:22,769
Z'Kuru is off to the side.

484
01:10:22,874 --> 01:10:25,775
I don't care! We zap Z'Kuru!

485
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:30,011
Now, the message goes ahead
by the jungle telegraph.

486
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:35,047
Those Zambulis up in Gudjara
won't stop running till they hit Cairo!

487
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,080
It is good psychology.

488
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:42,692
It is good for the men.

489
01:10:43,694 --> 01:10:46,492
Looks like you're going to enjoy it,
too, Jorgie.

490
01:10:49,534 --> 01:10:50,796
Oh, yeah.

491
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:56,531
You will be made welcome in Z'Kuru.

492
01:10:56,607 --> 01:11:00,407
The headman's locust-bean cakes,
they'll be your locust-bean cakes.

493
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:04,410
His fermented buffalo milk
will be your fermented buffalo milk.

494
01:11:04,482 --> 01:11:07,508
- His week-old dried...
- Please, I'm eating!

495
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:12,045
I will speak to the men
of the time of arrows.

496
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:15,091
We will take our bows
and attack the soldier wagons!

497
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:19,653
- What was that?
- An earthquake, maybe.

498
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:22,694
The land roars at Otwani.

499
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:45,719
- No!
- Let me see!

500
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:36,929
We'll beat the bastards to Gudjara
somehow and sound a warning.

501
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:40,570
It's the only way to save their lives.

502
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:57,387
How can fire burn so hot?

503
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:01,492
How can even stone pots
be made into ashes?

504
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:08,864
Gas, probably. Gasoline.

505
01:13:12,143 --> 01:13:13,872
You spoke of that before.

506
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:17,076
The water the wagons drink.

507
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:34,392
You are wrong, Vic Casey.

508
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:38,761
Warning is not the only way
to save people's lives!

509
01:13:39,303 --> 01:13:40,793
What else can we do?

510
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:42,569
Stop Otwani!

511
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:45,097
Come!

512
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,284
Here's one with the sap dripping out.

513
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:12,458
Make flame.

514
01:14:18,642 --> 01:14:19,973
Good.

515
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:24,111
You shape this with your blade.
I'll make fire grass.

516
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:50,271
- It is a good arrow.
- Yes, but it's front-heavy.

517
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:55,602
Yes, by three fingers.

518
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:02,417
They're coming!

519
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:28,802
It's the third truck from the front.
The one with the iron drums.

520
01:15:29,547 --> 01:15:32,311
I see it. Get your flame ready.

521
01:15:47,531 --> 01:15:48,520
Light it!

522
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:26,101
My God, you've done it!

523
01:17:36,207 --> 01:17:38,402
Red One!

524
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:41,340
They're on the ridge! Go get them!

525
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:41,163
- It's circling away!
- For a better shot at us!

526
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:43,229
What do we do, Vic Casey?

527
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:46,674
The smart thing would be
to stand up and wave this.

528
01:18:47,077 --> 01:18:50,535
Your cloth. It's magic?
It destroys the firebird?

529
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:52,849
No, it says we give up.

530
01:18:57,288 --> 01:19:00,348
We can make it to those trees down there.
Come on, run!

531
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:27,515
Hawk One to Red One.
Red One, what's taking you so long?

532
01:19:28,419 --> 01:19:31,217
We're tracking them. They're in the trees.

533
01:20:04,588 --> 01:20:08,684
Marika, warn them! Get them to safety.

534
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:23,595
Go!

535
01:20:34,318 --> 01:20:35,307
Go!

536
01:21:13,323 --> 01:21:15,757
Wait a minute, I spot their transport!

537
01:22:54,024 --> 01:22:56,754
I swear to God, I'd do it all over again.

538
01:22:57,194 --> 01:22:58,786
That pleases me.

539
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:02,631
I'm sorry.
There's so much I'd like to show you.

540
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,431
What would you show me?

541
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:07,664
I'd show you the view
of the Trade Towers from my loft.

542
01:23:08,038 --> 01:23:12,134
When you're walking down Wall Street
at night eating a sack of peanuts.

543
01:23:13,277 --> 01:23:15,142
Hell, forget them!

544
01:23:15,646 --> 01:23:19,742
It is easy, because there is so much
you did show me.

545
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,628
- Thank you, Vic Casey.
- You're thanking me?

546
01:23:34,798 --> 01:23:38,029
The fire in my veins tells me I'm still alive.

547
01:23:38,902 --> 01:23:41,132
I have not failed my people yet!

548
01:23:49,012 --> 01:23:50,741
It's pretty amazing.

549
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:54,279
You've been on my turf all my life
and I've never met you.

550
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,911
How have the Zambuli ever hurt you?

551
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:01,318
Why do you chain me?

552
01:24:01,825 --> 01:24:05,625
I'm your king. I can do anything I want.

553
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:10,724
- Don't even think of it!
- I'll try not to.

554
01:24:11,935 --> 01:24:16,269
- What would you do with her?
- She's protector of those savages, no?

555
01:24:17,107 --> 01:24:18,734
That's her story.

556
01:24:19,276 --> 01:24:21,471
I would fly her over Gudjara.

557
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:25,307
I would drop her
in the great Zambuli Falls...

558
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,313
...with the whole tribe watching.

559
01:24:29,252 --> 01:24:31,550
I like your imagination, Zanda.

560
01:24:32,055 --> 01:24:33,283
You'll do it?

561
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:35,252
Sorry.

562
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,922
Take her away.

563
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:45,096
And bring us Mr. Casey.

564
01:24:56,046 --> 01:24:58,537
You're a hard man to find, Vic, old pal.

565
01:24:59,549 --> 01:25:03,144
You had it made, you asshole!
And then it got to you.

566
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:04,545
Got to me?

567
01:25:04,755 --> 01:25:08,919
The cheering, the crowds.
The goddamn agents. Guys like me!

568
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:12,317
You had so much. You wanted it all.

569
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:19,299
Save that for Sunday school, Vic, old pal.
You should've stuck to your game plan.

570
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:22,304
When they put the rope around your neck,
you'll wish I had.

571
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:24,340
Around my neck?

572
01:25:24,408 --> 01:25:26,933
Hey, man, it's fourth down and 99 to go.

573
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:29,774
You're behind with five seconds
left on the clock.

574
01:25:29,846 --> 01:25:32,508
The ball bounces funny
in the last two minutes.

575
01:25:32,582 --> 01:25:34,743
You should see some film I shot.

576
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:40,079
<i>- I'll watch Sportsworld very closely.
- It isn't going to be on Sportsworld.</i>

577
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:44,253
I think it'll get a better rating
at the Organization of African States.

578
01:25:44,327 --> 01:25:48,730
Now, which shot is that?
Me kicking it over the palace roof?

579
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:51,801
Opens on a roast pig.

580
01:25:51,968 --> 01:25:55,301
Segue into a tree, close shot, night.

581
01:25:56,106 --> 01:25:58,233
Arrow zings from a catapult.

582
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,755
- Where are you taking me?
- Home!

583
01:26:23,734 --> 01:26:17,568
We are leaving on a mission at once.
Sealed orders from King Otwani.

584
01:26:34,211 --> 01:26:36,975
Now, where is this piece of film?

585
01:26:41,885 --> 01:26:46,117
If you kill me, that film still goes out.
It's in Azan in safe hands.

586
01:26:47,924 --> 01:26:49,448
Do you want a deal?

587
01:27:00,537 --> 01:27:02,129
What do you propose?

588
01:27:02,205 --> 01:27:05,038
You sign a treaty to be filed
with the United Nations...

589
01:27:05,108 --> 01:27:07,599
...giving independence to the Zambulis.

590
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:09,741
It buys you the negative.

591
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:12,907
You could be bluffing.
I'd have to see it first.

592
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:14,615
That's fair.

593
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:17,851
Okay, have someone drive him to Azan.
Bring him back with the film.

594
01:27:20,457 --> 01:27:22,186
All right, Blau, take him.

595
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:28,893
No tricks, old pal.
Remember, I'm holding your jungle queen.

596
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:31,492
- That cuts both ways.
- Meaning?

597
01:27:31,568 --> 01:27:35,402
Meaning anything happens to her
while I'm gone, you bastard, you hang!

598
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:39,868
Lucky man.

599
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:42,842
I think he scored.

600
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:45,977
Any tips for me?

601
01:28:02,332 --> 01:28:03,822
Jorgenson!

602
01:28:04,334 --> 01:28:08,134
The film comes back.
Casey's ticket is one-way!

603
01:28:13,143 --> 01:28:14,542
What the hell...

604
01:28:18,448 --> 01:28:20,575
I see my death in your eyes.

605
01:28:21,117 --> 01:28:22,880
<i>Red One to Hawk One.</i>

606
01:28:26,456 --> 01:28:29,721
It was an accident.
Did I damage anything?

607
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:38,497
You really plan to throw me
into the Zambuli Falls.

608
01:28:39,169 --> 01:28:40,932
It won't hurt a bit.

609
01:28:41,638 --> 01:28:43,868
It'll be over before you know it.

610
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:49,935
My head aches.

611
01:28:50,814 --> 01:28:53,044
Your firebird makes such a noise.

612
01:30:01,718 --> 01:30:05,984
Fly over the village.
Bring them all out for the show.

613
01:31:05,515 --> 01:31:08,916
- They're following us. Back to the falls!
- Wilco.

614
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:49,250
Bank to the left so I can push her out!

615
01:32:36,106 --> 01:32:38,597
- Get us out of here!
- There's no way!

616
01:34:14,837 --> 01:34:18,796
See? Even in chains we can defeat them!

617
01:34:21,044 --> 01:34:23,239
Turn your minds back, my people.

618
01:34:23,947 --> 01:34:28,111
Remember yourselves
a thousand, thousand moons ago!

619
01:34:30,353 --> 01:34:32,184
Bring your bows!

620
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:06,279
Nice melody, huh?

621
01:35:13,363 --> 01:35:14,352
Get out!

622
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:17,655
Leave!

623
01:35:46,062 --> 01:35:47,620
Chief Haromba.

624
01:35:59,876 --> 01:36:02,140
This is the edge of the Great Forest.

625
01:36:02,312 --> 01:36:04,337
We shall wait for them here.

626
01:37:22,992 --> 01:37:25,859
Now, Tiki, pass the word. Come on!

627
01:37:33,403 --> 01:37:35,894
Column, halt! Stragglers!

628
01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:43,142
Let's go get those bastards!

629
01:37:46,048 --> 01:37:48,016
First, we secure Gudjara.

630
01:37:48,184 --> 01:37:49,947
Otwani!

631
01:37:50,019 --> 01:37:54,149
As long as I live,
Gudjara Mountain will not be yours!

632
01:37:58,094 --> 01:37:59,425
After her!

633
01:39:18,374 --> 01:39:20,433
- Straight ahead.
- She went off to the left!

634
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,705
- Straight ahead!
- I said, to the left!

635
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:47,092
- Chief Haromba.
- We are ready.

636
01:40:09,759 --> 01:40:11,556
Hold it!

637
01:40:17,133 --> 01:40:20,068
Let's get out of this damned forest!
Back up!

638
01:40:24,273 --> 01:40:25,467
Attack!

639
01:40:55,771 --> 01:40:58,706
Withdraw! Get them all!

640
01:43:19,682 --> 01:43:20,671
Marika!

641
01:43:55,151 --> 01:43:56,140
Z'Kuru!

642
01:44:05,194 --> 01:44:07,321
I was only following orders.

643
01:44:07,963 --> 01:44:09,328
For Z'Kuru!

644
01:46:53,862 --> 01:46:54,954
Vic Casey.

645
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,829
Don't think about it.

646
01:47:00,703 --> 01:47:02,432
How did you do?

647
01:47:03,238 --> 01:47:05,365
They're all gone, dead!

648
01:47:07,509 --> 01:47:08,840
Great!

649
01:47:11,847 --> 01:47:13,610
- Me, too.
- No!

650
01:47:14,883 --> 01:47:19,013
It's a funny thing about fatal burns...
They say there's no pain.

651
01:47:22,257 --> 01:47:24,350
You're head is as clear as a bell.

652
01:47:26,261 --> 01:47:27,888
I've had it, baby.

653
01:47:29,064 --> 01:47:31,692
And all I can think of to say is, "Shit!"

654
01:47:45,314 --> 01:47:49,774
Okay, I got the Mombassa straight,
now this Zambesi flush.

655
01:47:49,852 --> 01:47:53,549
That's three red cards,
one black deuce and...

656
01:47:54,456 --> 01:47:57,289
...a one-eyed jack, right?
- Jack got to be red.

657
01:47:57,993 --> 01:48:01,622
Otherwise got to have
three cards under nine, add up to...

658
01:48:07,002 --> 01:48:08,594
Vic!

659
01:48:09,905 --> 01:48:10,894
No!

660
01:48:11,707 --> 01:48:14,005
- They're killing Vic!
- No, they're not!

661
01:48:14,109 --> 01:48:16,270
- They're murdering him!
- No!

662
01:49:26,348 --> 01:49:27,010
Tell me more about the places
you will show me.

663
01:49:29,084 --> 01:49:31,575
Where the jackals eat? Twenty-one?

664
01:49:34,423 --> 01:49:36,254
I've changed my mind.

665
01:49:36,825 --> 01:49:39,123
You're not seeing any of those places.

666
01:49:43,065 --> 01:49:45,795
- You mean, you stay here?
- I can't.

667
01:49:46,568 --> 01:49:49,401
I've got to take this earth home
to be analyzed in a lab.

668
01:49:50,139 --> 01:49:53,700
Maybe even duplicate it.
It might even be a cure for cancer.

669
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:56,141
Vic Casey.

670
01:49:57,579 --> 01:49:59,638
I do not understand.

671
01:50:00,616 --> 01:50:03,176
They'd kill you
if they got their hands on you.

672
01:50:03,252 --> 01:50:05,720
- Who would kill me?
- All of us!

673
01:50:05,954 --> 01:50:07,012
You?

674
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,979
Hey, Vic!

675
01:50:11,994 --> 01:50:14,724
Boy, are you guys hard to find! 'Morning.

676
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:16,795
We'd adore you to death.

677
01:50:16,865 --> 01:50:20,995
With printed words, with moving pictures
that go through the air...

678
01:50:21,069 --> 01:50:23,401
...they'd put stiff hides on your feet.

679
01:50:23,472 --> 01:50:27,238
Listen, Sheena baby, just move
over a little bit so I can get you in the sun.

680
01:50:27,309 --> 01:50:29,743
- Perfect...
- Let me see that a second.

681
01:50:29,811 --> 01:50:34,510
It'll be really grainy when I blow it up...
What the hell are you doing?

682
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:36,676
We're talking an Emmy here! $1,000,000!

683
01:50:36,752 --> 01:50:38,447
Fletch, get out of here!

684
01:50:39,655 --> 01:50:41,282
A favor.

685
01:50:48,197 --> 01:50:49,926
Forget the $1,000,000, huh?

686
01:50:51,033 --> 01:50:53,627
I'll win it back from you
when we play poker!

687
01:51:03,178 --> 01:51:07,706
If the world finds out where the healing
earth comes from, this is all gone.

688
01:51:08,383 --> 01:51:11,682
You, the Zambulis,
everything you've got going here.

689
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,961
What are you telling me, Vic Casey?

690
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:32,466
How much I love you, Sheena.
So much it busts my heart!

691
01:52:00,902 --> 01:52:02,699
My heart breaks, also.

692
01:52:05,073 --> 01:52:07,541
Put out the "Don't Disturb" sign, will you?

693
01:52:08,243 --> 01:52:09,232
What?

694
01:52:10,178 --> 01:52:11,167
Him.

695
01:52:14,783 --> 01:52:17,547
Tell him we won't be disturbed
for a few hours.

696
01:53:00,429 --> 01:53:02,624
<i>Will you return, Vic Casey?</i>

697
01:53:03,999 --> 01:53:06,399
<i>Yes. Say it again.</i>

698
01:53:08,303 --> 01:53:09,770
<i>I love you.</i>

699
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:12,968
<i>Again.</i>

700
01:53:13,675 --> 01:53:16,166
<i>Must we waste this hour on words?</i>
