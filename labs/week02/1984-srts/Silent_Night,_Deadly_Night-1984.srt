been asking for, Mother Superior.

191
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,999
- Proof.
- Of what, Sister Margaret?

192
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,559
What I've been saying.

193
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,959
That it's all still inside him.

194
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,839
All that terrible violence he saw.

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,919
His drawing clearly shows that.

196

I am not interested
in what you think.

I thought you finally
understood that.

198
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,279
Simply because something unfortunate
happened to his parents,

199
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,159
which he knows nothing about,

200
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,079
is no reason to allow
him to run wild.

201
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,199
He must be taught.

202
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,479

Mother Superior,
waiting to come out.

204
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,039
And if it does, and if he has
received proper training,

205
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,919
he will know how to cope with it.

206
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,599
But if he keeps going on
like this much longer,

207

it may be too late.

him every Christmas.

What the fuck do you
think you're doing now?

352
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,679
I'm... you know, you
shouldn't talk like that.

353
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,919
Oh, well, excuse me, Ann Landers.

354
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,919
You know, what is it
with you lately, Billy?

355
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,399
Nothing.

356
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,679
I'm going to level with you.

357
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,359
When you came here a
couple of months ago,

358
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,919
you were an all right kid.

359
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,879
But all of a sudden, you got
this fucking attitude problem.

360
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,679
Snapping at me all the time.

361
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,039
You're staring off into
space like some moon goon.

362
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,359
Will you just... just leave
me alone, all right?

363
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,479
When I leave you alone, asshole,

364
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,559
none of your fucking
work gets done.

365
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,439
Look, I don't care
about my fucking work.

366
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,999
Oh, is that so, wise ass?

367
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,767
Look, just leave me alone.

368
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,039
Merry Christmas,
everyone. Ho, ho, ho.

369
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,408
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho.

370
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,724
Come here, you little bastard.

371
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,999
- Pamela.
- Are you all right, Billy?

372
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,159
Yeah.

373
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,799
Yeah, I...

374
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,359
You don't look so good.

375
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,319
No, I'm fine.

376
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,290
Really, I...

377
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,643
Don't worry about this stuff.
I'll straighten it up for you, okay?

378
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,519
- (SHUDDERING)
- Are you sure you're all right, Billy?

379
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,719
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,805
I never felt better in my life.

381
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,247
(PAMELA'S VOICE) Billy, are
you sure you're all right?

382
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,560
(BILLY'S VOICE)
Never felt better in my life.

(SCREAMS)

384
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,999
No! Don't!

385
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,482
No!

386
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,919
I want to be good.

387
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,999
I didn't mean to be naughty.

388
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,199
- (YOUNG BILLY'S VOICE) I'm sorry.
- Don't punish me.

389
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,439
Don't punish me.

390
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,604
(YOUNG BILLY'S VOICE) Please.

391
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,119
Christmas Eve.

392
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,799
Only one more day and this
Christmas crap is history.

393
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,239
I hate to ruin your
party mood, Mr. Sims,

394
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,239
but a teensy problem has
arisen personnelwise.

395
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,159
Well, do something
about it solutionwise.

396
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,039
It ain't that simple, Mr. Sims.

397
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,439
I just got a call from
one of the employees.

398
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,519
Seems he went ice-skating last
night and broke his ankle.

399
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,159
He'll be out for the
remainder of the season.

400
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,079
Lucky him.

401
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,839
Call the temporary agency
and get a replacement.

402
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,279
Do I have to think of
everything around here?

403
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,279
Well, then think of this.

404
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,159
The agency's only got women.

405
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,724
This job requires a person
of the male persuasion.

406
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,279
- Oh.
- A big, fat, jolly one.

407
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,199
- You're receiving me?
- Oh, no.

408
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,679
Ho, ho, ho. (LAUGHS)

409
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,479
You pull another disappearing
act like yesterday, Billy,

410
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,279
and I'm going to go
straight to Sims.

411
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,199
I don't think you realize this,
but I'm giving you a break.

412
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,639
That's a hell of a lot
more than he'll do.

413
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,439
Sims is nobody's friend.

414
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,079
Remember that.

415
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,079
- Ah, Mr. Sims.
- Billy boy.

416
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,999
How are you?

417
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,166
I've been meaning to come around and
see how you're enjoying yourself.

418
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,884
Well, everything okay?

419
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,399
Uh, yeah. Yes. Fine.
Everything's fine, Mr. Sims.

420
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,519
Good, good. Good boy.

421
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,919
Ah, listen, Bill.

422
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,199
The reason I dropped by,

423
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,519
I've got a little problem

424
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,439
maybe you could help me with.

425
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,839
I mean, if you'd like to.

426
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,279
Well, of course, Mr. Sims.

427
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,559
Anything you want. You just tell me
what it is and I'll be glad to help out.

428
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,930
Good. Good boy. Thank you.

429
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,879
That's very good.

430
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,079
Very realistic. Isn't
it, Mrs. Randall?

431
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,448
He's definitely fat and jolly.

432
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,126
Take a closer look at yourself
in the mirror, Billy.

433
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,839
Now just remember, be jolly.

434
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,239
Lots of ho, ho, ho.

435
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,239
Try not to scare the
little bastards.

436
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,359
Sometimes they cry their heads off.

437
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,239
I guess they think
the old guy's scary.

438
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,919
Silly, isn't it?

439
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,479
Yeah.

440
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,959

Stop it. Stop kicking.

449
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,599
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

450
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,359
You're being naughty.

451
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,679
Right on Santa's lap.

452
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,359
I don't bring toys
to naughty children.

453
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,599
I punish them.

454
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,207
Severely.

455
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,766
That's right. Stop it.

456
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,409
Or I'll have to punish you.

457
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,639
He sure knows how to handle kids.

458
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,405
He's great, isn't he?

459
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,848

No, no. Billy don't
work back here no more.

Sure, sure. I can
tell you his new job.

Ho, ho, ho.

He's playing Santa Claus for

01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,410
Get out... get away from him!

811
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,048
(GUNSHOTS)

812
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,879
Oh, my God. Children,
inside. Hurry.

813
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,599
- Santa!
- What happened?!

814
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,970
Ricky! Come away from there.

815
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,959
MAN ON RADIO:
A man dressed as Santa Claus

816
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,079
was shot and killed
at Saint Mary's Home.

817
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,399
Ambulance is on the way.

818
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,201
I'm sorry, Sister.

819
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,647
But at least it's all over.

820
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,599
Captain, we got a problem here.

821
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,879
The description of the
dead man, it's all wrong.

822
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,359
What do you mean all wrong?

823
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,519
Barnes says the guy's about
50, under six feet tall.

824
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,519
My God.

825
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,559
It's Father O'Brien.

826
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,839
He was our Santa this year.

827
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,119
Kid we're looking for is 18.

828
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,439
Barnes wanted the guy to stop,
Captain. He didn't respond.

829
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,679
But of course not, he's deaf.
He couldn't hear it.

830
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,959
You tell Barnes to
stay at the orphanage.

831
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,639
The killer may still
be on his way there.

832
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,439
10-4.

833
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,208
We've got to help him.
We've just got to.

834
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,159
I don't understand how you could
have mistaken Father O'Brien

835
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,002
for the murderer in the first place.
He was dressed as a Santa Claus.

836
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,319
Captain Richards can explain
everything when he gets here, ma'am.

837
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,327
I'm sorry for what happened, but
there is a killer on the way here.

838
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,439
Oh, the children.

839
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,919
No harm must come to the
children. Do you understand?

840
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,719
That's why I'm here, Sister.

841
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,039
I am Mother Superior.

842
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,841
And so far, all you
have done is harm.

843
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,039
I'm sorry.

844
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,199
I'm going to check out the grounds.

845
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,959
In the meantime, you make sure
everyone stays locked up inside.

846
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,079
Don't let anybody come in unless
you know exactly who it is.

847
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,609
No one is going to get in
that doesn't belong here.

848
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,091
Poor things are scared to death.

849
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,804
Hmm? Oh, yes.

850
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,279
They need something to
keep their mind off it.

851
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,250
Richard.

852
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,279
Yes, Mother Superior.

853
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,759
Will you please get my pitch pipe?

854
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,439
Thank you.

855
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,079
Such a good boy.

856
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,799
Not at all like his
older brother William.

857
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,359
Children, listen to me.

858
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,279
I know that you're very
upset and I understand,

859
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,919
but I want you to stop that moping.

860
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,399
We're going to sing. Thank you.
