1
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,838
<i>Once again the planet Earth is
on the brink of destruction.</i>

2
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:26,521
<i>So that's not unusual.</i>

3
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,542
<i>Life should die
on their planet.</i>

4
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:31,462
<i>They've almost completely
drained their resources.</i>

5
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:33,436
<i>We must send twin advisors.</i>

6
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,101
<i>- Why should we care?
- We must care, we must keep trying.</i>

7
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:40,565
<i>After we sent our twin
advisors to China,</i>

8
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,671
<i>the Chinese tried to
take over the world.</i>

9
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,178
<i>Now they're playing with
the control of gravity.</i>

10
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,124
<i>If they were to be successful,</i>

11
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,740
<i>it would be a catastrophe for
the entire galaxy.</i>

12
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,307
<i>We must help earth.</i>

13
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>Unfortunately I do
not agree with you.</i>

14
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:58,179
<i>Prepare twin advisors this
time we will implant them...</i>

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,210
<i>into an American mother
was about to give birth.</i>

16
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,301
<i>Perhaps you will
have better results.</i>

17
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:04,978
<i>Of course I'll do it.</i>

18
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>But I don't believe you can
do anything with her things.</i>

19
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,973
<i>Pick the American
couple carefully.</i>

20
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,438
<i>They must be intelligent powerful
and admired by their countrymen.</i>

21
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:17,143
<i>And recall our advices in China.</i>

22
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,957
<i>The Chinese will search
everywhere for them.</i>

23
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:23,217
<i>Good, that'll keep them
busy for many years.</i>

24
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:26,985
<i>...of course you know
they have never done...</i>

25
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>an honest day's
work in their life.</i>

26
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,852
<i>I said why you don't even know
where your ancestors stole it from.</i>

27
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:35,708
<i>And I said now.</i>

28
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,090
<i>Caleb do you know
that your grandfather...</i>

29
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:41,241
<i>made his fortune on
nerve gas and napalm.</i>

30
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:42,885
<i>perhaps you'd look
at me with that...</i>

31
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:44,824
<i>inevitable smile
he said history was...</i>

32
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:46,117
<i>never one of
my best subjects.</i>

33
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:50,589
<i>Ooh and he's so large.
I could pull him up.</i>

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,288
<i>you know I just cannot
stand the thought...</i>

35
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>The woman is beautiful
as her only the phone company.</i>

36
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:02,855
You're him!

37
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:06,143
- How's that?
- You're the beautiful people.

38
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:08,587
And you're out here with
me just like anybody else.

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,425
Well my wife and I never
believed in putting on the door.

40
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,057
You know what I mean.

41
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,286
Just because we got money
coming out of our ears,

42
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,367
Doesn't mean we have to act like we're
any better than anybody else.

43
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:23,035
Boy, you are democratic.

44
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,689
Shouldn't even mention it.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,731
You can imagine what kind
of a kid I'm gonna have.

46
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:33,809
- All babies are beautiful.
- Ever see a baby rhinoceros?

47
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,119
I don't know why they let
people as ugly as me reproduce.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,922
I should be circumcised.

49
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,412
- You mean castrated.
- Castrated right yeah.

50
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,726
I should be castrated.

51
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:49,067
When they bring my kid to that window,
I wouldn't look up.

52
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,773
I'm sure it'll be a beautiful
specimen mister...

53
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:57,279
- Schillfit.
- Sr. Schillfit.

54
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:05,015
Two bundles coming up.

55
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,070
Well we're the last ones,
must be you.

56
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,839
- Could be you.
- Twins?

57
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:14,129
That's a repulsive thought.

58
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,505
Oh Jesus, nevermind.

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,670
No, I'd do it. I knew this
was gonna happen.

60
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:27,503
I told her.
Oh God. Oh god, no!

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,191
<i>We deserve.</i>

62
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:43,294
Oh, Dr. Frankenstein is
Lutetia is okay?

63
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,405
Oh, she's fine.
She's sleeping now.

64
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:47,652
Did she deliver already?

65
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:51,634
Caleb, I don't know what happened it.
Was a billion to one chance.

66
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,414
But those are your children.

67
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,503
- Little baby monsters.
- Halleluiah!

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,122
Oh thanks, I've do not take.

69
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:09,142
God bless you.

70
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,431
Oh no!

71
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:38,044
No, they're not mine.

72
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,699
It's been a mistake,
those are Mr. Schillfit.

73
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,907
You done it.
Not me!

74
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,661
Caleb!

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,907
Mr. Swain what can you
tell us about the twins?

76
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,664
A couple of beautiful babies?

77
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,393
Mr. Swain how about some folks
our are viewers would just love...

78
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,815
an exclusive interview with a
wrench and beautiful father...

79
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:35,048
of beautiful twins.
Mrs. Swain, Mr. Swain!

80
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,933
Ugliest baby I've ever seen.

81
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,331
Shure they've give send back.

82
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,193
Oversize hands, oversize feets,
Oversize brains.

83
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:54,513
I got a call to head vet
in San Diego Zoo.

84
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:56,394
<i>I've never seen
anyone like this...</i>

85
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:07,700
- Honey, there you are.
- My sweet, come to mama.

86
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,084
Honey, the ugly babies,
they are not ours.

87
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,889
He had a beautiful baby!

88
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,668
But they have all
their fingers and toes?

89
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,108
Yes, they've all the
fingers and toes.

90
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,012
- They have two eyes?
- Two eyes.

91
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:50,540
No, I mean each one has two eyes
not two eyes between them.

92
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,912
No, my dear,
they're not cyclops.

93
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,916
But they might as well be cyclops,
that's what you're saying isn't it?

94
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Of course not.

95
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,359
This is Lum Fung People's
Republic of China's spy...

96
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,575
Number five thousand six
hundred and thirteen, calling.

97
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:24,122
Coming, People's Republic
headquarters, over.

98
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,806
Yes, Lum Fung.
Have you found the twins?

99
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:30,154
<i>Ugly. I have found the biggest
ugliest twins in history.</i>

100
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,946
<i>I have a news
update for you.</i>

101
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:35,483
<i>The People's Republic of China
has just announced they...</i>

102
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:38,862
<i>are severing relations with
every country on this planet.</i>

103
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,162
<i>And their ambassador
will be here to talk about.</i>

104
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:43,640
<i>And that'll be right
after this really important...</i>

105
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,336
<i>message from
one of our sponsors.</i>

106
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,160
We're 20 seconds into
the commercial 40 to go.

107
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:11,920
Ready music,
ready tonneau car.

108
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:12,921
ready tell us any.

109
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,304
Well give my regards to China.

110
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,392
- Her name?
- Ambassador Ah Fong.

111
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,575
Commercials on right now.
So why don't you set up.

112
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:36,142
<i>35 seconds the air. Merv,
the Chinese Ambassador is here.</i>

113
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,984
Merv, Merv!

114
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,325
Good.
Thank you, guys.

115
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,527
Fine now you leave
that right there, sir.

116
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,166
And the boys leave.
You can all go in and watch...

117
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,896
- the show in the control room, huh?
- I stay right here.

118
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:51,334
You can't. We have cameras
and booms and lights.

119
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,624
- you're gonna be in the way.
- I stay right here.

120
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,709
I guard or no dice.
we go back home.

121
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,167
No, no, no!
Lou, Lou.

122
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:03,293
The guys can shoot
around the zipperhead?

123
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,021
I care, ok.

124
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,231
He's on!

125
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>The ambassador to the United Nations
from the People's Republic of China...</i>

126
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:14,348
<i>Mr. Ah Fong announced
at noon today...</i>

127
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,871
<i>that his country is
severing all relations.</i>

128
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,622
Diplomatic, commercial and cultural
with all other nations on earth.

129
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,132
Without further we do.

130
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,427
I have the honor of
presenting Mr. A Fong.

131
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,529
Mr. A Fong, when
you say the China is...

132
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,315
severing relations for
the rest of the world.

133
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:50,643
Is that because China is mad at
something that somebody did.

134
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,148
Definitely not.

135
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,413
You see and the rest of the world
has nothing left to offer us.

136
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:00,370
You very backward.

137
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,084
They would not
appreciate some of the...

138
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:04,035
things that we would
be willing to share.

139
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:07,111
Have you solved all the
problems that we are.

140
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,605
Oh, no.
Not quietly.

141
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:14,397
We are still in the dark ages
on simple little things in life.

142
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,122
Little things, gravity.

143
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:20,898
Is there a chance that China
will ever allow a visitor in again.

144
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:26,687
Of course, as long as he or she
is willing to sleep in an icebox.

145
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:29,078
And live all further half
a pound of rice a year.

146
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,778
<i>Well, I guess that excludes me.</i>

147
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,779
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

148
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,094
<i>I wonder Mr. A Fong.</i>

149
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:37,177
<i>Could you leave us today with
some words of wisdom.</i>

150
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,330
<i>Oh well...</i>

151
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,665
I understand that you are
happy the way you are.

152
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,823
Enormous sweaty backward kind of
people but if you happy that way.

153
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,881
You have my blessings.
I would like to leave you...

154
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,511
you however with the
key through success...

155
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:57,970
of Chinese sciences.
The key might be found in one word.

156
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,669
Twins, twins.

157
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,128
Remember the words of Confucius.

158
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,604
He's the one they said:
Two heads are better than one.

159
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,163
I love your idiomatic
expressions.

160
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:13,900
In fact I have a very appropriate
expression for living you.

161
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,360
And that is to you the
people of the United States.

162
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,312
Up your ass
with Mobil gas!

163
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,714
I never say ass on
network television.

164
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,754
Oh shit!
I just did.

165
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:30,575
Hey Mon!

166
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,480
I do, you mustn't
blame yourself.

167
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:38,729
The whole natural order is going skew with
the mainland Chinese two inches higher.

168
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,042
And gasoline up to $28 a pint.

169
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:45,635
And that's your old family doctor.
I must do what is best for you and Caleb.

170
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,566
I want you to go home as
though nothing has happened.

171
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:52,568
The Twins will stay here where we
have the finest life-support systems.

172
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,101
Apart from the Chinese, of course.

173
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:58,269
And we'll keep them alive as long as we
possibly, can maybe weeks, maybe months.

174
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,618
But that should be
our ordeal not yours.

175
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,335
Neither you and Caleb owe it to the
world to go on being beautiful.

176
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,719
And rich, and cheerful.

177
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:14,277
Yes you're probably right.

178
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,252
Oh you're always right.
but I...

179
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,226
I want they won't
live the hospital.

180
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:25,287
I want them in a place in
case they notice something.

181
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,952
<i>I just wanted to feel...</i>

182
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,491
<i>that they're at the
center of things and...</i>

183
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,316
that they're at home.

184
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:34,543
I do you need say no
more it shall be done.

185
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,628
- You're the boss.
- Yes.

186
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,815
- I want job.
- In the cook?

187
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,736
Well, we do need a cook.

188
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:17,462
But I have to ask you.
Are you a communist?

189
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,316
No. I'm in this bullshit.

190
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,722
Lun Fun crazy about.
Free enterprise!

191
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,013
Your face looks
very familiar to me.

192
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,708
We all look alike.
All can same damn face.

193
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,126
Well you'd have to cook for a staff
of 30 people and two children.

194
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,403
- Do you like children?
- Bet your heats.

195
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,204
Welcome then, thank you.

196
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,778
- I am Sylvester.
- Sylvester.

197
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,468
The butler.

198
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,782
You remember?
You advertised in the mortician sweep.

199
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:03,683
Don't worry I said you can
put the children in my hands.

200
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:07,816
I will treat them
just I would my owns.

201
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,325
I would go in familiarize myself
with my private quarters.

202
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:18,771
Just, just a moment...

203
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:25,719
- My name is Quentin.
- Who.

204
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm a handyman.

205
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,638
<i>The financials news.</i>

206
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,170
<i>Gasoline has risen to all time high,
one thousand dollars a gallon.</i>

207
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,931
<i>Forcing even the
wealthiest to convert...</i>

208
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,864
<i>to the low performance energy
produced by chicken droppings.</i>

209
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,815
<i>For the fifteenth year in a
row the big three of Detroit...</i>

210
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,040
<i>have again announced that there will
be no new models produced this year.</i>

211
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,186
<i>They have turned their entire
production capacities...</i>

212
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,821
<i>over to making chicken
poo converters.</i>

213
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,785
<i>To replace the gasoline
powered engines of the...</i>

214
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:54,587
<i>thousands of abandoned cars
that litter our highways.</i>

215
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:01,948
- Darling, Dr. Frankenstein is here.
- I'm not sick!

216
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:03,697
It's my life that's sick.

217
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,763
Here comes the famous faithful
old family doctor once again.

218
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
My dear...

219
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,935
I dropped everything!

220
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:17,366
The moment I heard that my
favorite little baby of all are sick.

221
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,450
Roll over.

222
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,504
I'm not a baby anymore.

223
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:23,145
I did.
I delivered it you.

224
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:27,562
- You'll always be a baby to me.
- That's not all you've delivered.

225
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:30,602
- Oh, so that's the trouble again.
- And it always will be.

226
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:32,423
<i>How long did you
say they would live?</i>

227
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,288
<i>- A day? Two days?
- I forget it.</i>

228
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:38,602
Two weeks?
Two months at most?

229
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,711
Oh, my dear.
Doctors don't know everything.

230
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:44,045
- We're not China men
- It's been 15 years.

231
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,867
Something is telling me
then I must see them.

232
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:48,685
You don't know
what they look like.

233
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:53,081
They have become so ugly.
I've hesitate even to describe them.

234
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,950
<i>Well, what about their intelligence?</i>

235
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,334
<i>Level with a cattle ups.
I'd say.</i>

236
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,898
- Cattle ups?
- Zucchinis then.

237
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,674
My dear,
they have each other.

238
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,823
You mustn't suppose they're
starved for affection,

239
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:11,080
They adore each other.
They even suck each other thumbs.

240
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,765
Only there was some sort of sign,
telling me what to do.

241
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,111
<i>- What's that?
- Something from outer space.</i>

242
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,010
<i>Take in the kitchen
you camera.</i>

243
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,183
<i>- It's a flying clamps.
- No, it's a fortune cookie.</i>

244
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,189
Hello Mrs. Swain.

245
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:56,160
How come you pay
no attention to the...

246
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:59,140
wonderful clue I give
to the American people.

247
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:00,894
Who are you?

248
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:04,304
I am Ah Fong, the former
Ambassador from China.

249
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,804
You didn't see me on
television 15 years ago?

250
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,972
Yes, yes we did.

251
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,601
You bet your ass you did.

252
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,215
We hit the highest Nielsen
rating for a low shot...

253
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,182
in the entire history
of the american television.

254
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:20,661
<i>I said that the reason
for success in...</i>

255
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:23,939
<i>Chinese science is twins,
now you have twins.</i>

256
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,783
You can't put two
and two together?

257
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,348
You know about our twins?

258
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,333
Then sad more than
you people do.

259
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,154
You have Wilbur and Eliza.

260
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:35,236
You have been spying on
my poor little monsters.

261
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,959
We found out in the
People's Republic of China...

262
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,668
if you put two lonely ugly not
good-for-nothing twins together,

263
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:46,122
for long enough time,
nighttime daytime,

264
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:48,172
you let them communicate,
they come out...

265
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:50,814
with a genius to put
Albert Einstein to shame.

266
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,432
Not my two.

267
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,374
We must get this together.

268
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,141
You people the way you are,
you're jacking down this entire planet.

269
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,953
Everybody conversation
turn to chicken shit.

270
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:04,647
Please come on with Chinese.
We're nice people.

271
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:07,195
We're not bad guys
We're just businessmen.

272
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:07,991
Right?

273
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:12,295
All we wanna do is negotiate,
a little contract for control the gravity.

274
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,949
And we want approval.
We want your approval.

275
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:18,152
<i>We want the people's approval.
We want the president's approval.</i>

276
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:21,713
You go in and call President,
now you tell that dumb son of bitch...

277
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:25,800
that a major natural resource
for this country is right here.

278
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,002
Wilbur and Eliza.

279
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,301
This is a sure queer planet.

280
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,037
where the main idea...

281
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:49,383
- is to be as dumb as possible.
- And if you're not dumb enough,

282
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,032
you just drinking
some more champagne.

283
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:56,287
And with all the champagne
Sylvester and servants drink,

284
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,671
they must be considered the
dumbest people in the world.

285
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,458
Yeah...

286
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,069
well you know what?

287
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,846
Sylvester says that mother and father...

288
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,866
are more stupid than they are.

289
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,308
I hope we had dumb
enough for then.

290
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,673
I want mother
and father to be proud of us.

291
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:19,330
Oh, they will be.

292
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,567
You want to hear some
Moliere and French?

293
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:31,231
- Physics?
- Physics!

294
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,073
- Physics.
- Physics.

295
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,325
- A theory of gravity.
- Okey-dokey.

296
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,184
Yeah, and you know.

297
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,825
That's about the best hiding
place we ever came up with.

298
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:45,941
- Sure is.
- Yeah.

299
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:56,390
Ah, our essay on beekeeping.

300
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:01,374
- That was lashed.
- This so easy too.

301
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,827
Oh, our essay
on how to cure...

302
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:08,223
the social troubles in America.

303
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:11,687
Is no obvious the solution.
Is just...

304
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:13,469
Oh! Our essay.

305
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:18,135
On the five variant
steps of waltz.

306
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,964
Oh. I love to dance with you.

307
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:15,364
Drop to young masters.

308
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:20,195
The indestructible twins.

309
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:25,697
I predict it will live to be
thousand years old.

310
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:45,961
Quentin, put me down.

311
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:48,462
Put me down, animal.

312
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,467
What's is that?

313
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:57,918
Telephone.

314
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:04,067
You can't be the neighbors,
to complains about noise.

315
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,937
We are having any neighbors.

316
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:09,954
- Hello.
- Hello.

317
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:12,028
- Hello, who's there?
- Sylvester speaking.

318
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,913
<i>Sylvester, is Mr. Caleb.
Caleb Rockefeller Swain.</i>

319
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,659
- Mr. Swain?
- Hello...

320
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:20,321
Is there anyone
here who called Mr...

321
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:23,990
<i>- Mr. Swain
- Sylvester.</i>

322
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:27,522
- How nice to hear your voice again, Sr.
- Yes.

323
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,707
Yes, well Sylvester, my wife
and I will be there tomorrow.

324
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:34,797
In the afternoon,
along with dr. Frankenstein...

325
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,732
and then we'll be meeting the
President of the United States.

326
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,734
And he'll have two Secret
Service men with him.

327
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:43,275
Yes, listen, if there's
anything we can do...

328
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:47,061
for their wonderful
and adorable children of just...

329
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:50,716
just tell and said
considered will be done.

330
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:53,446
- Have any Encyclopedia Britannica?
- Encyclopedia...

331
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,161
Any you monkeys who have
ordered an Encyclopedia Britannica?

332
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,211
<i>My brother-in-law used to self.</i>

333
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:00,974
That was two years ago.

334
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:08,869
The feeling was said, no child
should grow up in a home...

335
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,104
without the Encyclopedia
Britannica’s.

336
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,168
<i>Oh, course,
very good.</i>

337
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,807
You're right about the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

338
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:18,435
Absolutely right,
they have a set there.

339
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:21,807
Yes, and your children have
read it 10 times through.

340
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:25,636
I know, because our most reliable
agent has been watching it.

341
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:29,532
- The cook?
- Of course the cook.

342
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,585
I knew his face was familiar.

343
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,191
When I asked him if he's
a communist he said no.

344
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,596
Yes, well you see he
was under orders to lie.

345
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:40,570
What is the world coming to, when
you can't even trust the Chinese.

346
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,375
Look, you people go and can
acquainted with your children.

347
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:48,718
And we'll come back real soon
and then we make a big deal...

348
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,538
for the controller gravity, okay?

349
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,910
Well, we just felt that we had to see our
children in spite of what they became.

350
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,359
There must have been days
of light gravity in olden time.

351
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,832
And people play tiddlywinks
with huge chunks of stone.

352
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:13,466
Or inhabitants from
other planets help them.

353
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:16,551
Showing them the way
to neutralize gravity.

354
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,951
How does our essay on
gravity begin again?

355
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:24,538
With an apple hitting Sir
Isaac Newton on the head.

356
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,647
How much gasoline we use?

357
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:31,605
You better hit the sports car.

358
00:26:31,753 --> 00:26:33,496
I'll get out the horse's leg.

359
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,443
Get the Kawasaki
out of there.

360
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,652
Mildred, take your panties
down up the flagpole.

361
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:46,492
And run up a flurry.
It's a mess.

362
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:51,251
I must worry like this.
I could wrinkles around my eyes.

363
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,950
- Your cocktails, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

364
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,742
<i>Wait, throw it again.</i>

365
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,226
Mr. President, we'll be landing
our destination at 1200 hours.

366
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,182
Thank you, Anson.

367
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:27,991
That's lieutenant, sir.
This is an airplane, not a boat.

368
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:29,872
Oh yeah,
I keep forgetting.

369
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,640
The depressive duty,
you know.

370
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:32,871
At ease, at ease.

371
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,770
It certainly is exciting to
re-establish contact with...

372
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,064
the People's Republic of
China after all these years.

373
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:41,968
Yes ensign, but they make
me feel like such a jackass.

374
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:45,075
So far behind them is bicycle
contraceptive jelly name...

375
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:48,718
It they've named
a slash to the mast.

376
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,799
This must be a very
important mission.

377
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,548
It's in the lap of the gods.

378
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,423
Is everything all right
with you, Mr. President?

379
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,220
Yes, yes, of course ensign.

380
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,590
It just seems like there's
something troubling you.

381
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:03,233
So embarrassing,
this airplane,

382
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,047
Air Force One.

383
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:07,852
One once a symbol
of a great nation.

384
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,691
Powered by chicken shit.

385
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:13,045
Well we'd be walking if it
wasn't for chicken stuff?

386
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,611
Yes, I guess I am grateful
for the damn stuff.

387
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,211
Well as you Navy people say,

388
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:22,317
Dawn the torpedoes Ridley
and full steam ahead.

389
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,159
Dismissed.

390
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,824
I like that boy.

391
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,404
Sure... madam.

392
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:40,063
Your faithful and
obedient servants...

393
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,423
hope you are well service.

394
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,034
"Bon appétit".

395
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:01,846
To think that our children
may actually be intelligent.

396
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:04,410
Why wouldn't maybe?

397
00:31:04,411 --> 00:31:06,968
They come from perfectly
marvelous stock.

398
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:09,552
Ford's, the Vanderpool's,
the Rockefeller's.

399
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,059
I hope that it's alright for the
President to land on that old airstrip.

400
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,940
That's why we've
got a vice president.

401
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:38,652
"Oh lŕ lŕ" you both
look so very nice.

402
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,722
The perfect ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,852
<i>Your parents would
be really proud of you.</i>

404
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:50,319
Just think, soon you'll be meeting
the President of the United States.

405
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,513
My lord, my lady how wonderful
to meet you at last.

406
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,652
Oh, we're not Lord
and Lady today.

407
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:13,631
No, no, of course.
Silly of me.

408
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,209
The president is already
ensconce to the library.

409
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:17,591
Sylvester.

410
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:19,458
Oh doctor how
distinguished to look.

411
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:22,619
- May I take your briefcase
- No thank you, I'll keep it.

412
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:26,968
I have some intelligence tests.
I will give to the children.

413
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:30,491
The children. Yes, excellent, excellent.
Good idea, Sir.

414
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,081
That class of chimpanzees.

415
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:47,310
The doctor has brought you
some intelligence tests.

416
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,655
Can you imagine that?

417
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:54,637
Does a horse have
a feathers or hair?

418
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:58,787
The horse has quills
Like a porcupine.

419
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:00,910
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

420
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:06,373
I wonder if it's time to teach you
the words for Mama and Papa.

421
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,673
<i>Say Papa.</i>

422
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,032
Say Mama.

423
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,078
Church, I got it.

424
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,308
Would you like some apple
cider, Mr. President.

425
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:27,216
Is this all rest drink
in a house?

426
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,265
Oh I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. President.

427
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,175
I should have thought to
bring something along.

428
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,840
<i>But you see,
Dr. Frankenstein gathered...</i>

429
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:35,145
together this staff of people
to take care of the children.

430
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,768
They all hate alcohol.

431
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,310
Distingued Sir, my
lady, Mr. President...

432
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,791
<i>the children are ready.</i>

433
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,084
Are the children really so smart?

434
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:48,262
You must be the
Judge of them.

435
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,481
I've come love so it isn't
possible for me to be objective.

436
00:33:52,482 --> 00:33:56,294
Well the Chinese are the greatest
resources country as today.

437
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,098
And note the Chinese cannot been mistake.
Anybody, anything don't miss.

438
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,355
I'm so proud.

439
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:10,137
Without further I do.

440
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,801
May I present master Wilbur...

441
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,314
and Mistress Eliza.

442
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:45,970
Children these
are your parents.

443
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,873
<i>And this is the President
of the United States.</i>

444
00:34:56,874 --> 00:35:01,074
<i>Second most powerful and richest
nation in the whole world.</i>

445
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:08,103
- Oh please God, let me faint.
- Me too.

446
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,802
Come on kids, you can
do better than this.

447
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:15,510
I want you to give them a
welcome they will never forget.

448
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,167
- Maria?
- "Oui, madam".

449
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,183
Where are the children now?

450
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,225
- Beyond their bedroom
- Are they all right?

451
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:11,841
I don't know madam, they
were sprayed with mace.

452
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,936
That was necessary
I suppose?

453
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:17,986
So we think.

454
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:19,671
Well has it ever before?

455
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:22,064
I don't think so.

456
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:23,700
Then it was all our fault?

457
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:28,820
<i>How could I
have given birth...</i>

458
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,854
to two drooling totem poles.

459
00:38:32,522 --> 00:38:34,386
It couldn't be helped darling,
that's all in the past.

460
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:37,913
What a cruel joke for
the Chinese to play.

461
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,227
What was the point of that?

462
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:42,114
They don't think like
a great of people.

463
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:44,277
A gullible.

464
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:48,500
I actually believe that they would
be spouting Latin, Greek and...

465
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,121
- algebra, literature...
- Spanish, literature.

466
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,112
I was gullible too.
I feel just like you.

467
00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:22,812
Quickly, get the mace.

468
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,238
No! No.

469
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:27,439
I want talk to them.

470
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:29,449
You can't, madam.

471
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,053
They could reach your head of.

472
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,262
I am your mother.

473
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:45,257
<i>Not that you know
what mother means.</i>

474
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:49,336
<i>And your mother is
leaving you now forever.</i>

475
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:52,788
If they're having the least...

476
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,447
flicker of intelligence
in your are the...

477
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:59,543
least syllable of
language on your lips...

478
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,466
I came here with,
the sort of maybe.

479
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:05,376
Starting over again
and beginning...

480
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:07,857
of them we have
some sort just...

481
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:12,192
It's cruel and stupid of me
to insist on this little sign.

482
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:15,237
If I can truly love you,
and I just...

483
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,514
Well, I have nothing but
contempt for myself.

484
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,098
Good luck...

485
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,447
and goodbye.

486
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:36,649
<i>Mother?</i>

487
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,579
Oh God, what a time
to die by accident.

488
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,858
Mother dear?

489
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:47,069
- Mother, look at us please.
- Mr. and Mrs. Swain.

490
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,041
Mr. and Mrs. Caleb
Rockefeller Swain.

491
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:55,418
<i>From 229 Peacock,
Santa Barbara, California.</i>

492
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,723
I'm so scared.

493
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:58,409
Be not afraid, mother.

494
00:40:58,554 --> 00:41:01,244
We bring you tidings
of great joy.

495
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:04,107
Listen, we are not dumb.

496
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:07,371
We just thought that
you will want it very...

497
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:09,829
much for us to be as
dumb as possible.

498
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:14,122
(speaking French)

499
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:17,073
This is a very wee planet.

500
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,866
It's just so confusing for us
because it's good to be dumb...

501
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,625
and it's bad to be smart.

502
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:25,149
You know, do as the Romans do.

503
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,011
when you in Rome,
is not headed back with.

504
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:32,365
I swear this is
the first sign...

505
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,898
of intelligent life
never an observed in.

506
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,519
Any time we showed what you
found some way to put it out.

507
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,748
Yeah.

508
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:45,420
I have some intelligence tests. So
we find out what we have here got.

509
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:50,037
All this just totally turned
my world, upside down.

510
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:55,162
And by George, the whole
family are reunited.

511
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,449
- Wait my sister.
- Don't worried about her.

512
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,059
Well, we've never
been apart before.

513
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:12,547
Hey, this feels terrible.
I've been cutting half.

514
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:14,669
You'll have to get
used to, don't you?

515
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:19,436
You know. I feel
dumb without Eliza.

516
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:23,539
Start.

517
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,728
Well, I have to confess that
I've rather underestimated...

518
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:16,863
the intelligence of
the twins in the past.

519
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,187
I apologize for that.

520
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,903
You know, a few of these
tests I've just made.

521
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,509
I didn't miss by all that much.

522
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,140
<i>It's true that this boy has
learned to read and write.</i>

523
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:29,822
Which I suppose wiser about
ten times as smart as the girl.

524
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:34,592
But incidentally they both said that
a horse has quills like a porcupine.

525
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:38,400
- A horse has hair.
- good for you.

526
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,381
I feel as though life
has used me as a yo-yo.

527
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,071
You know, the boy should
go to a military academy.

528
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:48,461
He'll learned discipline there and he'd
learned how to relate to other people.

529
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:51,749
Very good one is
about 50 miles from here.

530
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,115
It's run by an
old friend of mine.

531
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:57,587
- What about the girl?
- I think the girl should stay here.

532
00:43:57,588 --> 00:43:59,552
I mean in familiar surroundings.

533
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:01,776
You could cut way
down on the stop.

534
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,398
What you did to
make her happy?

535
00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:08,779
a box of crayons,
a doll, yeah.

536
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,669
I'd better mosey on back
to the White House.

537
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,938
<i>I had a wonderful time here.</i>

538
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:15,532
I awfully sorry that our
babies weren't smarter.

539
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,688
Yeah, well, we gave it a shot.

540
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:20,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:26,121
We would like to take
the test over again.

542
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:29,255
- That's hardly necessary.
- Would like to take it together.

543
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,983
If you would let us
sit side-by-side.

544
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:35,791
No! I'm perfectly satisfied with
the results as they are.

545
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:39,760
Now just a minute. I might
be a simple soul from Illinois.

546
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:42,448
But I also happen to be president
of a once great nation.

547
00:44:43,023 --> 00:44:46,194
Whose entire economy
is powered by chicken shit.

548
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:49,357
Now, if you, two kids think
you can perform some...

549
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:51,347
<i>kind of miracle by putting
your heads together.</i>

550
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:53,770
I for one would like to see it.

551
00:44:54,218 --> 00:44:58,776
Tell me, how can I get
America running again?

552
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:37,232
Children you have to do that?
Surely you can think without...

553
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,463
We don't understand.

554
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:45,813
May also such thing
as be in too close.

555
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:48,821
There is...

556
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:52,302
Especially for brothers
and sisters you see its...

557
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:59,975
Caleb tell the children
about... the incest... taboo.

558
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,710
Yes, my darling.

559
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:05,118
The incest taboo back
in the olden times in...

560
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,227
Egypt and King Arthur
novel and all of that.

561
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,952
People noticed that when
relatives married and had babies.

562
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:17,275
The children usually turn
down dumb and funny-looking.

563
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,429
Oh! So your and mother
were relatives?

564
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:23,415
Of course not, why would you
ask such a stupid question?

565
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,566
Well because my sister
and I are preach.

566
00:46:27,572 --> 00:46:30,239
I think this conversation
has gone askew some way.

567
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,874
Uh, just to try a little harder
to keep your hands to yourself.

568
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,037
Try a little harder.

569
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,050
See the president just
asked a question...

570
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:39,978
that's the hardest one
we ever had to answer.

571
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:42,504
Well what do you need to
do to answer the question?

572
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:45,064
Take of your shoes.

573
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,573
And embrace?

574
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,604
So exchange touch.

575
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:53,880
That's it!
That's it!

576
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,488
All right.
That's all liked it.

577
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:57,224
Pushed.
You learn to lead.

578
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:59,675
Get the police get hold
of servants, I'm Busy!

579
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:01,970
- I've pushed!
- Is all over!

580
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:10,116
Use the stray jackets.

581
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,984
There are some sacrifices
that no citizens should...

582
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:23,547
ever have to make for
his or her country.

583
00:47:37,537 --> 00:47:39,886
What's that wagon
doing out there?

584
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:42,251
They delivering ice cream?

585
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:46,097
That's right, ice cream,
they delivering ice cream.

586
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:48,778
I like ice cream.

587
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:56,634
Guys, why you tell me
what this is all about?

588
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,292
We gonna make you
a man, are you kid?

589
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:00,322
Who's that bound
to happen anyway?

590
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:03,616
- With my sister.
- Forget about your sister, kid.

591
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,403
Okay where's the ladies,
she's my mother?

592
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:08,914
She's gone.
She don’t wanna cry.

593
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,901
Why, there's something
to cry about?

594
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,140
Hey, there is something
very sad happening here.

595
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:16,274
If Eliza was here she
would tell me what was.

596
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:20,764
<i>Hey, why lock me here?
What is happening?</i>

597
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:24,118
Eliza!

598
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:26,591
Wilbur!

599
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:34,935
Wilbur, wait for me!

600
00:48:47,977 --> 00:48:49,806
They're trying to separate us.

601
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,455
Its close...

602
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,298
- Just a little...
- My head!

603
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,809
There goes my life.

604
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,350
There's nothing I can do about.

605
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,835
Eliza, Eliza. Quick, they try to
separating us. Eliza.

606
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:35,649
Eliza.

607
00:49:50,415 --> 00:49:54,982
Miss Eliza, everything will
probably be well again.

608
00:49:56,528 --> 00:49:57,528
Why I'm crying?

609
00:49:58,487 --> 00:49:59,487
Try don't worry about.

610
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:05,692
I can't think my brain just
seems to be... flying away.

611
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:10,308
Come, come in. He has
better there, you see.

612
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:12,154
You shall only...

613
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:19,697
<i>- It'd appear the plan is failing.
- Do not be so quick to judge.</i>

614
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:22,548
<i>They have touched the
heart of Sylvester.</i>

615
00:50:22,684 --> 00:50:24,631
<i>Soon we may be able
to reach others.</i>

616
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,942
<i>And with love,
comes understanding.</i>

617
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:30,827
<i>Let's be patient a little longer.</i>

618
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,245
- Mr. Swain.
- Colonel Sharp.

619
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:15,246
How do you do?

620
00:51:16,013 --> 00:51:17,013
How do you do?

621
00:51:22,674 --> 00:51:23,585
I cannot believe it.

622
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:26,715
He looked like a
loser few weeks ago.

623
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,846
Ah he still looks like
a loser, Mrs. Swain.

624
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:31,819
That's why we had to give him
that disguise first day here.

625
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:35,169
Get everybody out of
there which, specially me.

626
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:42,801
Colonel, is that real
instructor Chinese?

627
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:45,463
You're a great
judge of character.

628
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:48,883
He is Chinese.
The best instructor we have.

629
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:54,488
Looks like a cook we have
turned out to be a communist spy.

630
00:51:55,284 --> 00:51:59,316
Don't you worry about that.
I had him checked out myself.

631
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,320
Cadet Swain.
one step forward.

632
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:32,495
Step!

633
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:35,787
Who is the biggest
cry baby in this outfit.

634
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:41,315
Cadet Wilbur Rockefeller
Wayne, sir.

635
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,620
He cry all night and every
night for his sister?

636
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:48,315
- Yeah! Yes, yes, sir.
- Okay cadet Wayne,

637
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:52,553
you tell us.
What's the name of his sister.

638
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:56,136
I can't remember, sir.

639
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:59,384
Very good. Cadet Swain
one step backward.

640
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,625
- What one?
- Step!

641
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:09,587
It’s a miracle he can't
remember his sister's name.

642
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,807
<i>No miracle about,
Mrs. Wayne.</i>

643
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,496
We deprive them of sleep
and if they wet their bed...

644
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:20,507
we use electric type.

645
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:23,583
I would wish that there was
a place it here, for Eliza.

646
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,042
Perhaps if you poured something
spaghetti sauce on me.

647
00:53:50,012 --> 00:53:51,012
Carefully.

648
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,543
Oh, It’s so funny with
both in the face.

649
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,879
<i>Oh please sleep in your own
room instead of the Attic.</i>

650
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:09,607
There are bats there.

651
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:14,018
They are my friends.

652
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:17,492
That's our animals that
God made for ugly people.

653
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:23,204
- At least put a reading light.
- I can't read.

654
00:54:23,236 --> 00:54:25,471
I would be glad
to read to you.

655
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:27,303
<i>I could concentrate.</i>

656
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,083
You're not the
missing half of me.

657
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:48,548
If these walls could speak,
what stories they could tell.

658
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,836
We got some more
liquor in the basement.

659
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:14,646
Sure, I Think we
could fall down...

660
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:18,576
wake up with our
heads in the toilet.

661
00:55:20,729 --> 00:55:25,180
Drink doesn't solve
any problems.

662
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,540
We are more fun than that.

663
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,162
Joy of ignorance.

664
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:44,040
Enjoy have not knowing that
anything important is going on.

665
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:52,326
We thought we were
superior to twins.

666
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:56,001
If you thought the only thing.

667
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:03,250
And all the way, we live together,
they were...

668
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:07,378
cute and loving and
forgiving presence.

669
00:56:11,664 --> 00:56:13,973
I was too dumb to know it.

670
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:17,165
Well we don't have
to get drunk.

671
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:20,261
We still got three thousand
gallons of gasoline.

672
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,686
Probably the last gasoline
in the whole world.

673
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,938
The car still runs,
you can take a spin.

674
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,758
What a shallow idea of
fun you have, Quinn.

675
00:56:39,703 --> 00:56:42,521
Well. I'm not going to sit around
here and mope like you.

676
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:45,810
Maybe those twins are wonderful
when they were together.

677
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:49,664
But that girl up there
is just plain dumb.

678
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,015
Oh, My!

679
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,432
Any more funny stuff we're gonna
blow the shit out of you.

680
00:58:03,433 --> 00:58:05,819
We have the former
ambassador, Ah Fong here.

681
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,487
I didn't know.

682
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:09,982
Fong throwing around
like a damn ping pong ball.

683
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:12,525
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

684
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:14,928
You think you're sorry?
We all butter up in here.

685
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,768
That wasn't all
my fault, wasn't?

686
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:19,341
Shit your pants on.

687
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:21,822
Ah Fong wants speak to you.

688
00:58:29,588 --> 00:58:33,149
Are you the same Chinese
man or a different one.

689
00:58:33,397 --> 00:58:35,797
Oh yeah, very different
Chinese man.

690
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:38,419
Wouldn't really have
zapped me woody?

691
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,790
Oh yes,
it’s necessary.

692
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,256
I'm afraid.

693
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:44,496
Oh, don't be afraid I
come with good news.

694
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,603
See you go to your brother the two of...

695
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:48,691
you get together you
can be smart again.

696
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,589
Then everything
gonna be okay.

697
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,680
Then we make a deal for
control the gravity.

698
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:55,657
Where is my brother?

699
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:59,224
The Custer Military
School for screwed boys.

700
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:00,989
50 miles from here.

701
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,903
- I should start walking
- Oh no need to walk.

702
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:06,966
By outside the house
here under bales of straw...

703
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:10,013
is a brand-new Ferrari
all gasp stop ready to go.

704
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,343
I don't think I can drive.

705
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:15,248
<i>Any fool can drive you
just put key ignition,</i>

706
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:18,279
turn the key, push the
gas pedal and you're on.

707
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:21,321
What's that?

708
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:24,859
My car!

709
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:38,690
Nice.

710
00:59:58,334 --> 01:00:00,266
- Wilbur!
- Who's there?

711
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,013
Hold!

712
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,310
<i>Wilbur!</i>

713
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:09,806
Please, hold.

714
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,965
<i>I want to see my brother.</i>

715
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:14,978
I can't let anyone
in without permission.

716
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,552
<i>His name is Wilbur Swain.</i>

717
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:23,548
You tell him to come here,
you telling his sister is here.

718
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:25,666
<i>oh I know.
You're his sister.</i>

719
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:29,028
We're twins.

720
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:30,336
<i>Take a look!</i>

721
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,173
Wilbur!

722
01:00:57,782 --> 01:00:58,763
So what did you say?

723
01:00:58,847 --> 01:00:59,841
So I told General Patton:

724
01:00:59,842 --> 01:01:02,752
"Georgie you just took
the wrong goddamn Hill".

725
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,445
Here's a study hall.

726
01:01:04,446 --> 01:01:06,230
Well. I just had to come
to see for myself.

727
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:09,138
You know, Wilbur parents told me
how much you done for the boy.

728
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:11,706
Well. They promised us a
brand new gymnasium.

729
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,737
Oh, they did?
They're certainly good for it.

730
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:15,397
They're the only
patients I've got.

731
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:19,343
Wilbur!

732
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,650
Wilbur, it’s me!

733
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,364
- Colonel Sharp!
- Yes, sergeant.

734
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:31,499
You want in the infirmary.

735
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,392
So this happened
to cadet Stravinsky.

736
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:35,505
His hair was suddenly white,
and he can't talk anymore.

737
01:01:35,506 --> 01:01:37,188
All right.
I'll be right with you.

738
01:01:37,189 --> 01:01:40,627
I'd appreciate very much if you come
and take a look at silence Stravinsky...

739
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,690
before I put that Wickham
right into the mutant platton.

740
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:46,338
Well keep up the
good work, Wilbur.

741
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,618
No wonder your
parents don't like you.

742
01:02:15,003 --> 01:02:19,013
If I had kids like you...
I hate you.

743
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:22,753
I don't hate you.
I love you.

744
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:37,949
<i>Where are you going?
Come back. Stop.</i>

745
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:58,173
Don't be afraid, Wilbur.
This is your sister.

746
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:01,826
God Wilbur, what
if they done to you?

747
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:04,465
What have they done to us?

748
01:04:05,156 --> 01:04:07,320
- Men.
- Yes, sir.

749
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,912
- Do you have their sunglasses?
- Yes, sir.

750
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,490
Put them on.

751
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:14,239
I don't want you to see them
or your hair will turn white.

752
01:04:14,302 --> 01:04:17,223
You'll get a stroke.
Let me see your weapon.

753
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:24,050
Civilians. Back road.
Catch them.

754
01:04:31,582 --> 01:04:35,547
Oh stalks, they're coming
after us with dogs.

755
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,482
God. I'm getting smarter
all the time just...

756
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:42,513
being close to you
are you been smart too?

757
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:44,601
Let´s on this.
Pull it!

758
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:54,108
Please answer me.

759
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:04,738
Please.

760
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:11,076
That's not about it, and help
me figure out what to do.

761
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:35,440
I love you.
I can't live without you.

762
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:41,597
If we can't be together
as one just rather...

763
01:05:41,598 --> 01:05:43,728
wait here and eaten by dogs.

764
01:05:54,102 --> 01:05:55,197
What?

765
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,760
No, so no more.

766
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:05,914
My social scheme what everybody
could be happy and loving all the time.

767
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,854
Are you saying about our social
reform do you remember they're...

768
01:06:08,855 --> 01:06:11,483
happy and loving all the time
no matter what the situation is.

769
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,655
Is utopia where everybody in
a country has ten thousand...

770
01:06:15,656 --> 01:06:18,892
sisters and brothers and
a hundred thousand cousins.

771
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:23,126
Everyone could be a should
new little name consisting of a noun.

772
01:06:23,581 --> 01:06:27,601
- Name of a flower or fruit.
- Or not a vegetable or gem...

773
01:06:28,181 --> 01:06:30,612
or bird or fish or mineral.

774
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:34,079
With a hyphen to a
number between 1 and 20.

775
01:06:34,563 --> 01:06:36,949
And anyone that would have
the same middle name.

776
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,153
Such as uranium.

777
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:42,184
Would be cousins and anyone with the
same number will be brothers and sisters.

778
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:46,473
Anywhere you would go and this big
country about you would have a relative.

779
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,923
So that if you are finding with someone
chances are you would be in own family.

780
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,584
You are okay
now, huh, Wilbur?

781
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:55,533
But they gave me compulsive
shock treatment which

782
01:06:55,534 --> 01:06:58,894
accounted for my lack of
intelligence that I experienced.

783
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:01,423
The Chinese have gotten
us back together again...

784
01:07:01,424 --> 01:07:04,718
in hopes of learning from us the final
equation for the modification and...

785
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:08,002
and control of the
gravitational atmosphere.

786
01:07:08,003 --> 01:07:11,115
They would then master
the entire world.

787
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:14,132
Yes, but we cannot go
to our parents because...

788
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:17,115
they lacked the intelligence
and initiative we need.

789
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,417
We need to deal
with this situation.

790
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:22,110
The president although
a nice man from...

791
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:25,001
Rochefort is too influenced
by those around him.

792
01:07:25,189 --> 01:07:29,337
And dr. Frankenstein is threatened by us
and he would like to separate us again.

793
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:30,133
So we must...

794
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:34,674
go back to the mansion finish
our essay on gravity and...

795
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:39,824
and escape to someplace where
we can hide and hope we can...

796
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:43,908
live together in
peace and happiness,

797
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:45,564
Yeah.

798
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:50,283
<i>Hurry Wilbur, hurry.</i>

799
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:10,741
Master Wilbur...
Mistress Eliza.

800
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:32,587
Colonel Sharp, sir. We have the enemy
trap behind his fault to door, sir.

801
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:34,159
Put dogs out.

802
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:40,228
Now I gave you
wet noses balls.

803
01:08:41,095 --> 01:08:43,974
Put down then
dammed obstacle.

804
01:08:47,379 --> 01:08:49,561
Stop. Pull you back.

805
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,556
You!

806
01:08:52,557 --> 01:08:53,557
<i>Boy.</i>

807
01:08:56,764 --> 01:09:00,462
Now what in goddamn
hell is behind that obstacle?

808
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:04,377
Nothing, sir. There are children's
dining room, Mr. "Shop".

809
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:06,521
Mr. Sharp.
Is colonel Sharp.

810
01:09:06,522 --> 01:09:08,818
A Sharp, or Sir!

811
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:11,817
Yes, sir. A Sharp.

812
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,744
Its totally encased in steel.

813
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:18,043
It was built at a time
when the children...

814
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:19,728
<i>were believed
to be dangerous.</i>

815
01:09:20,469 --> 01:09:22,203
There is no way in.

816
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,102
- Blast it!
- We must not harm the boy.

817
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,753
Now, it's goodbye to
the gymnasium.

818
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:39,745
Hold up now!

819
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:45,997
I don't want to
lose that damn gym.

820
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,952
Cadet Swain?

821
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,183
Cadet Swain!

822
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:55,813
This is the direct command.

823
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:58,919
<i>You come out right now
and there's not be casualties.</i>

824
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,404
And about my sister?

825
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:02,265
Oh, we'll take
good care of her.

826
01:10:02,635 --> 01:10:06,128
Hell, we even got your
family doctor. Wilbur.

827
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,293
<i>Dr. Frankenstein?</i>

828
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:10,800
Wilbur, you remember me now.

829
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:12,861
Oh, I certainly do.

830
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:17,746
I've taken care of you since you
were knee-high to a grasshopper...

831
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,057
to an elephant.

832
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:21,288
You never knew anything
about either one of us.

833
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:23,623
You self-serving fraud.

834
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:25,485
Your sister told to
you said that?

835
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:28,917
She's probably told you to say that
and the other rude and ungrateful things.

836
01:10:29,553 --> 01:10:31,435
Wilbur, as your family
doctor I order you...

837
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,407
to come out of there
and get away from her.

838
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,443
No! We never be part again.

839
01:10:35,836 --> 01:10:38,274
We would rather die
than be parted.

840
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,131
Wilbur, we have to
concentrate harder.

841
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:49,974
Maybe if we can fully understand
how to control gravity.

842
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:52,622
We can somehow
get out of here.

843
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:55,883
I'm not very good
under pressure.

844
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:07,552
That's although the
experimental tenant...

845
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:09,946
of general relativity
will not fully conclude.

846
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:12,623
Wait a minute, call back to
the part about the photon.

847
01:11:12,624 --> 01:11:15,765
Yeah! Depending only upon a
conservation of energy and...

848
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:19,490
mass of a proton of energy
being E over C squared.

849
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:22,807
That's where Einstein
made his mistake.

850
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,580
He got the mass of
a photon wrong.

851
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:28,353
I know it. I can feel it.
I can smell it.

852
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:31,572
- Well, you never been wrong yet.
- I know I'm right.

853
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,559
We can go right where
Einstein went wrong.

854
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,948
We're so close.
We're so close

855
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:38,976
- Hold me.
- Yes.

856
01:12:01,102 --> 01:12:02,818
<i>Oh no, please.
Don't stop.</i>

857
01:12:03,456 --> 01:12:06,103
On the contrary, we want
you to stay together.

858
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:08,633
And stay smart as
you can possibly be.

859
01:12:09,114 --> 01:12:11,294
<i>We want to take you
to China with us.</i>

860
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:15,022
We're not going
anywhere with you.

861
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:17,748
<i>I'm afraid you have no choice.</i>

862
01:12:18,346 --> 01:12:21,340
After all, we are the most
powerful people in the world.

863
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:25,562
If we wanted to, we could bless
you to smithereens right here.

864
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:27,938
It couldn't help you
from the outsider.

865
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:29,574
<i>Nobody can help you.</i>

866
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:33,156
So please you just
give us the equation...

867
01:12:33,157 --> 01:12:36,143
to gravity and
come to China with us.

868
01:12:36,806 --> 01:12:39,213
<i>Otherwise we blow
you away, right here.</i>

869
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,321
- We would rather die.
- We would rather die.

870
01:12:43,469 --> 01:12:47,108
Just like Americans always
the wrong decisions.

871
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,121
So be it.

872
01:13:59,709 --> 01:14:03,937
<i>Wilbur, Eliza,
do not be afraid.</i>

873
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:10,012
<i>Chinese men,
put down your weapons.</i>

874
01:14:12,418 --> 01:14:13,418
You are you?

875
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:16,059
<i>Someone who blow
you away, steward.</i>

876
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:19,317
Just asking.

877
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:26,957
<i>Twins, follow the light.</i>

878
01:14:27,871 --> 01:14:29,445
<i>It's time to go home.</i>

879
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:04,407
<i>Welcome, Wilbur and Eliza.</i>

880
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:06,936
<i>You are very special to us.</i>

881
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:10,048
<i>We had hope the people
of this planet would have...</i>

882
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:12,666
<i>benefited from your superior
wisdom and knowledge.</i>

883
01:15:13,206 --> 01:15:16,280
<i>There are to many Earthlings
were afraid of the unknown.</i>

884
01:15:18,777 --> 01:15:22,531
<i>We cannot help them until they learn
the true language of the universe.</i>

885
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:25,416
<i>And stop seeing
and hearing with...</i>

886
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:28,008
<i>their eyes and
ears begin to listen...</i>

887
01:15:28,686 --> 01:15:29,686
<i>the hearts.</i>

888
01:15:30,268 --> 01:15:32,269
<i>We Will have to
hope they do not...</i>

889
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:35,424
<i>cause too much trouble
to the universe, until then.</i>

890
01:15:42,902 --> 01:15:45,640
Come.
Let's go home.

891
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:23,875
