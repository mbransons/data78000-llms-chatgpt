how about me naming the band?
All right.

165
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,488
The Eleven Dixie Mudcats.

166
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,099
Hi, Roy.

167
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,205
That is not
what he said.

168
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,040
He said you've got
to pay me $1800 a month

169
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,308
on an every-month basis,

170
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,777
not just
every now and then.

171
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,612
How much do I owe you?
You're back five months,

172
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,146
and you wrote me a check,
and it bounced.

173
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,648
Bounced?
The bank must've screwed up.

174
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,316
I sent it back to you.
It bounced again.

175
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,685
I'll write you
another check.

176
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,452
Honey, how do I know
that ain't gonna bounce?

177
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,288
Anita, I'm not intentionally
gonna write you a check

178
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,522
that will bounce.

179
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,057
Doc, what happens
to all your money?

180
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,026
Good morning.

181
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,395
I drove my blind brother
Tommy 2000 miles

182
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,130
on prayers to God
you'd listen to his song.

183
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,231
I'm listening.

184
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,300
Hit it, Tommy.

185
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,002
Listen to me, Doc.

186
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,039
I'm talking about rent money,
car payments, food, and clothes.

187
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,173
I don't understand

188
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,542
how I got behind
in your alimony.

189
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,711
I'll damn sure bet

190
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,245
you ain't behind
in Honey Carder's alimony.

191
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,148
She never asked for any.

192
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,183
Mm, Doc...

193
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,353
You know, I think you loved me
about 10 percent of the time,

194
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,522
hated me
about 10 percent of the time.

195
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,926
I never hated you.
I couldn't hate anybody.

196
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,694
Oh, yeah?
You hate Rodeo Rocky.

197
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,362
I've never hated
a real human being.

198
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,164
When are you
gonna grow up

199
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,833
and be a responsible
person?

200
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,368
I'm president
of my own publishing company,

201
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,569
got my own studio.

202
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,104
How grown up do I have to be?

203
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,007
You know, I think you and I
probably just got married

204
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,443
the wrong year and a half
of our lives,

205
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,912
and I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

206
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,347
Oh, Doc.

207
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,550
Why did I leave you?

208
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,920
Why did I leave you?

209
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,922
I left you.

210
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,091
Doc, that Cajun creep
is here.

211
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,793
All right, Mulreaux,
send him in.

212
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,361
and get Hogan over here.

213
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,897
Well, you take the ITC,
you deduct all the interest.

214
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,099
You write off your fuel
and your maintenance--

215
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,367
I don't care about--

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,969
How much money
are you talking about?

217
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,103
Hogan,
you know Mulreaux.

218
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,371
Mulreaux,
you know Hogan.

219
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,039
Hey, Hogan.
How d'you do, my friend.

220
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,808
Chicken-fried
German food to go.

221
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,142
That was a long time ago.

222
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,711
Uh, Doc, did you
want to see me,

223
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,212
because I need
to see you too.

224
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,147
Okay, look,
write out a check

225
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:18,085
to my friend Mulreaux here
for $20,000.

226
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,152
Doc, I can't do that.

227
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,954
That's corporation
funds.

228
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,123
Rodeo Rocky just put the clamp
on the Cowbird Music money.

229
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,659
How can he do that? I'm the
president of the company.

230
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,327
HOGAN: You sold him
the company.

231
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,229
Oh, bullshit. He's just
in as an investor.

232
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,430
That's not what
the contract says.

233
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,598
You sell something
to somebody,

234
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,300
they own it.
You work for him.

235
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,968
I don't want to hear that.
How about $15,000?

236
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,470
That's the best damn news
I heard all day.

237
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,572
Here comes--

238
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,108
[BOTH SHOUTING]

239
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,342
[CHUCKLES,
WALKS AWAY]

240
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,510
Doc, I wouldn't
trust him

241
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,278
as far as we could
throw him.

242
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,247
I want to know how come
Anita's checks are bouncing.

243
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,581
Well, Rodeo Rocky
put a stop

244
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,017
to the Anita situation.

245
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,184
That son of a bitch.

246
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,485
Well, you sold him
the company!

247
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,987
Watch me
repossess it.

248
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,256
You'd better keep both eyes
on that son of a bitch,

249
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,325
because he's crazier
than you are.

250
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,461
Uh, Doc...

251
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,996
I want to talk to you.

252
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,197
Yeah, well,
go ahead.

253
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,365
Get this asshole
out of here.

254
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,499
He stays.
Who is he?

255
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,868
Purvis, Lionel Purvis.

256
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,502
He's the new comptroller
for Cowbird Music.

257
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,504
Well, you're just the prick
I want to talk to.

258
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,940
How come my checks
are bouncing?

259
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,374
You haven't been living up
your contract.

260
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,642
Who said?
I do.

261
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,044
He also turned down payment

262
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,511
on all those vouchers

263
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,948
for them invisible musicians
in that so-called superband.

264
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,816
Cut your
expense accounts too.

265
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,818
Yeah, he's gonna keep
bouncing checks to your ex-wife

266
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,453
until you live up
to our deal.

267
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,121
Some deal.
It's more like a goddamn ambush.

268
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,291
Hey, Doc, you live in
some kind of a western fantasy.

269
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,027
You ain't Doc Holliday.
You're Doc Jenkins.

270
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,695
I'll get you a drink.

271
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,231
I don't want a drink.
I want my goddamn contract back.

272
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,566
How much?

273
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,801
Hey, Doc...

274
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,236
Remember the old days,
when you and Blackie Buck

275
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,405
first came to Nashville
in that old Buick?

276
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,207
You both
slept in it.

277
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,375
How young
were we then, Doc?

278
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,743
Oh, how much?

279
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,912
Where are you gonna come up
with that kind of money?

280
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,213
We're talking seven figures.

281
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,381
Don't worry
about the goddamn money!

282
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,883
Now, I'm in a new business deal.

283
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,818
Yeah, let me guess.
He's gonna raise the Titanic.

284
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,652
Doc, you work for me.

285
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,989
You start writing
songs for me, pronto.

286
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,357
You don't inspire me.
I can't get in the mood.

287
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,693
That contract don't say shit
about mood.

288
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,929
You work for me, Doc,
or you got nothing!

289
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,264
I mean, never mind your
vouchers, your ex-wives,

290
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,000
your invisible
musicians.

291
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,169
I'll stop the $150,000 a year
I pay to keep you in golf balls.

292
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,437
I manage Blackie Buck,

293
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,439
and you can't do shit
about that.

294
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,341
Blackie Buck, yeah...
The way he's living,

295
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,010
his heart's gonna
blow up before Halloween.

296
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,744
You work for me, Doc!

297
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,579
You run Cowbird Music for me.

298
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,781
How could you use
his lawyer

299
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,516
to negotiate
your contract with him?

300
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,518
I mean, you should've known
he'd own you 100%.

301
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,386
Well, that wasn't the deal.
Well, what was the deal?

302
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,556
The deal was I'd put up the
talent, he'd put up the money,

303
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,225
we'd split 50/50.
We shook on it.

304
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,426
You shook hands
on it?

305
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,593
Doc, you didn't
sign his hand,

306
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,062
you signed a contract.

307
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,396
That's real funny.

308
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,132
Doc, you got cheated.

309
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,733
He has an exclusive
on you.

310
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,468
He owns you.

311
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,602
Do I own
this building?

312
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,071
Yeah, you do own
this building,

313
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,405
and the management
contract

314
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,406
with Blackie Buck,
but that's it.

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,042
* A night to remember

316
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,377
RADIO DEEJAY: Blackie Buck
returns to Austin.

317
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,146
What'd he say?

318
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,247
He says we're going
to Austin.

319
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,282
Where are we going?

320
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,618
We're headed

1931
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,867
* To my childhood

1932
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:01,303
I'm making a collection
for Rodeo Rocky.

1933
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,305
Here's my authorization
right here.

1934
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:05,808
Just give me half.
Go on, now. Keep going.

1935
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,042
Come on. Get on the floor.

1936
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,477
Get on the floor.

1937
01:29:11,714 --> 01:29:14,316
Hey, Rocky Shit Detail Man,
what are you listening to?

1938
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,352
I'm listening
to Chopin, asshole.

1939
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,455
Well, listen to that,
asshole.

1940
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:20,556
Too much bass?

1941
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:24,126
Tell Rocky I wrote it
just for him.

1942
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:30,332
* Come, come, come, come

1943
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:36,371
* Come to the church
In the wildwood *

1944
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:43,412
* Oh, come to the church
In the vale *

1945
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:47,249
[GILDA'S SONG CONTINUES]

1946
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:49,485
How much did you get?

1947
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:53,321
I did pretty good.
You got robbed.

1948
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:57,092
There's a lot of that
going on.

1949
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:00,062
How many tickets
did you sell?

1950
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:01,897
Seven thousand
two hundred.

1951
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,732
Building holds five.

1952
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,035
Well, shit, bubba, airlines
do that all the time.

1953
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:09,572
Boss?

1954
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:13,408
What happened to him?

1955
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,511
I don't know.
He just blacked out.

1956
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:18,280
This will make him
feel better:

wrote for him.
