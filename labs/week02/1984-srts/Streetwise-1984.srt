Isn't it after every two weeks
you can get pregnant?

169

After your period, every two weeks?

170
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,340
[woman] You can get pregnant
anytime during your cycle.

171
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,593
A person can even get pregnant
when she's having her period.

172
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,387
It's not as likely.

173
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,682

and didn't use a rubber,

174

-[Tiny] Fourteen.

185

[woman] And how would you feel
about being pregnant?

186
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,343
-I want a baby.
-[woman] You do?

187

But not by no trick, though.

188

[woman] But if you're pregnant right now,

189
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,560
then it would be a pregnancy by a trick.

190
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,690
And what's your feeling
about being pregnant, if you are,

191

192
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,861
Well, I'm not getting an abortion.

193

-[woman] You might?
-No, I won't.

194

[woman] Oh, you would not get an abortion?

195
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,034
I don't believe in it.

196
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,037
[woman] And tell me about that.
Why don't —

197
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,748
What's your feeling about abortion?

198
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,834
Because it's like
you're murdering somebody.

199
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,462
Murd — I can't pronounce the word.

200
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,632
But it's, like, it's a little baby
inside you, and you're just killing it.

201
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,258
And that's not fair to the baby.

202
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,886
I mean, it's not the baby's fault.
You know what I mean?

203
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,013
[woman] So that would not be
a choice for you?

324
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,394
I go, "I gotta get her.
I can't let her do that stuff."

325
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,938
'Cause I always heard bad things
about, like, white slavery,

326
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,231
that she's gonna get beat up.

327
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,818
That's what scared me. So I thought,
"I gotta come down here and get her out,

328
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,486
whether I gotta kidnap her or what."

329
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,738
I come down here, I see her,
she goes, "It's great!"

330
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,074
So I'm just going, "What?
I heard you don't like it here,

331
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,285
that you're getting beat up
and raped and everything."

332
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,079
"No, I'm — I'm making so much money,
and it's so easy.

333
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,415
The money comes so easy.
It's great. You oughta do it."

334
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,126
Then I go, "How much money do you make?"

335
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,044

and I just thought,

336

00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,058
<i>to tell you the truth.</i>

486
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,436
<i>See, I'm my own type of person. I am.</i>

487
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,647
<i>I protect a lot of people.</i>

488
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,900
<i>This bum was trying to feel on
a friend of mine's chest.</i>

489
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:35,029
<i>I literally walked up to him, made him
come back and apologize to the girl.</i>

490
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,490
<i>Because she is not public property.</i>

491
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,909
<i>I could understand if it was
a telephone pole or something.</i>

492
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,327
<i>He could touch it then.</i>

493
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,747
<i>It's just the way I am. I've been
like that since I've been down here.</i>

494
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,791
<i>'Cause nobody did nothing for me.</i>

495
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,379
<i>So I made him come back and apologize
and sent him on his way.</i>

496
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,841
<i>I just told him, "Go on, man,
get out of here." He left.</i>

497
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,015
[man on radio] <i>Which means Washington
weather should improve somewhat tonight.</i>

498
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,143
<i>"Improve" if you don't like the rain,
because the rain's gonna get worse.</i>

499
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,729
<i>Temperatures
will remain moderate statewide…</i>

500
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:13,234
[woman] <i>She has grown up quite a bit
since she is been on these streets.</i>

501
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,945
<i>She's 14 going on 21.</i>

502
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,114
[man on radio] <i>GE's new
high-tech electronic dish washer…</i>

503
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,324
Extra pickles too, Mom, please.

504
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,118
[Tiny's mother] Put extra pickle on that.

505
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,204
[Tiny's mother] <i>Oh, when l was drinking,</i>

506
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:28,040
<i>Erin and I used to get
in some bad arguments.</i>

507
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,794
<i>See, I could see it in her mind,
she's thinking, "Oh, no, not again."</i>

508
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,881
You know I don't like mustard or ketchup.
It's gross.

509
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,466
Mmm! Thank you, Mom.

510
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,594
[Tiny's mother]
<i>I don't know why I started drinking.</i>

511
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,889
<i>I think just 'cause of boredom
half the time.</i>

512
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,932
<i>I don't know.</i>

513
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,686
Too much juice! [laughs]

514
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,985
-Come on. Two more bites.
-One more.

515
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,237
-Uh-uh.
-I don't like the bread.

516
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,657
[radio announcer continues talking]

517
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,451
[Tiny's mother]
<i>See, I've had Erin all my life.</i>

518
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:06,579
<i>I've had to bring her up myself and then —</i>

519
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,415
<i>and then one day, I suddenly get married.</i>

520
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,963
<i>And I think she likes Tom, but she just
doesn't want to admit it.</i> [laughs]

521
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,216
Feel like I'm pregnant.

522
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,385
[yawns] Oh, goodness.

523
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,225
-Don't you have no whipping cream?
-No.

524
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,440
My fear is that someday I'm going to get
a phone call or a knock on my door

525
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,736
<i>and it's — she is not gonna
be there anymore.</i>

526
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:49,163
-[in high-pitched voice] Hi, babies! Hi!
-[dogs yipping]

527
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,583
[Tiny] <i>We started living at Larry's
a couple months ago</i>

528
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:57,171
<i>because my mom and my dad
had got kicked out of their apartment,</i>

529
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,632
<i>and Larry offered them a place to stay.</i>

530
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,468
-Ow. Shit.
-Erin.

531
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:07,473
[Tiny] <i>Naturally, you call somebody
who marries your mother a dad.</i>

532
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,809
-Don't fall.
-I won't.

533
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,020
-[dog barking]
-[Tiny] <i>Sometimes he's an asshole.</i>

534
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,190
<i>-But he's in the treatment center.</i>
-[Tiny, high-pitched voice] Puppas!

535
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,986
<i>He's gotta stay there for two months.</i>

536
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,363
[Tiny's mother] Oh, for crying out loud.

537
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,282
-Damn dog.
-[dog whines]

538
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:28,744
Quit pissing on the floor now.
Look at this mess.

539
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,831
Open the other door.

540
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,167
[Tiny's mother]
Oh, for crying out... Damn that dog.

541
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,461
[dog whining]

542
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,090
Should've left her out.

543
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,928
What happened to this house? I cleaned it.

544
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,974
Oh. I'm gonna spray
some deodorant around here.

545
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,392
My book.

546
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,769
Spray some Right Guard.

547
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,855
[Tiny's mother laughs] Right Guard.

548
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,984
Well, you wanted the dog, Erin.
I didn't want her.

549
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,073
[sighs]

550
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,661
I need more makeup, Mom.

551
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,414
[Tiny's mother] Well...

552
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,668
-I wanted Cloudy Blue.
-Yeah.

553
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,587
Then I wanted Meadow Violets.

554
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,338
-Yeah.
-Then Cl — Uh...

555
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:25,092
[Tiny's mother] <i>She's always wanting this
and wanting that.</i>

556
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:28,054
<i>Now, when you're a waitress,
you just don't make that much.</i>

557
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:33,059
I want these three frosts — Blue Flame,
Flash of Blue, and Country Lavender.

558
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:37,146
[Tiny's mother] <i>One day she come home,
told me she's made $200.</i>

559
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,315
<i>I about fell off my chair.</i>

560
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,400
And here, I wanted The Best of Bronze.

561
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,611
That costs too much.
Look at the price on that.

562
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,655
-Two for $4.99.
-Oh, two. Oh.

563
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,365
<i>When Erin first told me about this,</i>

564
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,869
<i>she thought I would be really angry
with her and hate her, but I don't.</i>

565
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,954
You gonna need some money for the weekend?

566
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,372
[Tiny] Yeah.

567
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:59,043
[Tiny's mother] <i>It's just a phase
she is going through right now.</i>

568
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,630
<i>I can't stop her from doing this
'cause she's just gonna do it anyways.</i>

569
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,132
How much money can I get? [sniffs]

570
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,218
-[Tiny's mother] Why?
-Just wondering.

571
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,678
[Tiny's mother]
So you can spend it foolishly?

572
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,847
Whatever. [sighs]

573
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,850
-Can I get 20?
-[Tiny's mother] No.

574
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:18,187
-[Tiny] Ten? Fifteen.
-No.

575
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,106
-Ten?
-Maybe.

576
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,775
You're gonna be gone the whole weekend.

577
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,319
-No.
-[Tiny] I'm not gonna spend it on no dope.

578
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:29,657
[Tiny's mother] <i>She's very bullheaded.
She kinda resented me getting married.</i>

579
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,744
<i>She and Tom, just —
He tries to correct her.</i>

580
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,246
-[sighs]
-[Tiny's mother] What?

581
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,498
I was gonna say, you think
I'd be getting that makeup

582
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,376
by the end of this month or next month?

583
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,046
Uh, probably about the 17th.

584
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,882
-[Tiny] The 17th?
-Of October, yeah.

585
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,885
Isn't that the day you got married?

586
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,596
Oh, yeah! How about that?

587
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:54,640
[scoffs]

588
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,642
[Tiny] <i>He beats up on my mom.</i>

589
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,686
<i>He broke her leg before.</i>

590
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,313
I betcha Dad's gonna
start bitching at you, probably.

591
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,399
No. About what?

592
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,194
Probably wondering
if you was sleeping with Larry or not.

593
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,238
Oh, Erin!

594
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,658
-l'm not saying you did.
-For heaven's sakes.

595
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,286
But that's what he's gonna
start bitching at you about.

596
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,537
[Tiny] <i>He doesn't work.</i>

597
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,456
<i>He depends on my mom a lot,
which is not right.</i>

598
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,834
<i>I think a man should support the woman.</i>

599
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,253
<i>He says, "She doesn't have the money"
and all this other shit.</i>

600
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,338
<i>And I say, "It's because of you.</i>

601
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:30,718
<i>Because you spend her money on beer,
and she doesn't have time for me."</i>

602
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,014
<i>Now my mom's in a mess
she can't get out of</i>

603
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,183
<i>I feel really sorry for her.</i>

604
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,269
[Tiny] Be a year.

605
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,730
Year has gone by fast, huh?

606
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,691
Huh?

607
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,110
Mom?

608
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,112
-[Tiny's mother] Yes.
-[glass sets on table]

609
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,031
-Don't bug me...
-[Tiny murmurs]

610
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,532
...when I'm drinking.

611
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,694
[Rat] <i>When I first ran away
and came here to Seattle,</i>

612
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:35,074
<i>l was tired of being the middle man
between my mom and my dad is divorce.</i>

613
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:40,537
<i>I told my mom when I called her
about two weeks after I got here,</i>

614
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,540
<i>you know, I was in trouble with the law,</i>

615
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,501
<i>and she understood it, you know.</i>

616
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,837
<i>She said, "All right,
I'll see you when you're 18."</i>

617
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,923
<i>And I said, "All right."</i>

618
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,094
<i>And then about a month later
I called her again and I said,</i>

619
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,263
<i>"Hey, Mom, how's it going?"</i>

620
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,057
<i>And she said, "Oh, it's awful. l'm broke.</i>

621
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,770
<i>He is trying to drain me,
flying to make my life miserable."</i>

622
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,193
<i>And she stated crying a lot
and asking me to come home,</i>

623
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,570
<i>and I just said, "Mom, I gotta go,"
and I hung up on her.</i>

624
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,782
Sir, you wouldn't have a dime, would you?
I need to finish my laundry.

625
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,536
<i>And then l never called her again.
l never wrote her a letter or nothing.</i>

626
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,746
I need to finish my laundry.
I need one more dime.

627
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,873
-Here you go, son.
-Thanks a lot.

628
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,583
Have a good day.

629
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,627
<i>Fuck it, you know.</i>

630
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:32,798
<i>Let her think what she wants —
I'm dead, whatever she wants to think.</i>

631
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,259
<i>But I don't want to listen to her cry.</i>

632
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,178
<i>Making me feel bad.</i>

633
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,311
That building at 1420 Second Avenue,

634
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,855
by the grace of God,
will be the new shelter

635
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:52,943
that will sleep 200 men and 15 women
and two families.

636
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:56,989
And all we ask from you is one dollar.

637
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,908
We don't ask
for tens, twenties, and hundreds.

638
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:03,579
But you let God move on you
and you give one dollar,

639
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,456
and God will bless you.

640
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,126
For 14 years,
I believed that God was dead!

641
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,129
But I do not believe that anymore.

642
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,382
Billy Graham convicted me
when he pointed his finger right at me

643
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:19,219
and said, "God wants you to serve him!"

644
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,347
When you leave here, what you gonna do?
You gonna go home.

645
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,806
-Right, brother?
-Sure am.

646
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,601
Yeah, you're gonna go home,
and you're gonna go into your big house,

647
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,019
and get in your big bed,

648
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,938
and sleep with your big wife,
and all that there, brother.

649
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:34,526
I'm gonna go to my house and I'm gonna
pack food for tomorrow's food bank.

650
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,695
-Okay, what religion are you?
-l'm Pentecostal.

651
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:37,905
-You're Pentecostal?
-Full Gospel.

652
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,823
That's what I was raised as,
a Pentecostal.

653
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,492
But I don't believe that shit.

654
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,286
You want to know how they're working us?
This is how they working us.

655
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,206
Remember once a year in school
when they'd tell you,

656
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,208
"Bring your canned goods
and give 'em to us?"

657
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,542
That's what they're doing.

658
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,795
They say, "Bring your canned goods
and give 'em to us."

659
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,755
Then they turn around
and give 'em back to you.

660
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,632
-[laughter]
-Then they say, "We're doin' somethin'.

661
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,802
We're doing something for y'all.
Give us some money."

662
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,428
That's how they working us, man.

663
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:05,474
I could stand here and say, "Yes, Lord.
Thank you, Jesus. Give me a dollar."

664
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,352
-You know? I can do that.
-Well, you could.

665
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,729
Yeah, right, I could,
and probably get a dollar.

666
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:14,066
-It's your privilege.
-But see, man, all this is nothing.

667
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,527
But I'm not standing here for me.
You would be standing there for you.

668
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,154
-Who you standing here for?
-l'm standing there for you.

669
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,115
-You standing here for me?
-[preacher] That's right.

670
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,033
-Ain't that nothin'!
-'Cause you might be hungry this winter.

671
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,911
You ain't gave me a dime.
We're wise out here, man. Streetwise.

672
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,374
Because the whole situation is,
everybody scamming. You're scamming.

673
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,961
You and I gonna have to talk about this.
Maybe you can wise me up a little bit.

674
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,339
-Yeah, 'cause you need a lot of wising...
-[laughter]

675
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,925
...if you think you're going to get rich
standing out here.

676
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,386
What gives you the audacity to think

677
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,973
that we gonna come off our street life
into your program, right?

678
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,476
-I don't want you in my program.
-Ah, just a second ago you said —

679
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,357
All I want to do is just bring you in
and give you a good night's sleep.

680
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,610
[Patrice] I can wake up in the morning,
go downstairs, eat some Cap'n Crunch?

681
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,655
-Cookies and coffee, whatever we got.
-And I can leave and come back again?

682
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,866
-Then you can leave again.
-Can I bring my girlfriend?

683
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,368
No. If you do, she'll have to stay
in a different place.

684
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:09,121
-No, brother. It don't work like that.
-Yeah, it works that way.

685
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,206
-No, but I like you, brother.
-I like you too.

686
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,749
-What's your name?
-Tom Robinson.

687
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,169
Let me have a card. Can I have a card?

688
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:21,425
[both] <i>♪ My mama done told me
You better shop around ♪</i>

689
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,427
[Jack] <i>♪ My mama told me ♪</i>

690
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,180
[Rat] <i>There's many different scams.
There's eat and run.</i>

691
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,975
<i>That's where you go into a restaurant.
You know, you order something.</i>

692
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,979
<i>Usually, they'll set you right
by the cash register if you look young</i>

693
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,274
<i>and like you don't have no money
so they can see you.</i>

694
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,235
<i>But right by the cash register
is right by the door,</i>

695
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,446
<i>so that works out even better.</i>

696
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,782
<i>There's also dumpster diving.</i>

697
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,452
<i>You call Shakey's Pizza.</i>

698
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,580
<i>You can do it right out in front
of the restaurant at a pay phone.</i>

699
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,790
<i>They got a pay phone out front.</i>

700
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:57,127
<i>You call 'em up, you order
these Hawaiian-style pizzas</i>

701
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:58,795
<i>with Canadian bacon, you know.</i>

702
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:03,509
Yes, I'd like a large pepperoni pizza
with pineapple on it.

703
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:07,346
<i>They ask your name and your number
and you give it to 'em.</i>

704
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,974
Uh, regular crust. Richard.

705
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,480
345-9762.

706
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,858
Yes, it is.

707
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,028
All righty. Bye-bye.

708
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,989
<i>You hang up,
they call you right back, you know.</i>

709
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,325
<i>You say, "Yeah, I ordered
this, this, and this,"</i>

710
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,661
<i>they say "All right," and you hang up.</i>

711
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,788
[phone rings]

712
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,332
Yes, this is Richard.

713
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,835
Yes, I did.

714
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:45,384
Uh, thin crust
with, uh, pepperoni and pineapple.

715
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,010
All righty. Bye-bye.

716
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,351
<i>And then about an hour, you know,
nobody comes to claim the pizzas,</i>

717
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,979
<i>and they set 'em out
in the dumpster in the boxes.</i>

718
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:02,234
<i>And you go over there, you know,
you got six or seven free pizzas.</i>

719
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,865
<i>It's easy to survive without pulling
tricks or dates on the streets.</i>

720
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:13,078
[chattering]

721
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,415
You get two hits out of every pack, man.
Five dollars a hit.

722
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,209
[laughter]

723
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:23,589
I sell it all the time, man.
It sells like pancakes. Hell yeah.

724
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,799
Me and Junior made
over a hundred and something bucks

725
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,136
selling nothing but bunk at a concert.

726
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,598
Then we went and bought some good cocaine
and... [imitates explosion]

727
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,016
[laughs]

728
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,226
[man] Oh, you guys be trippin', man!

729
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,937
[Rat] <i>You never really
see James around that much.</i>

730
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:43,317
<i>He's always off gone somewhere, you know.</i>

731
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,528
<i>No tellin' what he's doing.
I doubt if he's turning tricks, though.</i>

732
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:53,827
The first one you do, the last two we do.
But you make sure that we do them, okay?

733
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,413
It's your responsibility to make sure
you walk out of here alive.

734
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,706
All right.

735
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,751
Okay, hold a fist for me.

736
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,422
There we go.

737
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,508
[speakers: pop music playing]

738
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,849
[Rat] <i>You gotta be over 18 to sell blood,</i>

739
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,977
<i>so the kids on the streets can't sell it,</i>

740
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,855
<i>so they can't make money that way.</i>

741
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,233
<i>But if you get a fake ID and you look 18,</i>

742
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,861
<i>you can go there and sell blood.</i>

743
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:33,533
I asked Steve.
He gives me big old leftovers like this.

744
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,952
-Big plateful that's this high and shit.
-Ugh! Leftovers.

745
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,413
I could give you a big old foot
full of something right now.

746
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:42,542
No, leftovers from the same night.
You know, like lasagna and shit.

747
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:46,338
49th and Kenyon.
He was telling me that your friends —

748
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,924
No, my friends.
I said, "Remember that address for me."

749
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,427
-Oh, okay.
-[Rat] Hey, back off, Jackson. I gotta —

750
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:53,845
[Tiny] Donna!

751
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,307
-Back off.
-Give me your money, boy.

752
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,310
-Give me my money.
-[Rat] Give you your money?

753
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,271
[Dewayne] Yeah, give me — It's gonna be
my money when I take it from you.

754
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,108
-[Tiny] Donna!
-[Rat] How much money you think I took?

755
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,235
[Dewayne] Whatever you got
in your pocket's mine.

756
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,112
[Rat] Uh, let me see.

757
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,073
[Dewayne] Crap!

758
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,492
-[Rat] What was that?
-[Dewayne] We just playing.

759
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,120
If you're a goddamn woman,
why don't you act like one?

760
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,039
-Fuck you. Fuck you.
-Don't you know how?

761
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,542
-Don't you know how to act like a woman?
-I am a woman! Yeah!

762
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,626
Well, then act like one!

763
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,170
I don't have to act like
all these bitches down here, hell no!

764
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,549
I'm not talking about acting like a bitch!
Talking about acting like a woman, Lulu!

765
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,509
-You don't do that!
-Fuck you! You ain't my man!

766
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,593
You don't tell me shit!

767
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,721
I wouldn't be your man
even if you liked men!

768
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:39,057
You can't tell me shit!
You can't tell me nothing!

769
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,851
Bitch, I'm telling you
all kinds of things!

770
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,185
Fuck you, punk!

771
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:43,937
Yeah, punk!

772
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,021
-Bitch!
-Punk!

773
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,106
-Ho!
-Punk!

774
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,649
-Tramp!
-Get your KC,

[Lulu]
<i>I ain't putting on a dress for nobody.</i>

777
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,449
<i>I haven't done it since I was 16.</i>

778
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,494
<i>I've had my nose broke five times.</i>

[Lulu chattering, faint]

780
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:04,541
<i>And I've had both sets of my eye bones
on top and bottom broke.</i>

781
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,418
[Lulu] Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!

782
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,420
<i>I've had my jaw cracked three times.</i>

783
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,922
He ain't got nothin' on me!
What the fuck is it to you?

784
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,091
<i>I'll tell people
they can beat the shit out of me,</i>

785
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,427
<i>but they're not getting me
away from down here.</i>

786
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,183
Calvin and Erica been down here?

787
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,726
Erica was, yeah.

788
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,229
'Cause I hear — This girl told me
that they're after my ass.

789
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,856
So I gotta keep it cool.

790
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,276
Man, I wouldn't even worry about 'em.

791
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:36,615
A lot of people after my ass 'cause
I'm not working anymore, so I don't know.

792
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,367
Well, be with me
and you wouldn't have to work.

793
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,578
-[laughs] No.
-I'm serious.

794
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,413
No. [laughs]

795
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,749
No motherfucker's gonna fuck with you.

796
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,002
No, I'm just not gonna
come down here anymore.

797
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,130
-I just felt coming down here today.
-Let me get your phone number then,

798
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:54,591
so I can call you, so we can
go out for pizza or something.

799
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,009
I don't have a phone right now.

800
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,553
Well, let me give you my number
and you call me.

801
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,765
-Okay, whatever.
-Anybody got a pen?

802
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,434
Don't got no pen. Anybody got a pen?

803
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:07,479
-Say, anybody got a pen?
-[singing, faint]

804
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,314
Nobody got a pen.

805
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:11,817
Fuck.

806
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,195
There's a pen. Thank you, sir.
Anybody got a piece of paper now?

807
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:25,288
Whoa!

808
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,584
[man] <i>Well, you gained
about three inches in height</i>

809
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,963
since we saw you
almost a year and a half ago.

810
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,924
You haven't gained much weight.
You're about the same weight as you were.

811
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,344
I eat all the time,
but I don't gain no weight or nothing.

812
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,346
Think there's a worm
inside me or something.

813
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,473
-You think you got worms, huh?
-I don't know.

814
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,559
-I want to get it checked out.
-Sure.

815
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,769
Can you sort of straighten up?

816
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,604
<i>Do you spend a lot of time on the streets?</i>

817
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,689
[Dewayne] <i>Yup.</i>

818
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,775
-What do you do down there?
-Panhandle. Just hang around.

819
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,945
-Hug all the girls and stuff.
-Mmm.

820
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,447
-You got a lot of girlfriends?
-Yup.

821
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,532
Mmm.

822
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,118
Let's see those tonsils
and see how they look now.

823
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,121
-Ah!
-That's good. That's good. Take it easy.

824
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,249
When did you have tonsillitis last?

825
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,960
Um, let's see.

826
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,922
When I was locked up in Echo Glen.
That was maybe two months ago.

827
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,591
-Did you go to school last year?
-Nope.

828
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,301
For two years, I haven't been to school.

829
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,803
So you haven't been to school
since you were 12, huh?

830
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:23,430
No. I'm 16.

831
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,848
-You're 16 now?
-Yep.

832
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,560
-Does it hurt when I do this?
-Nope. It feels good.

833
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,686
Feels good, huh?

834
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,438
<i>What do you think
you'd like to do someday?</i>

835
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,315
I don't know.

836
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,067
-Anything interest you at all?
-Nope.

837
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,737
You got lots of big glands in your neck.

838
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,281
You got chronically infected tonsils,

839
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:45,744
which certainly don't help
your growth and your nutrition any.

840
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,455
I might join the navy
if the world lasts that long.

841
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:51,374
Reagan's sending all them marines
shooting everybody.

842
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:54,294
All them marines gettin' shootin',
cuttin' out Russia,

843
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,504
and Russia's probably gonna
bomb us or something.

844
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,173
-Yeah, right there.
-That hurts, huh?

845
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,383
-Yeah.
-That hurt bad or just a little?

846
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,968
-Just a little.
-Just a little, huh?

847
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:04,596
Oh! Right there hurts. Oh, yeah.

848
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:08,642
Yeah, I had a blade like that
until I got busted.

849
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:11,019
It was that black one right there.

850
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,439
You ain't got 50 cents?

851
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:17,108
Not today. I got a job.

852
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,486
-You want a job?
-Nah.

853
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:24,824
Why don't you just walk up to some guy
and ask him for 50 cents to catch the bus?

854
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:28,036
-'Cause I ain't got a face like yours.
-Oh, it'll work.

855
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,083
He's the worst one on Pike Street.
He's the worst one out of them all.

856
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,251
He'll be your buddy
when you're face to face,

857
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:38,254
but as soon as you turn around,
you got a knife in your back.

858
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:39,673
It ain't worth it.

<i>I know how to fight,
but I like disappearing.</i>

861
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,605
<i>My mother and father got a divorce
when l was about a year old.</i>

862
00:46:55,689 --> 00:47:00,568
<i>My mother decided
I should go to a foster home.</i>

863
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:04,322
<i>About five years ago, my father says,
"I want you to come over."</i>

864
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:07,242
<i>So, I spent six months with my father.</i>

865
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,954
<i>Six months were up,
nobody could find my mother.</i>

866
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,707
<i>A year went up,

867
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,918
<i>My father got tired of me and my sister.</i>

868
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,878
<i>He told me to leave.</i>

869
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:20,505
<i>I left.</i>

870

871

Hi. How ya doing?

872
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:33,852
Nothin'. Just called

You don't even know.

875
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,944
No, call me a prostitute.
Come on, I dare you to.

876
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,571
No, that's not what I'm doing,

877
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,115
but that's what you called me
last time I was gone.

878
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,992
Yes, you did.

879
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,038
I called to tell you I'm okay,
to see how you were doing,

880
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,749
and now I'm gonna hang up saying I'm okay.

881
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,837
And I hope you have fun
with your stupid-ass husband. Bye.

882
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,548
Ooh, she pisses me off. [chuckles]

886
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:20,607

00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,180
[Shellie] One thing I don't do
is fall in love in two or three days.

-I've made many mistakes.
-You've never lived on the streets.

895

I have so lived on the streets before.

896

Not like this. Not like I have.

897
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:05,068
I don't want to live
on the streets like you have.

898
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,070
I'm not going to either, man.

899
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,072
Are you gonna help me dye my hair?

900
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:12,367
-Hell no. I can't dye hair, man.
-I'Il do it myself then.

901
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,452
I'll do it myself then.

902
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,705
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,
but I'm gonna do it myself then.

903
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,000
Why do you want your hair dyed?

904
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,669
To change?

905
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:27,674
Not actually to change.
To get away from everything.

906
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,802
That ain't gonna get you away
from jack shit, honey.

907
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,304
It will, considering
I'm gonna dye my hair.

912
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:50,738
[sighs] I'm trying to get
some input from you, Shellie,

913

920

I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me.

922

until you started asking me!

923

-But you wouldn't tell me then.
-[Shellie] I told you that he did.

924
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:27,525
When you asked me
if he did a certain thing, I said, "Yeah."

925
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:30,862
And then when you went and told him,
ever since then he's hated me.

926
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,489
Yeah, but he didn't do it anymore.

He thinks he's doin' it.

1124
01:01:18,968 --> 01:01:21,762
-That's why he's getting knocked around.
-You think you're doin' it?

1125
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,932
I love you, Patrice.
You wanna go eat something?

1126
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,477
I'm not gonna just give you my money now.

1127
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:30,396
If you wanna go eat something,
I'll feed you.

1128
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,939
-I'm not hungry, Ma.
-Yes, you are.

1129
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,607
What did you eat today?

1130
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:38,195
Um... some cookies and, um...

1131
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,740
-Junk food?
-And some juice.

1132
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,869
You want something hot in your stomach.
That's what you need.

1133
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:48,247
Well, if I give you some of my money,
what you gonna do with it?

1134
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,707
Save it.

1135
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,793
-Oh, yeah. How you gonna save it out here?
-[all chuckling]

1136
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:56,338
You'll just tell me anything
just to shut me up, huh?

1137
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:58,424
I'm tellin' you. He gonna save it.

1138
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:01,594
-You got some money, Mama?
-Mmm, a little change.

1139
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,637
If I think you're buying
a pack of cigarettes,

1140
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:06,140
next time I see you
I won't give you a dollar.

1141
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,766
-Okay.
-[woman] Or some weed.

1142
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:10,436
-Yeah, you better not.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

1143
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,023
You know, that's hard-work money.
I worked for that money.

1144
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,276
-You spend it wisely. Okay?
-Okay.

1145
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,570
And when you get straight,
you know where your house is.

1146
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,030
-Okay.
-Okay.

1147
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:22,907
And the only way
you can really get straight,

1148
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:26,368
you have to stay in touch with Mom,
because you can't straighten yourself.

1149
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,457
[Lulu] <i>I have seven brothers and sisters.</i>

1150
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:36,879
<i>I lost one seven months ago
from, uh, cirrhosis of the liver.</i>

1151
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,256
<i>She was 26.</i>

1152
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,467
<i>l loved her a lot.</i>

1153
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:46,597
<i>It made me sort of loony
for about a month, month and a half</i>

1154
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,641
<i>People thought I was going crazy.</i>

1155
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:51,352
<i>l wasn't going crazy.
I just couldn't handle it.</i>

1156
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,229
[Lulu, onlookers shouting]

1157
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:00,986
[shouting continues]

1158
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,237
Fuck that!

1159
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,531
[Lulu] I just got out of jail
not even a month ago.

1160
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:07,409
I ain't getting in no trouble, punk!

1161
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:10,204
I bet you, guaranteed,
I got a bruise on my arm,

1162
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,331
and I'm pressing charges on your ass.

1163
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,707
Punk!

1164
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,503
'Cause I hate you
and I'm gonna get you for that.

1165
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:23,842
-Hey, you want him?
-[Lulu] I'm not a him. I'm a her.

1166
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,844
-Can you please calm down?
-I'm pressing charges.

1167
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,013
-I want you to know that.
-Fine, you do that.

1168
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:30,808
-Are you a sergeant?
-I'm asking you to please calm down.

1169
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:31,892
I'm calm.

1170
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,728
Now will you please leave?
Because we have quite a crowd here.

1171
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,356
[Lulu] You're a punk!

1172
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,024
Punk!

1173
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:41,944
[Lulu continues shouting]

1174
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,655
I don't give a fuck! [continues shouting]

1175
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,740
[needle whirring]

1176
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,754
[Shadow] <i>Giving blood, there's pain.</i>

1177
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:07,511
<i>Falling in love, there's pain.</i>

1178
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:15,352
<i>All you feel is the first initial needle.</i>

1179
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:22,317
<i>The rest is lingering pain
from when the needle is pulled out.</i>

1180
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,368
That burns.

1181
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:34,955
-[man] That's the worst part of it.
-Yeah, I know.

1182
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:43,422
-Well, how do you like it?
-That's nice.

1183
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,223
Honey...

1184
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,478
come and help me figure this out.

1185
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,188
Now hold this.

1186
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,651
-Right here.
-[Munchkin] What, there?

1187
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:07,071
-Right there.
-[Patti scoffs]

1188
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,324
-[laughs]
-Bring your head back up here.

1189
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,703
Shit burns your eyes, I'm telling you.

1190
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:16,497
You're not supposed
to have your eyes open.

1191
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,167
-Yeah, you poked me in my eye now.
-Stop being a jerk.

1192
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,587
Thanks. You just wiped it
right across my fucking eye.

1193
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,506
God, man.

1194
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,425
Why don't you do
your own fucking perm, then?

1195
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:36,141
[man] <i>I probably have
about a hundred kids on my caseload</i>

1196
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:38,227
<i>Of course, Patti is Patti.</i>

1197
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,937
<i>She's an individualist,</i>

1198
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,481
<i>and she'll go along with you
if you're doing what she wants,</i>

1199
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:46,568
<i>but she isn't gonna do a damn thing
that she doesn't want to do.</i>

1200
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:49,446
I knocked on the door,
and I was just worried about you.

1201
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,698
I don't care how worried
you're getting about me.

1202
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:54,993
All I gotta say is, you don't got
no right walking into my house.

1203
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:58,914
But this morning, we've got the —
You know, we've got job therapy.

1204
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,416
We know that,
but, Jerry, you gotta understand

1205
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,293
that you can't just be
walking into my house.

1206
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,295
You might get shot, as far as you know.

1207
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:09,591
I took the chance you wouldn't shoot me.
And then I did, I banged on the door—

1208
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,677
Well, the next time,
you're getting shot, okay?

1209
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,761
Okay.

1210
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:15,389
So that means the rent's due today, right?

1211
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,476
-No.
-And if you're gonna stay here —

1212
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,271
-Not from what Bob says.
-It is.

1213
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:24,982
I give Bob $20 and I told him
I'd give him the rest Friday.

1214
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:28,610
This is the deal. If you're gonna stay
here, you've gotta go out to job therapy.

1215
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,404
[Patti] You can't tell me what to do.

1216
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,781
We've been together,
working together on this.

1217
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,033
-Me and you ain't been together.
-We have.

1218
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:39,371
We've been working together, Patti.
And I'm concerned about you, you know.

1219
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,291
I don't want you guys
to have to hit the bricks again.

1220
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:44,793
I don't want you to have
to get back into some crap

1221
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,421
that you shouldn't be involved in
to pay your rent.

1222
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:51,675
You've got a chance
to make it a good way, okay?

1223
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:55,554
Now, this guy has got some ideas
that can help you get a job.

1224
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:56,972
That's a better life for you

1225
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:00,058
than having to be hustling on the streets
or be down there pushing —

1226
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:03,562
-Who says we're hustling on the streets?
-How else you gonna make your money?

1227
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:10,485
[Rat] <i>Most of the kids on the streets,
that's how they survive.</i>

1228
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:14,239
<i>They feel like if they don't do the dates,</i>

1229
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:17,534
<i>that they're gonna be broke,
they're gonna have to dumpster dive,</i>

1230
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:19,328
<i>they're gonna have to beg for money,</i>

1231
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,998
<i>and that's gonna make them feel,
because they're girls,</i>

1232
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,875
<i>like, "Oh, I'm no good.</i>

1233
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,502
<i>l'm dirty, l'm rotten, I'm a scum.</i>

1234
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:30,088
<i>I'm living in this rathole, you know.</i>

1235
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:33,383
<i>No water, no electricity no nothing.</i>

1236
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,385
<i>I'm begging for money."</i>

1237
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:39,181
<i>I guess they feel
that's worse than pulling dates.</i>

1238
01:07:39,932 --> 01:07:42,559
<i>I don't know what their problem is.</i>

1239
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:54,404
Munchkin's the one that wants us out there
ho-ing and shit. I don't want to do it.

1240
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:57,699
The only reason why I'm out there
is because, like I said, Patti —

1241
01:07:57,783 --> 01:08:00,369
Patti's out there
and she has to have somebody with her.

1242
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,663
-But you wanna make him go to you —
-Hi.

1243
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,872
[man] How you doing?

1244
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:05,666
-[Shellie] I'm okay, how are you?
-Oh, hi.

1245
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,626
And when I moved in with them, I said,

1246
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,795
"Patti, I don't wanna be
ho-ing or anything."

1247
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:14,049
She said, "You won't be.
Munchkin's not gonna pimp you or nothing."

1248
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,510
[Tiny] <i>Do you turn dates now?</i>

1249
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,804
[Shellie] <i>Hell yeah. With her.
Me and Patti do.</i>

1250
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,139
<i>I try to tell Patti I don't want to,</i>

1251
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,393
<i>and she'll start bitching at me,
saying that I just missed a $100 date.</i>

1252
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:27,521
<i>Every time I fuck up,
she says it was a $100 date.</i>

1253
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,107
[Tiny] When you do make money,
do you give it to Munchkin?

1254
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,734
-I give it to Patti.
-[Tiny] All of it?

1255
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:34,194
And Patti gives it to Munchkin.

1256
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:36,238
[Tiny] And you haven't
got nothing out of it, huh?

1257
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,531
Uh-uh.

1258
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,034
<i>Me and Patti are both mad fight now,
because Munchkin's sending us out here.</i>

1259
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:44,746
<i>He is sending both of us out here
to fucking get him a suit.</i>

1260
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,708
<i>All he wants is
a whole bunch of clothes and shit.</i>

1261
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,669
Get this. Patti hasn't pulled
any dates today at all.

1262
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,421
-[Tiny] And you have?
-I did two.

1263
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:54,631
Forty bucks each.

1264
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,800
[Shellie] No, you don't know
what I'm doing, man.

1265
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,636
-I don't like the shit that you think.
-Neither do I.

1266
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,096
[Shellie] Doesn't make me happy.

1267
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,308
That's why I walked by
without even talking to you.

1268
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,893
For the simple reason that that's
what I thought you were doing.

1269
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:10,272
[Shellie] But I ain't.
I don't do that kind of shit. I told you.

1270
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,442
-Then what you doing just sittin' there?
-[Shellie] I'm talking!

1271
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:17,446
All he does is fuckin' shoot
the shit up his damn arm, man.

1272
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:20,240
Well, I told her, I said,
"Hey, I can't handle this.

1273
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:22,242
I'm gonna take off and shit."

1274
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,828
Last night, she says,
"You ain't going nowhere."

1275
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,705
And I said, "Yes, I am."

1276
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,750
<i>This morning she was
talking all this shit about</i>

1277
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:33,545
<i>now she was gonna sock me
if I even tried to go up there and stuff</i>

1278
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,298
I mean, I was just tripping out.

1279
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:40,344
How the hell can these people
just think they own me and shit?

1280
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:41,428
Nobody does.

1281
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,056
You end up with the wrong people
down here, it's just —

1282
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,558
You wanna know who set me up
with the wrong people?

1283
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,311
-Who?
-A person by the name of Shadow.

1284
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,479
Huh.

1285
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,439
[both laugh]

1286
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,566
You changed too.

1287
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,818
When I first ran into you,
you were real sweet.

1288
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:59,321
-I still am. I still am.
-Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

1289
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,115
When you ended up at George's,
you were a real pain in the ass.

1290
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,533
Now you're even worse.

1291
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:06,495
I was a real pain in the ass
because you fucking bullshitted me.

1292
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:10,040
-You don't bullshit with me!
-But I keep wanting to. I don't know why.

1293
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,834
-Probably because I like you.
-[laughs]

1294
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:15,337
-Drop that cigarette.
-It's not done.

1295
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,466
Now it's done.

1296

01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,867
<i>She's a sweet girl.</i>

1304
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:48,829
You're a surprise.

1305
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:51,039
Wanna go swimming?

1306
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:54,376
[laughs] You think I'm crazy or something?

1307
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,337
Right. Let's just jump in.

1308
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,505
All right.

1309
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,524
How about a back ﬂip?

1310
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,825
[Tiny] T<i>he reason why I think Rat is cute,</i>

1311
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:31,288
<i>and the reason why I love him so much,
is because he's got pretty eyes.</i>

1312
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,708
<i>I think they're brown or blue.
One or the other.</i>

[dog barking]

1314
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:54,769
[Rat] I gotta go back to school someday.

1315
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:59,316
'Cause I need a diploma
so I can get into the air force.

1316
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:03,653
But right now,
the open road, USA, is for me.

1317
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,156
[laughs] Check you out.

1318
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:10,076
[Rat] <i>I didn't talk to her much
about her being a prostitute.</i>

1319
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,538
<i>She hadn't done it that often
from what she told me.</i>

-[dog yelps]
-[chuckling]

1321
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:19,628
Now where's my kiss, honey-bunch?

1322
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,421
[Tiny] Not with braces.

1323
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:27,219
[chattering]

1324
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,599
Okay, Dewayne, right in here.

1325
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,434
There we go.

1326
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,274
I'm the smallest guy in the unit.

1327
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:44,569
Are you? Yeah, for a while I thought
maybe you'd be in the other unit.

1328
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:46,571
Junior boys? Nah, 'cause of my age.

1329
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:50,200
-So when will I be released?
-Okay, now here's the deal.

1330
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:55,288
Um, I got a phone call
from Kim yesterday, and I wasn't in.

1331
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,082
Then I phoned Kim this morning

1332
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,751
'cause I need to talk to her
before you get out of here.

1333
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,837
They won't tell us nothing
unless we are his parents

1334
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:07,342
or got a piece of paper that says
I'm his legal guardian, and I'm not.

1335
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,594
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I am not his legal guardian.

1336
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:11,346
No, I don't understand.

1337
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,390
I'm temporary guardian.

1338
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:15,809
No — Fuck that pig.

1339
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,104
So all I can do is just keep trying.

1340
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,856
And as soon as I get ahold of her,

1341
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,110
I've given permission for her
to come down and get you.

1342
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:28,405
The court worker signed the papers
so she can get you out of here.

1343
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:30,824
What do you want me to do? I'll do it!

1344
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:34,786
I'll go down there and waste some time
and not find out where the fuck he's at.

1345
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,871
[man] Just shut up, man.

1346
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:40,542
[Jerry] <i>Kim, with that new baby,
she doesn't need any of these problems.</i>

1347
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,962
<i>You're in a really
touchy situation anyway, right?</i>

1348
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:49,009
You're living with an 18-year-old who used
to be real active on the streets herself.

1349
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,553
-Kim's 20.
-Is she 20 now? Okay.

1350
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,513
[Jerry]
<i>Legally, she is not a foster parent.</i>

1351
01:13:53,597 --> 01:13:57,350
-Well, then give me his phone number!
-[man] Go look in the phone book.

1352
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:00,353
-Under "Jerry Esterly"?
-[man] No, under juvenile parole services.

1353
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:05,400
They're closed, Steve. It's 5-fucking-15
in the fucking afternoon!

1354
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,945
I think it's really good.
You guys are working out like a family.

1355
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,072
And I think
it's a good arrangement for you.

1356
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:15,952
But I don't want you getting busted
and messing that up. Okay?

1357
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:20,248
Right now,
you're charged with selling pot.

1358
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:22,208
So as far as you
staying away from downtown,

1359
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:24,878
I don't care whether you
stay away from downtown or not.

1360
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,630
You've got a lot of friends down there.

1361
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:30,258
I think that you have to use
your own judgment on that.

1362
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:31,843
-Yep
-Okay?

1363
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,763
Uh, you know the things
you'd better not be doing downtown.

1364
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:36,848
-Yeah.
-The police, everybody knows you there.

1365
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:37,932
-Yeah.
-Okay?

1366
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:41,394
If you're dealing dope,
they're gonna bust you again.

1367
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:42,771
And if you get busted again,

1368
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,482
then you're not gonna get out of here
until after your hearing.

1369
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,953
[Rat] <i>She'll start talking about,</i>

1370
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:01,665
<i>"Oh, I wanna have a kid,"
and all this shit.</i>

1371
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:05,335
<i>She just wants to get too serious
at too young of an age.</i>

1372
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,920
Aah!

1373
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,546
<i>She's only 14 years old,</i>

1374
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:11,174
<i>and she makes it sound like
she is ready to get married.</i>

1375
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,928
-Well, then don't leave.
-[sighs] I got to.

1376
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,012
No, you don't.

1377
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:19,015
Yeah, I gotta get Mike
out of juvenile hall.

1378
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:20,100
Why?

1379
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,269
'Cause I can't have
my best friend locked up.

1380
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,563
Gotta go break him out.

1381
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:28,358
[laughs] Check you out.

1382
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:33,113
I'm serious. I'm gonna go break him out.

1383
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:35,407
Then we're gonna go to Florida.

1384
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,909
And what if you get caught?

1385
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:42,163
Oh, well. I'll still be with him. [laughs]

1386
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:45,083
They'll throw me in jail
right along with him.

I can't stand watching you and that dog.

-Uh-uh.

He'll be with you soon.
Then we're gonna leave you alone.

We're not even going
to talk to you no more.

1401

to be mad at me.

-Who's gonna be mad?
-[Tiny] Fuck you, Diane.

1403
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,366
I wouldn't want you to.

1404
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,327
[Tiny] I wouldn't want him to
with you either.

1405
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,336
Somebody's watching.

1407
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,590

-Yeah, she is.

-[Tiny] Bullshit.

1410
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:25,141
-Go ahead and go with her.
-Why do you say that?

1411
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:27,727
Because if you want to, go ahead.

1412
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:29,437
Doesn't matter to me.

1413
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,910

[Tiny] <i>The next day, she felt really bad.</i>

[Tiny] No fucking walls or anything.

1428
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,144
You got one little stair into the bedroom.

1429
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,355
And you can look over to see
there's a whole room in the front.

1430
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:58,651
Then it has a bathroom, right?
It has fucking see-through curtains.

1431
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:01,070
Jumped out the car and went "Pow!"

1432
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:02,739
What's your name?

1433
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,408
Did somebody hurt you?

1434
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,076
What did they do to you?

1435
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,330
Hey, really, I won't hurt you.
See? I'm not...

1436
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:14,208
-Looks like her jaw is broke.
-Her jaw is broken?

1437
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:18,171
She's been banging her head on the wall.
Her eyes are rolling.

-Her tongue was sticking out.

1440
01:19:22,634 --> 01:19:25,929
Come on now. We're here to help you.
I want to look at your eyes for a second.

1441
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:28,681
[Lulu] Think somebody assaulted her,
to tell you the truth.

1442
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,309
-[man] Does anybody know her here?
-[woman] She take any medications?

1443
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:56,876
[woman] You have
a half an hour for visiting.

1444
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,503
[Tiny] A half hour?

1445
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:04,676
-You're stupid!
-I am not. It wasn't my fault.

1446
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:07,762
Well, if you wouldn't have been
in that next room,

1447
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:10,348
hanging your fucking head
out the window, yelling,

1448
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:14,686
"Hey, guys, I'm over here! Look!
What you doing?"

1449
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:16,646
[laughs] I didn't say that!

1450
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,732
Sitting there halfway out the window,
talking to 'em.

1451
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:23,027
Can't ever keep
your fucking head in, can you?

1452
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:26,030
Like Brian says,
"You can take the ho off the street,

1453
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:29,158
but you can't take the street off the ho."

Oh, well. I guess it don't matter to me.
I didn't get arrested.

1456
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:40,253
You're lucky. You're real lucky.

1457
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,256
[Rat] Just gotta stay one step ahead.

1458
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:47,260
-You left me there!
-That's right. I sure did.

1459
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,553
[Tiny] It wasn't my fault.

1460
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,555
You didn't say,
"Hey, Rat, where are you going?

1461
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,056
Hey, Rat, take me with you."

1462
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,893
I would've never got caught.
I wouldn't be in here till Monday.

1463
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:57,729
[Rat] I'll be gone by Monday.

1464
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:01,607
I don't want you to leave.
Why can't you leave till next Sunday?

1465
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:05,153
'Cause I got places to go
and things to do.

1466
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:08,406
Wait till next Sunday. Come on.

1467
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:12,035
This is the last time you guys
get to see me. Or you.

1468
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,369
[Rat] Oh, well.

1469
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:17,248
You missed a good fight there tonight.
Lulu kicked this one whore's ass.

1470
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:22,170
She said, "You bitch," and she fucking
smacked her right in the face.

1471
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,964
You know, she didn't smack her.
She punched her.

1472
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:29,635
Broad fell down, jumped up and just
took off running all the way up to Pike —

1473
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,637
[Tiny] Who was this girl?

1474
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:35,183
She's sort of tall.
She's real skinny, like you.

1475
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:39,520
And she's got real dark,
shod hair, black hair.

1476
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:43,232
I'd show her to you,
but you ain't getting out till Monday,

1477
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:45,485
and I'm leaving Sunday.

1478
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,487
-Why?
-Why?

1479
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,447
Why do you have to leave
a day before I get out?

1480
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:53,993
Why? Because Monday, Mike gets out.
Gonna break him out Monday.

1481
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:56,704
Thump! Take their cuff keys.

1482
01:21:56,788 --> 01:22:02,543
Open the door, take Mike's cuffs off,
and off to Alaska we go. That simple.

1483
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,421
Maybe we'll stop through here
and pick you up.

1484
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:07,840
-[Tiny] Maybe?
-Doubt it.

1485
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:10,802
I doubt it, but maybe.

1486

-Nothing.

1491

Then why you crying?

1492
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:46,462
If nothing's the matter,
why are you crying?

1493
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:49,215
You should have figured it out by now.

1494
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,012
Well, I gotta go.

1495
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:56,472

as, uh, what he saw as just a regular kid.</i>
