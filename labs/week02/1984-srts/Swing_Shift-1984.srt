1
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,482
- Hi, spike. How are you?
- Hi, jack.

2
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,423
She sounds good today.

3
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,538
Come on, boy.

4
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,967
Hi, spike.

5
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,739
- Hi, kay.
- Seen jack?

6
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,609
Yeah, he's out front.

7
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,717
Wesley, get over here.

8
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,690
How you doing, ethel?

9
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,594
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, honey. How are you?

10
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,101
Good. Hope you're hungry.

11
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,968
I'm starving.

12
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,002
Think you can make that any louder?

13
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,412
- Busy day, honey?
- The same old stuff, sweetheart.

14
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,325
How cheap can you get?

15
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,724
Tramp!

16
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,400
- I think she's a singer.
- Singer, my foot.

17
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,941
Saturdays are rotten when you work.

18
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,007
Tell that to the bill collectors, honey.

19
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,941
Free enterprise is killing me.

20
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,002
- I can't make a dime in that dump.
- I know, babe. My feet are killing me.

21
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,140
We'll settle down with a business.
Doing something decent.

22
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,810
I'm going to sell the egyptian. It's a curse.

23
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,853
There's got to be something else
i can do besides run a cheap dance hall.

24
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,333
Biscuits, honey, coming in or what?

25
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,063
There's fine smoking pleasure
in fine tobacco...

26
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,440
and lucky strike means fine tobacco.
So round, so firm...

27
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,644
he said, "do you want the job?"

28
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,521
- Want a balloon?
- Thank you.

29
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,626
It's a war! We're at war!
The goddamn japs bombed hawaii!

30
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,566
The japanese have attacked
pearl harbor, hawaii, by air...

31
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,693
president roosevelt has just announced.

32
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,739
The attack also was made
on naval and military activities...

33
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,070
in the principal islands of oahu.

34
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,742
I have a boy at sea on a destroyer.

35
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,539
For alll know,
he may be on his way to the pacific.

36
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,781
- Two of my children are in...
- mrs. Roosevelt's son's on a destroyer.

37
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,015
Many of you all over this country...

38
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,082
have boys in the services
who now will be called upon...

39
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,924
this american's going to die
with perfect nails.

40
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,593
- You cannot escape things.
- Ethel, hand me that hammer.

41
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,568
I'm telling you, the light's
going to show through that thing.

42
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,739
They said this is how you're supposed
to do it on the radio, hon.

43
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,485
I don't think
it's going to do a bit of good, sweetheart.

44
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:38,045
- You're probably right.
- Let me give you some help.

45
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,089
There. I did it, jack.

46
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,619
I'm going to get you another beer.

47
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,358
I'm signing up tomorrow. I've got to.

48
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,905
I knew you were going to say that.

49
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,369
Honey, snap out of it, will you?

50
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,747
Pearl harbor's one thing,
but the japs aren't going to land here.

51
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,449
How do you know?

52
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,789
First of all, the fishing's been real lousy
off santa monica pier this year.

53
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,999
Second of all, i won't let them.

54
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,173
- What if something happens to you?
- Listen to me, kay.

55
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,466
Nothing's going to happen to me.

56
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,075
But i've got to go.

57
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,840
Damn it, they started it.
We've got to finish it. We've got to.

58
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,408
I've got to go.

59
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,851
- It will be all right.
- Promise?

60
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,388
I promise.

61
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,018
Now, let's see.

62
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,392
A seaman third makes $18.75 a month,
plus $5.00 sea duty.

63
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,559
That's $23.75 i can send you home
every month.

64
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:01,167
Prices might go up because of the war,
so be careful how you spend it. Okay?

65
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,734
- I was thinking i could take something on.
- Like what?

66
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,313
A job. Penney's is looking for salesgirls...

67
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,011
i don't want you doing any such thing.

68
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,546
I don't want you working.
I just want you to be safe.

69
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,790
What am i going to do if i don't have you
to do things for anymore?

70
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,242
That lid sure is swell on you, kay.

71
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,748
I bought it to see you off.
I know you like red.

72
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,415
- Yeah, i like red.
- Section five, move out!

73
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,121
I don't know what i'm going to do
without you, honey.

74
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,989
God, me neither, kay.

75
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,526
Section five, let's move.

76
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,599
Bye, jack!

77
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,671
I said to myself, "frankie parker,
you better get out of here...

78
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,714
"if you ever want to be somebody."

79
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,248
You sing real nice.

80
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,988
- Thank you.
- My unit's shipping out tomorrow.

81
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,616
No fooling.

82
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,854
Here. Find yourself another girl, okay?

83
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,531
Good luck, sweetie.

84
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,963
Biscuits, you said
i could sing tonight, remember?

85
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,439
I got to get a big name up there.

86
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,635
What do you mean, a big name?
You said i could sing tonight.

87
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,304
I got a gold mine here.

88
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,814
This could be a first-class hall
if i play it right.

89
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,683
I'm talking helen forrest, ginny simms,
jo stafford. Not hazel zanussi.

90
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,050
- Know who goes dancing during a war?
- No. Tell me.

91
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,185
- Everybody.
- Biscuits, you told me...

92
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,563
- here you go, boss.
- Thank you, knuckles.

93
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,475
- She takes a good picture, doesn't she?
- Jesus!

94
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,848
So the girls go for me. Is that my fault?

95
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,351
No, i just thought that you and i
were going to get respectable.

96
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,721
- Remember that?
- It's finished. Satisfied?

97
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,620
Now, haven't you got something to do?

98
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,596
I sure do.

99
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,771
Women wanted for war production work
here in our city.

100
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,475
Why?

101
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,876
More and more men are being called
into the armed forces.

102
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,944
Their jobs must be filled, and filled now.

103
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,718
And who can fill them? You. You women.

104
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,955
You're the ones who must fill them,
who can give our boys what they need.

105
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,533
A thousand more planes.

106
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,634
More and more tanks, and more ships.

107
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,515
Good afternoon.

108
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,948
Malcolm macbride,
from my battle station to yours.

109
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,286
I want to take this opportunity
to welcome all the many new associates...

110
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,796
to the macbride aircraft company
here in santa monica.

111
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,796
We are engaged
in a great world struggle...

112
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,563
to maintain our american way of life
as we know it.

113
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,104
The contributions you make at macbride
will ensure our victory.

114
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,344
Again, welcome,
from my battle station to yours.

115
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,407
They got some pretty tight spaces
on those bombers.

116
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,746
You'd be good at that.
Are they asking for references?

117
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,515
You're breathing. That's good enough
for them. They're using everybody.

118
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,025
"My dearest darling, i love you.

119
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,857
"I miss you so much i can hardly stand it."

120
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,593
I've just got to get this job.
Believe me, i do.

121
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,467
- I believe you.
- I've got a kid to feed. Her name is peggy.

122
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,028
Isn't she sweet.

123
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,673
My husband would kill me
if he knew what i was doing.

124
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,734
I'm violet mulligan.

125
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,502
Over here!

126
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,752
- You gotta have your high school diploma.
- I've got it...

127
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,488
attention, new employees.
Long hair is dangerous.

128
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,297
So for safety's sake,
cut your hair or wear a hair net.

129
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,700
- Swing shift, 60 cents an hour.
- Swing shift?

130
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,796
Swing shift: 4:00 to midnight. Okay?

131
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,267
- Great.
- Here's your diploma.

132
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,667
Here's your handbook.
Please read it thoroughly. Next, please.

133
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,409
- Small world.
- Tiny.

134
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,646
- We're neighbors. The balmy palm.
- Yeah, i know who you are.

135
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,050
I thought we could go home together.

136
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,756
You've got a lot of nerve, you know that?
Every time i walk past your place...

137
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,730
all you and your husband can do
is make wisecracks about me.

138
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,030
What the hell do you think i am?
Deaf, dumb, and blind?

139
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:46,874
This itty-bitty thing is not a thumbtack.
It's what we call a rivet.

140
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,011
And this is a rivet gun.

141
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,217
But we don't want you
shooting anybody with it, do we, boys?

142
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:14,736
Get serious here for a moment.
Riveting is real suited to you gals...

143
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,410
because women
are used to repetitive tasks.

144
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:23,178
Believe me, ladies,
as strange as all this may seem...

145
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,376
after training,
you'll use these tools as easily...

146
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,512
as you would a can opener
or a sewing machine needle at home.

147
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,595
- Those are your skinners.
- What?

148
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,735
Your skinners. Your reamer.

149
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,965
- Your bucker-upper.
- Right.

150
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,905
Come on.

151
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,810
Here. Hit it.

152
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,956
Very good.

153
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,958
Very good. Let's do a couple more.

154
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,029
- I think i learned it.
- Okay.

155
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,746
My god! What have i done?

156
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,082
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

157
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,414
Listen to her!

158
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,451
- It's all right.
- Sure, it's ladies' day.

159
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,057
- Bull's eye.
- I could have gone right through you!

160
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,192
It's all right.

161
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,491
Come on, let's go outside.

162
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,298
I'm your leadman.

163
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,276
Just take a deep breath
and you'll get your confidence back.

164
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,378
Okay.

165
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,575
Maybe i just should've stayed at home.

166
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,713
Oh, balls. Look, you... i mean... i'm sorry.

167
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,723
That's okay. My husband used to say that
all the time, "oh, balls."

168
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,862
- It's okay.
- Is he dead?

169
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,754
No.

170
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,066
You okay?

171
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,133
- Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.
- I'm going to watch you for a while.

172
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,142
When you get nervous,
you can hurt yourself.

173
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,978
Okay, thank you. Thanks a lot.

174
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,677
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

175
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,750
Hey, moon!

176
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,273
Darn it.

177
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,943
Move it or lose it, toots!

178
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,849
- I missed my bus.
- Tough.

179
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,054
Yeah, that would've been
about 20 minutes ago.

180
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,302
- You need a lift?
- In that?

181
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,266
It's all i got.

182
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,571
You sure get tired by the end of the day.

183
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,951
- That's my trumpet.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,883
Hold on.

185
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,769
I bought it from a guy
who went to the army.

186
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,863
My husband's in the navy.

187
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,373
Oh, boy.

188
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,000
Hi.

189
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,095
We made it.

190
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,101
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bright and early.

191
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,228
4:00 p.m. It's all so turned around, isn't it?

192
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,033
- My name's lucky.
- Kay walsh.

193
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,133
All the above.

194
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,872
Lucky, that's a funny name.
How did you get it?

195
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,779
I better not tell you. It's kind of dirty.

196
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,115
Evening, mrs. Walsh.

197
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,451
- You just stick with it, kay.
- I will. Thanks.

198
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,048
Guess what, spike? I'm working now!

199
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,275
What are you doing? You're crazy!

200
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,347
Hazel, what are you doing?
There's only perverts out at this hour.

201
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,080
Get out of my way!

202
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,648
You okay?

203
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,829
I think the bike's messed up. Look at it.

204
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,562
I'll give you a ride home.

205
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,971
If you don't leave at the count of five,
i'm calling the cops.

206
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:29,878
- One, two, three...
- you're making a big mistake.

207
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,176
...four...

208
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,273
- quit that racket!
- What's going on out here?

209
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,477
Are you all right? What happened?

210
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,143
- What the hell is going on?
- It's nothing, spike.

211
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,210
It's not the japs or anything.
Just go back to bed.

212
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,199
I like your hair.

213
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,673
Thank you.

214
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,372
Jack would have a heart attack
if he saw me.

215
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,879
- Who's jack?
- My husband.

216
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,712
Right. Mr. Personality.

217
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,781
- I should go home.
- Wait. I made this for you.

218
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,002
My name is kay. What's your name?

219
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,772
- Hazel.
- Hazel?

220
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,803
Yeah. It's my mom's name.

221
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,676
I'd watch you go to work all the time
just to see what new outfit you'd wear.

222
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,475
Thanks.

223
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,707
Are you a singer?

224
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,621
- What is this?
- Hot milk.

225
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,088
- Yeah, i'm a singer.
- I knew it.

226
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,462
Didn't even tell biscuits about my new job.

227
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,299
- Biscuits?
- Just some guy i used to know.

228
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,168
- It's jack, in uniform.
- Right.

229
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,513
If he knew where i was working,
he'd wouldn't believe it.

230
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,576
He'd never picture me
riveting and drilling...

231
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,383
riding motorcycles.

232
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,721
I needed a ride.

233
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,956
- It's none of my beeswax.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

234
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,861
All right, i'm not your husband.

235
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,390
- It was just a ride, and that was all.
- All right! Jesus.

236
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:44,068
I guess i better get going.
Got to work tomorrow.

237
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,979
You got a little mustache.

238
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,119
- Don't worry about that guy.
- What guy?

239
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,053
The one you used to know.
You'll find somebody else.

240
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,926
See you later.

241
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,081
Almost five months
since entering the war...

242
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,677
- the government has proved...
- over there.

243
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,947
There's a space.

244
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,290
What are you doing?

245
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,027
Buddy, who the hell do you think you are?

246
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,400
I'm going to tell you who i am.
I'm moon willis.

247
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,338
I've worked at this damn place
for 12 long years.

248
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,807
This is my parking space.
I ain't about to lose it...

249
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,367
to a bunch of fly-by-night women like you.

250
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,777
You don't belong here, none of you!

251
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,052
What's his trouble?

252
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,754
We were just coming in here.
I saw that parking place...

253
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,195
and then he pulled in...

254
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,726
- you haven't quit yet.
- No. We have to win the war, don't we?

255
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,103
I just try to pay the bills
and stay out of trouble, myself.

256
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,847
- What's troubling you?
- I'd like a left-handed lock wire plier.

257
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,850
Lou, we got another patsy!

258
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,598
Stick out your left hand.

259
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,328
There. Now you got
a left-hand lock wire plier.

260
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,130
- Got it?
- Yeah, i got it.

261
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,572
Now remember it.

262
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,944
All you gotta say is, "listen, you big ape.

263
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,845
"You ever pull that on me again,
i'll slap your ears off."

264
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,341
"Listen, you big ape."

265
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,413
Back to work, ladies.

266
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,781
Listen, you big, fat ape!

267
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,715
Yeah.

268
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,691
- Where's my left-hand lock wire pliers?
- Listen here...

269
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,292
- listen?
- You big...

270
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,964
- big what?
- Big fat...

271
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,670
she's so gorgeous.

272
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,938
Have a seat.

273
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,043
Sorry.

274
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,915
- Thank you.
- Hi.

275
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,615
- How you doing?
- The days are getting longer.

276
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,285
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

277
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,987
- What did you say it for?
- I don't know.

278
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,530
You seem a little uncomfortable.

279
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,096
Where's your motorcycle?

280
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,728
I'm taking my poke at hitler. Saving gas.

281
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,463
Where are you from, kay?

282
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,102
We're from lowa,
my husband jack and me.

283
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,776
I'm playing my horn tonight.
You want to come hear me?

284
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,277
- No. I have a million things to do.
- I'm not bad.

285
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,914
- It's a cute little place, next corner.
- No. I have to write jack a letter.

286
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,550
- And i have a lot to do.
- I understand.

287
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,657
So what about you? You like good music?

288
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,587
- You addressing me?
- Correct.

289
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,225
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.

290
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,793
My mother always said someday
i'd meet a wonderful girl like you.

291
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,668
See you tomorrow, kay.

292
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,805
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

293
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,994
...taking us one step closer
to the big victory!

294
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,556
Okay!

295
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,074
- Talk to you a minute, kay?
- Sure.

296
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,814
- Some guys can't take "no" for an answer.
- Yeah, i know.

297
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,084
You said it.

298
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,222
I think our line is moving really fast,
don't you?

299
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,927
Last chance, kay.

300
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:21,228
Kelly's, saturday night.
Lucky lockhart and his hot jazz trumpet.

301
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,973
It's great working with you...

302
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,207
and i think you're the best leadman
on the line...

303
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,611
and i just know you're a swell fellow.

304
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,515
But you've been asking me out every week
for the last five months...

305
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,820
and i keep having to turn you down.

306
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,527
People are beginning to talk.

307
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,364
I'm just trying to improve
your taste in music, kay.

308
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,533
But you won't
have to turn me down again.

309
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,346
Don't be late or i'll dock you, mrs. Walsh.

310
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,197
Attention, please.

311
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,664
We have just received news
of another tragic loss.

312
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,541
The japanese
have sunk the uss carrier hornet...

313
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,237
defending guadalcanal.

314
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,779
I know many of you swing shifters
have husbands...

315
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,443
sons, and sweethearts on guadalcanal.

316
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,483
We must work harder to help turn the tide.

317
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,021
Signing off.

318
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,706
If he asks me out tonight,
i'll tell him not to bother me anymore.

319
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,273
It's up to you.

320
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:17,384
Maybe you could come along,
just to keep things safe.

321
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,186
Why not? Come on.
What're you gonna do?

322
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,889
You're off tomorrow.
You're gonna sit at home?

323
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,989
I thought i could whip up
a batch of victory fudge.

324
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,332
Look, honey, you don't need me.
I got faith in you.

325
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,061
You do?

326
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,796
Sure.

327
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,804
I really like you, hazel.

328
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,642
A lot.

329
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,815
- Gee, kay, i really like you, too.
- No, i really like you...

330
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,583
all right, don't get sentimental on me.

331
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,996
- You wanted to tell me something?
- Thank you.

332
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:18,040
- I think you're a swell guy.
- I think you are terrific.

333
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:24,913
You know, there are a lot of great girls
at the plant.

334
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,083
- Millions.
- Single gals.

335
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,784
Lots of them, too. So?

336
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,392
Spike and ethel, my landlords.

337
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,299
What's the matter?

338
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,674
What's wrong?

339
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,869
- Kay?
- Sorry.

340
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,914
- Wait a minute.
- Excuse me.

341
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,775
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

342
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,217
What're you doing? Wait a minute.

343
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,885
Taxi!

344
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,564
Excuse me.

345
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,299
- Wait a minute!
- I can't...

346
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,100
- what the hell...
- i can't. I'm married.

347
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,405
- So what? So that's it?
- It's wrong.

348
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,671
Come on, kay.

349
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,942
It's your own life.
You've got a right to be happy.

350
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,243
I can't.

351
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,647
I'm married. Don't you understand that?

352
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,683
Don't you get it?

353
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,959
Please...

354
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,932
go away.

355
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,577
- Come on, i'll give you a ride home.
- No.

356
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,740
Come on, kay.
Just come out of the alley.

357
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,811
Suit yourself.

358
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,128
Kay, hazel, look!
I got another letter from al.

359
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,865
And it's only two months old.

360
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,602
If you had me to keep you company
you wouldn't need vitamins.

361
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:29,635
All these guys think they're god's gift,
every last one of them.

362
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,081
- Sweetie, it's always been that way.
- You're right.

363
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,244
There she is.

364
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,049
Mrs. Sherman. Ladies.

365
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,422
Are you mrs. Jeannie sherman?

366
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,152
Yes.

367
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:51,294
The wife of cpl. Albert sherman,
glendale, california?

368
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,871
I'm sorry to inform you that...

369
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,142
- oh, god.
- I'm sorry.

370
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,848
I've never done this before.

371
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,901
Associates...

372
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,997
congratulations for having surpassed
our 1942 quota.

373
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,469
Celebrate a good year's work
at the swing shift jamboree.

374
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,975
Remember, the swing shift jamboree...

375
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,280
this saturday night
at the egyptian ballroom.

376
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,689
United states naval forces
have destroyed...

377
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,660
twenty-three japanese warships
and transports...

378
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,658
peewee, where did you get that dress?

379
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,497
The museum?

380
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,260
No good?

381
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,330
You got a swell shape, sweetheart.
Why are you afraid to show it?

382
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,037
- Jack doesn't like revealing things.
- So? Let him wear it.

383
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:15,042
- I don't want to go to the dance anyway.
- Good. Me neither.

384
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,645
- You like it up or down?
- I like it up.

385
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,657
That's the war news tonight,
for november 17.

386
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,763
I just thought since it's down the street,
you know, that little place...

387
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,670
the egyptian ballroom?

388
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,302
I've had it with that place.
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

389
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,674
Me, either. Dumb idea.

390
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,010
The egyptian ballroom.

391
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,913
Swing shift jamboree.

392
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,784
Stupid. God.

393
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,152
We could just stay home
and do something.

394
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,483
Sure.

395
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,533
We could clean out your kitchen drawers.

396
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,370
Sure. We could do that.

397
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,068
They'll probably think
we're stuck-up for not going.

398
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,342
- So?
- Who cares?

399
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,141
- I don't care.
- I know.

400
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,845
Okay.

401
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,011
Got any aces?

402
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,794
Are you absolutely sure
you don't want to go?

403
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,056
That dress looks ridiculous.

404
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,226
- It does?
- We'll work on it.

405
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,028
I'll fix you up.

406
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,031
I'm getting it!

407
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,054
- Hi, hazel.
- How are you doing?

408
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,995
- I thought you'd never make it.
- Come on!

409
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:11,024
- Who's the new girl?
- Not right now, okay? Later.

410
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,634
Honey, is this check okay?

411
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,871
- Care to dance?
- Yeah, sure.

412
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,931
I didn't think i was ever gonna
see you again, but you show up.

413
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,337
Here we are back at the egyptian,
just like old times.

414
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,369
- I knew i shouldn't have come here.
- Not true.

415
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,277
You're got to see
what fate has in store for you.

416
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:35,216
'Cause just when you think you're through
and life has got you beat...

417
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,421
it comes right back to you,
stronger than ever.

418
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,654
And everything's good again. Just like us.

419
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,658
I came here tonight
to be with my friends, biscuits.

420
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,793
There's plenty of nice guys at the plant...

421
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,498
we have swell times.
And you don't look so beat to me.

422
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,938
This place is doing great.

423
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,670
You probably got all the money
and the girls you can handle.

424
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,971
- What you've always wanted, isn't it?
- It's what i always wanted.

425
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:09,213
Why don't you go on inside
and enjoy yourself with your new friends?

426
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,380
I think i'd like to just finish my cigarette,
if you don't mind.

427
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,766
Someday i'm going to do something
that'll surprise you. You wait and see.

428
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,415
I don't know much about music,
but you were just terrific.

429
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,318
Thanks. I really am a musician.
I'm not a mechanic.

430
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,987
- Working at macbride's is killing me.
- Why aren't you in the service?

431
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,491
- I'm a jap spy.
- Aren't you ever serious about anything?

432
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,065
What is there to be serious about?

433
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,867
Everything. The war, the nazis...

434
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,369
winston churchill.

435
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,842
I think you look prettier
without all that stuff.

436
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,551
You're too good-looking for that.

437
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,794
Do you want a ride home?

438
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,019
Get inside. I'm getting wet.

439
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,091
Gosh, i'm freezing.

440
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,358
And i'm starving.

441
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,264
- That's not all.
- What else am i?

442
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,599
- For one thing, you're all wet.
- I know.

443
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,332
Your make-up's probably
in your nylons by now.

444
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:20,402
- What did you think i was going to say?
- Nothing.

445
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,238
You know me better than that.
I'd have made an unacceptable suggestion.

446
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,408
Come on, you always do that to me.
What's your suggestion?

447
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,918
I happen to make the best cheese omelet
in the world.

448
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,478
- Change your clothes.
- How about you?

449
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,183
Change into what?

450
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,988
- This?
- Forget it.

451
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,624
Or this?

452
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:44,530
- I'll catch pneumonia first.
- It's this or this. Take your choice.

453
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,402
- How much longer? I'm starving.
- Hold on another minute.

454
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,566
- Why?
- Here's why.

455
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,472
Lucky, you're pretty good.

456
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,146
Stop it. It's just a little something
i whipped up.

457
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:04,085
- You do this to me all the time.
- Lucky, the things you do.

458
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,185
- How about a little supper music?
- Sure.

459
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,964
Skylark.

460
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,298
No good?

461
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,300
No, it's okay. I just play it a lot
when i'm alone, that's all.

462
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,942
Too loud?

463
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,327
Do you know this?

464
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,742
This old mouthpiece.
It's getting hard to hit the high notes.

465
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,540
No excuses. Really.

466
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,613
Aren't you gonna eat?

467
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,651
In a minute.

468
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,421
I looked all over for you at the jamboree.

469
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,024
Never did get to dance with you.

470
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,990
Would you like to?

471
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,511
Did you meet jack in high school?

472
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,378
Four-year letter man. In what?

473
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,780
Basketball, baseball, track, football.

474
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,919
- He was quite an athlete.
- He still is, i'm sure.

475
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,939
How come you never asked me
if i was 4f?

476
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,280
I don't know.

477
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,108
Just in case
you ever wondered about it, i am.

478
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,521
The army turned me down.

479
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,749
- I flunked my physical.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,119
Don't be. It's not worth it.

481
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,887
I'm not sick. I'm just 4f.

482
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:06,300
- 4f, that's all.
- It's not like they called you a dirty name.

483
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,833
It isn't.

484
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,240
Skip it. If it hadn't have been for the war...

485
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,508
nobody would have said a thing
about my bad heart.

486
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,878
Besides, it doesn't bother me.

487
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,016
Yeah, i can see that.

488
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,723
It bothers me a little.

489
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,226
Mainly with making girls nervous.

490
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,791
Making girls nervous? How?

491
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,299
- If you saw me do something strenuous...
- you wouldn't want me to worry.

492
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,465
- Exactly.
- That's very considerate.

493
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,838
Thanks.

494
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,904
I just want you to enjoy yourself naturally.

495
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,448
You were just so sure
you could get me into bed...

496
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,984
you didn't want me to be nervous
about your bad heart.

497
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,381
- I don't have a bad heart.
- I'm telling you, i don't care.

498
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:03,485
I don't know how
you even let me get into this.

499
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,428
- Get you into what?
- You know what.

500
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,397
- I don't have to spell it out.
- I'd like to think you helped.

501
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,764
- We made love to each other.
- Repeat that.

502
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,632
I'm not gonna make myself any clearer.

503
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:17,036
Are you telling me
i'm the one responsible for all this...

504
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,234
when you've been asking me out forever
and i keep saying no?

505
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,870
- And all the time you meant yes.
- I didn't. I meant no.

506
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,914
Somebody around here said yes.

507
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:29,680
- I said yes because i felt sorry for you.
- Sure, and there's a war going on.

508
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,153
- Get out of here!
- What's it look like i'm doing?

509
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,157
- Do it faster, then.
- I won't even put on my shoes.

510
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,054
- I never want to see you again.
- Slow down.

511
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,421
Never.

512
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:52,098
- Who is it?
- Me.

513
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:02,178
I don't know what we're talking about.
We've got to go back to work in 12 hours.

514
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:10,490
I don't understand why it had to happen
in the first place, that's all.

515
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,361
World war ii?

516
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,786
No.

517
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,465
Why did we have to end up
working together?

518
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,437
- Kay, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

519
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,068
I just wondered.

520
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,641
I'll never see you again...

521
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:35,913
except monday through friday
from 4:00 till midnight, every swing shift.

522
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,749
If you were any kind of gentleman...

523
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,350
i'd what? Work graveyard?

524
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,220
What?

525
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,459
You wouldn't know so much about me.

526
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,301
Everywhere. In my work, in my life.

527
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,378
How do i ever get rid of you?

528
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,149
You can't, i hope.

529
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,602
Is that bad?

530
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,464
I don't know.

531
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,044
I guess we're in it.

532
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,579
For the duration. Oh, boy.

533
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,555
You don't have to get rid of it.
You just blew your nose.

534
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,952
We made those.

535
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,048
- Sweetheart.
- Yeah?

536
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,585
- Good morning. What's up?
- Allies into palermo. Axis on the run.

537
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,597
- You want one?
- Sure.

538
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:05,965
Out joy riding,
using up that black market gas?

539
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,999
Yeah, spike, that's what you use
when you go joy riding.

540
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,802
Lucky and hazel invited me
to go to the beach.

541
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,667
They must have thought
i was getting lonely.

542
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,175
Bye, lucky. Thanks.

543
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,110
- Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

544
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,081
See you soon, hon.

545
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,952
You ought to come next time, spike.
We had a real swell time.

546
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,429
That's good. Set it at 25.

547
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,730
Where do we stand now on this?

548
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,088
Kay was so wonderful, wasn't she?

549
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,291
Good night.

550
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,318
Five guys. Yeah, like that.

551
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,993
- Lucky, you seen kay?
- Yeah.

552
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,999
She got called to personnel
before the shift ended.

553
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,402
- I think they're going to give her a medal.
- She saved violet's life.

554
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,704
Guess what?
They're making me a leadman.

555
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,437
- Leadman?
- Yes!

556
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,509
They said i was fast on my feet.
Macbride shook my hand.

557
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:08,608
I told him the line was moving too fast,
that's what happened.

558
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,552
They just smiled
and handed you a promotion, right?

559
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,946
I thought you'd be proud of me.

560
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,786
So we're still going to get together
later on?

561
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,253
Sure.

562
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:27,035
I am proud. Really.

563
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,331
- Thanks.
- Good night, lucky.

564
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,317
Here it is, girls!

565
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,116
- Look!
- We're here.

566
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,520
This is wonderful.

567
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,564
This is better than anything.

568
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,463
This place...

569
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,807
the music...

570
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,339
dancing with you.

571
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,045
It's pretty damn good.

572
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,380
I wish it could be like this forever.

573
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,386
Why not?

574
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,039
Isn't it unusual for somebody
with your amazing looks to be a riveter?

575
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:48,509
No, it's amazing for someone
with my unusual looks to be a riveter.

576
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,273
- Touche.
- Touche?

577
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,177
That means you wounded me. Slightly.

578
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:55,445
You've got quite a line in palaver:
The come-on, the french lesson.

579
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,214
You're quite a dancer.
What's your room number?

580
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,447
There you go,
beating around the bush again.

581
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:05,153
Paging smn amtzis,
sgt. Mccloud, smn touie.

582
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,924
If i came on a little bit strong, i apologize.

583
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,469
Hi, hazel.

584
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,040
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

585
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,633
- All right, who's this guy?
- Pardon me.

586
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,871
Pardon me, sir.

587
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,772
- Isn't your...
- beat it, buddy.

588
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,079
Propel your french elsewhere, sir,
and au revoir.

589
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,915
That means scram, all right?

590
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,584
Good evening, mrs. Zanussi. Seaman.

591
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,385
Beat it, all right?

592
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,188
Same old light touch, hazel?

593
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,031
I don't know why i did that.

594
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,132
Smn touie? What...

595
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,799
something in our life
keeps bringing you and me together.

596
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,501
I'm shipping out tonight.

597
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,771
- Tonight?
- Yeah. I'm glad, though.

598
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:58,143
Because now i can tell you i'm sorry.

599
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:01,080
For frankie, the broads,
the promises, everything.

600
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:05,587
- I messed up real bad with you, hazel.
- You talk like you're going to die.

601
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,187
Come on, touie. Let's go.

602
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,790
Take care of yourself, hazel.

603
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,509
- Happy new year, doll.
- It's almost midnight.

604
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,688
Out of uniform, buddy?

605
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,056
I don't have a uniform, buddy.

606
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,593
Don't push me! Take a hike!

607
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:49,961
Is that what you want?

608
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,626
You want a piece of me, asshole?
Come and get it!

609
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,134
- Wait a minute!
- No!

610
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,533
Ten, nine, everybody!

611
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:05,273
Eight, seven, six, five...

612
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:09,473
four, three, two, one!

613
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,544
Happy new year!

614
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,388
June 6, 1944, d-day.

615
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,534
American, british, and canadian troops
landed in northern france this morning.

616
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,695
Stand by
for general eisenhower's broadcast...

617
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,296
as the allies launch this great invasion.

618
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,240
Soldiers, sailors, and airmen
on the allied expeditionary force...

619
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,146
you're about to embark upon
the great crusade...

620
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,350
toward which we've striven
these many months.

621
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:47,822
In company with our brave allies
and brothers-in-arms on other fronts...

622
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:51,152
you will bring about the destruction
of the german war machine.

623
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:54,924
The elimination of nazi tyranny
over the oppressed peoples of europe...

624
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,797
and security for ourselves
in the free world. Good luck.

625
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:02,468
And let us all beseech the blessing
of almighty god...

626
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,632
upon this great and noble undertaking.

627
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,610
Associates, back to work!

628
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,514
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.

629
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,983
- The shirt's from hazel.
- Really?

630
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,586
Just give me a minute. I'll be right back.
I forgot something.

631
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,921
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, lucky.

632
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,894
All right.

633
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:34,194
- What is it?
- My contribution to your musical career.

634
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,873
You like it?

635
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,434
Jesus, kay.

636
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,136
- Baby, thanks.
- You're welcome.

637
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,808
It's me!

638
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,806
Kay, i'm home!

639
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,712
- Who wants a beer?
- I do.

640
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,121
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,221
Is my wife here?

642
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,126
Is kay here?

643
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,629
Kay, look who's here.

644
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,826
Watch this.

645
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,778
- I don't believe it.
- I'm on liberty.

646
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,243
- I brought you a rose.
- Thanks.

647
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,724
- This is lucky.
- Hi.

648
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,827
- Lucky, nice to meet you.
- And hazel.

649
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,262
We all work together.

650
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,663
- Come on, let's...
- excuse us.

651
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,744
We're shipping out again in 48 hours.

652
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,347
Couldn't tell anybody we were coming in.
Couldn't breathe a word about it.

653
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,282
- How about that?
- That's something.

654
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,392
Kay, where...

655
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,343
- what is it, honey?
- Who's the leadman?

656
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,045
Anybody i know?

657
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,924
- Yeah, it's somebody you know.
- Who is it?

658
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,596
- It's me. I'm the leadman.
- You?

659
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,594
See.

660
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,206
I got a promotion.

661
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,778
- That's great.
- Thanks.

662
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,912
I came in to try on my civvies
and see what they felt like...

663
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,678
- but they didn't seem to be here.
- I'm sorry, honey.

664
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,024
This closet, it's full of equipment and stuff.

665
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,154
It's like fibber mcgee's closet.
But they're in boxes...

666
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,997
no. Don't bother with it, kay.
I can't wear them anyway.

667
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,533
I'll just wear them in the house.

668
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,668
I'm sorry. My gosh.

669
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,709
What a mess.

670
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,376
Congratulations.

671
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,280
Thanks.

672
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,891
- You got it.
- Yeah, i got it.

673
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,051
- Got it all over everything.
- Good job.

674
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,656
Thanks.

675
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,925
Did you have a good rest?

676
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,500
Sure did.

677
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,705
- Welcome home, honey.
- Thanks.

678
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,753
So are you going to change that?

679
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,659
Sure, honey.

680
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:39,168
So, like i said, congratulations. Congrats.

681
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,903
- For what?
- You know.

682
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:47,246
- What did you say you were making?
- $1.35 an hour.

683
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,182
- What did you say about overtime?
- I didn't.

684
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,081
Beats me, anyway.

685
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,059
Beats me all to hell. Here's to you, kiddo.

686
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,064
And that guy you work with...

687
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,490
what's his name?

688
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:06,994
Lucky.

689
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,267
- There's no question about that.
- What do you mean?

690
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,872
He's stateside. He's not in uniform.
How lucky can he get?

691
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,678
I don't think he'd call it lucky.

692
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,582
The next time you go to work,
ask him what he'd call it...

693
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,142
and where i might stand in line to get it.

694
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,916
What would you call it, jack?

695
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,217
I'd call it cheating, kay.

696
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,359
I went to war!

697
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,766
- I know.
- So who else got lucky besides lucky?

698
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,045
Didn't it mean anything?

699
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,379
That you're my wife?

700
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,415
Of course it meant something.

701
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:09,524
I tried to wait but everything in this house
reminded me of you...

702
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,997
sure, baby.

703
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,899
Blame it on the war.
It's everybody's excuse.

704
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,966
I'm not the same.

705
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,605
And neither are you.

706
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,576
I'm sorry.

707
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,551
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

708
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,619
Do you love this guy?

709
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,211
Jack, please forgive me.

710
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,053
- Moon told me about that.
- See you tomorrow.

711
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:13,292
What the hell are you doing here?

712
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,455
- Thought you were sick.
- Talk to you a minute, hazel?

713
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:17,624
Sure.

714
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,932
Come on, violet, let's go pick up peggy.

715
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,164
Good night, hazel.

716
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,539
Listen, i'm playing at kelly's
later on tonight.

717
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,244
Want to come?

718
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,909
I don't think so.

719
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:38,917
All right.

720
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,454
- Suit yourself.
- You going to be all right?

721
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,598
Never better.

722
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,553
Is this seat taken?

723
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,801
One scotch.

724
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:16,042
- You're leaving so early...
- i couldn't sleep.

725
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,676
I got to get out of here.

726
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,045
- Did you read my note?
- No.

727
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,315
What does the note say, jack?

728
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,517
What's it say?

729
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:30,021
I can't believe what you've done.

730
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,527
Honey, i'm sorry.

731
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,498
All right. Let's get out of here.

732
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,792
"Dear kay...

733
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,722
"I don't understand what you've done,
but I guess you're right.

734
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,928
"Everything changes.

735
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:10,137
"I'm different, you're different,
the whole world is different.

736
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,666
"I don't know what's right anymore.

737
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,575
"I guess we both
have a lot of thinking to do.

738
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,909
"I'll try and write
when I'm not so confused.

739
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:22,744
"They say the war will be over soon.

740
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,948
"I hope so.
It's sure taken its toll on all of us.

741
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,255
"All the best. Jack."

742
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:05,421
What did you think of the guys
i played with last night?

743
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,825
They were okay. You were better.

744
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:14,329
They're heading back east
in a couple of weeks.

745
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,530
I could probably work it out
to go with them.

746
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,475
What's the matter, hazel?

747
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,553
It's not gonna be so hot
telling kay about this.

748
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,484
What's the big hurry in telling her?

749
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:40,926
Besides, i'm the one
with the broken heart, remember?

750
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,165
I don't think i can look her in the eye
until i do.

751
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,283
Wait a minute!

752
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:48,857
Come in.

753
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,139
God. I don't even recognize the place.

754
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,315
- Would you like some tea?
- Some tea?

755
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,556
I'll take some tea.

756
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,363
Jack's mother gave me this tea set
when we were married.

757
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,437
Really? It's lovely.

758
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,107
Thank you.

759
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,074
Cream?

760
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:42,882
Yes, please.

761
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,512
Sugar?

762
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,378
You got sugar?

763
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,517
How many sugars?

764
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,188
No sugar. Thanks.

765
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:03,062
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

766
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,804
Sandwich?

767
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,742
Kay, seeing you with jack
made lucky nuts.

768
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:16,613
I was lonely. It's not gonna happen again.

769
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,317
Who would have thought
this would happen to us?

770
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,593
What are we gonna do about this?

771
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,837
We'll all be friends.

772
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,145
What else?

773
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,711
All right!

774
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,049
Thank you.

775
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,819
- Waiter.
- Hold on.

776
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,591
Honey, don't you think
you'd better take it easy?

777
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:11,826
- Why? We're celebrating, aren't we?
- What are we celebrating?

778
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,596
Everything. Friendship.

779
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,368
So, here we are.

780
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:29,678
- You still blow a mean horn, lucky.
- Glad you liked it, kay.

781
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,912
Hazel liked it, too. Didn't you, haz?

782
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,687
- Fresh circle.
- Fresh circle?

783
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,249
Another round.

784
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:47,033
To lucky and hazel.

785
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,269
Kay and jack.

786
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,372
Here's mud in your eye.

787
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:58,871
- Kay, why don't you slow down?
- Don't tell me what to do.

788
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,117
Isn't it funny how things happen so fast?

789
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,984
You've had too much to drink,
so why don't you slow down?

790
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,045
Isn't it?

791
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,188
Yeah, it's funny.

792
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:14,551
All the time
that lucky and i were together...

793
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:19,192
and all the time that hazel and i
were best friends, i never knew.

794
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,828
It wasn't like that. I told you,
it happened all of a sudden.

795
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,131
Come on. I thought you said
we were gonna be friends.

796
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,143
Friends are the most
important thing, right?

797
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,941
- Here's to good music.
- Right, hazel?

798
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,583
Lots of things are important.

799
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,710
But friends are the most important thing.

800
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,415
Good friends. Friends you can trust.

801
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:45,152
You mean like husbands are supposed
to be able to trust their wives?

802
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,955
- Tone it, hazel.
- Will you shut up!

803
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:50,930
The way your love life was going, i don't
blame you for taking what you could get.

804
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,023
Thanks, kay.

805
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,160
What about you, jack, and lucky?
That made a real pretty picture.

806
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:58,728
That was me and jack and lucky!
This is me and you and lucky!

807
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,832
All right, that's it. You two don't need me.

808
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,003
Nope, i'm going.
You're on your own, sweetheart.

809
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:10,450
- There's a word for you.
- Stay away from me!

810
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,179
Only i can't say it.

811
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,216
Yes, i can. Whore!

812
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:18,453
- Did you call me a whore?
- See anybody else i could be speaking to?

813
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,324
- You're the whore, sweetheart.
- You're a bigger whore!

814
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,559
I've slept with someone's boyfriend,
but i didn't spend two years...

815
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,362
putting a knife in my husband's back.
You're the whore.

816
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,459
What do you know?

817
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:32,165
You never had a husband or boyfriend!
You never had anything!

818
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,604
There's nothing wrong with me, kay.

819
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:39,204
I don't care what happens to you or him.
So why don't you just go away, okay?

820
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,606
Ride?

821
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,611
- Where to, sweetie?
- Wait a minute.

822
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,746
Get your hands off me! Get away from me!

823
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:49,913
Let's just go.

824
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,827
- I was in love!
- Shut up!

825
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,399
- Come on, kay. I'll get you home.
- Don't touch me!

826
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,336
How're you gonna get home?

827
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,068
If i can build a goddamn airplane
i can get myself home.

828
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,232
How do you feel?

829
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,208
I feel sick.

830
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,050
I called macbride's this morning and quit.

831
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,122
I'm leaving.

832
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:13,902
You want this back?

833
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:17,637
No. I'd really like you to keep that.

834
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,775
Me, too. Thanks.

835
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,782
Come with me, kay.

836
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:32,487
I can't.

837
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,549
Bye, kay.

838
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:09,453
Mabel stoddard's husband is in the pacific.
She took this job for the duration.

839
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,625
Mrs. Stoddard, how do you like your job?

840
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,724
I love it.

841
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,429
How about after the war?
Do you plan to keep on working?

842
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:20,235
As i said, when my husband comes back,
i'm gonna be busy at home.

843
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:21,798
Good for you.

844
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:27,481
Each returning serviceman
will get his job back when the war is won.

845
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:32,709
You girls and women, you'll go home,
back to being housewives and mothers...

846
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:35,483
as you promised to do
when you came to work with us.

847
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:38,117
Your lives will return to normal.

848
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,791
Thank you.

849
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,431
Thank you.

850
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,006
Attention, please.

851
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,705
The ceremony commemorating
the last sbd dive bomber...

852
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:06,083
produced by macbride's
will start in a few moments.

853
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:19,559
Associates, we share
a great moment in history.

854
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:23,094
Japan has surrendered. The war is over!

855
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,612
Associates...

856
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:38,948
excuse me! Can we have
some quiet, please, for mr. Macbride?

857
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,720
Associates, I want to thank each
and every one of you...

858
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,817
for a job well done!

859
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,603
They dropped us, just like that. I knew it.

860
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,813
...knowing you have done your part
to bring peace to a strife-torn world.

861
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:14,013
Especially you girls
who've given so much...

862
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,578
good luck to you.

863
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:18,455
...now you can become
housewives and mothers again...

864
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:21,962
to make homes and families
for all our returning heroes.

865
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,658
"Last hired, first fired."

866
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,900
They're taking away
the best job i ever had.

867
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,727
A year of welding school.

868
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:42,676
Shirt?

869
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,639
"Dear lucky,
I was cleaning house yesterday...

870
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:20,347
"when I came across these pictures
of our going-away party at macbride's.

871
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:21,945
"I thought you might like them.

872
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,992
"I haven't heard from jack in a while,
but I've been notified...

873
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:29,962
"of his fleet's arrival next week.
I'm hoping for the best.

874
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,632
"I know things got muddled in the end...

875
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,430
"but I just want to say thanks
for so many things.

876
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:39,667
"I sure hope things are finally
going your way. Good luck, kay."

877
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,971
Please forgive me.

878
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,610
You're forgiven.

879
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:01,279
- How did you get here?
- I borrowed spike and ethel's car.

880
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,792
Come on. Let's go home.

881
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:12,697
- Can i help you with this, or anything?
- No, i got it.

882
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,091
Put your bag down.

883
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:55,600
I went to the store
and got something special for dinner.

884
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,804
Unless you'd rather go out.

885
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,083
Where is he?

886
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,484
It's over.

887
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,684
That's good news.

888
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,652
I know i hurt you, honey.

889
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:21,799
I love you.

890
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,541
Still working?

891
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,286
They let us go when it was all over.

892
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,489
That makes two of us.

893
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,689
We're both out of a job.

894
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,172
I just love you so goddamn much.

895
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,538
I love you, too.

896
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:51,452
- Jeannie, what's this?
- It's called dip.

897
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:54,426
- Yeah?
- You stick a potato chip in it.

898
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:57,957
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

899
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:03,864
Everybody, i'd like to introduce
to all of you...

900
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,202
this is my new husband,
archibald touie.

901
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:07,763
How do you do?

902
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,776
A washer?

903
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,747
All electric.

904
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:19,177
It tore a shirt the other day.

905
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,852
- Hi, everybody.
- Kay!

906
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:26,258
This is jack, my husband.
He just got back.

907
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:31,395
I'm clarence. Welcome home, boy.

908
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:33,699
- This is annie.
- Hi, annie.

909
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:37,260
The government's promised us
a new ranch house in the valley.

910
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:40,532
- They're building a whole bunch of them.
- Ranch house, terrific.

911
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:41,870
They're all alike, too.

912
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:46,276
With these servicemen coming back,
there's gonna be a large need for housing.

913
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:51,514
Hi, i just wanted to say...

914
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,445
congratulations.

915
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:58,556
Thank you. This is my husband,
archibald touie.

916
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,890
- Biscuits touie.
- Nice to meet you.

917
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:02,360
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

918
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,955
- So you were in the pacific?
- You bet. Yup.

919
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:06,961
You hear about these new ranch houses?

920
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:10,902
I just want to forget about the past
and start all over again.

921
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:15,503
With another little one on the way,
i'm sure glad deacon has a job.

922
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:18,704
Remember that first day
when we were all standing in line?

923
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,110
I was so scared.

924
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,617
- I thought they were gonna laugh at us.
- They did laugh at us.

925
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:27,443
- Well, we showed them.
- We sure did.

926
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:32,182
We showed them.

927
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:39,398
Here's to kay and jack,
jeannie and bobby...

928
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:42,368
clarence and annie, violet and deacon...

929
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,470
and hazel and me.

930
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,172
And all of us.

931
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:51,405
And no more war. One hell of a future!

932
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,077
All right!

933
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,779
We showed them, didn't we?

934
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:39,942
Boy, did we ever.

935
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,522
English
