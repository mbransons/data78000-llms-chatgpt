1
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,349
I can't believe they don't have one good rock station.

2
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,253
Are you kidding me, boy? That's stompin' music.

3
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,290
This will be our last post. So let's just tough it out.

4
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,673
Morning. Sergeant major Zack Carey.

5
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:09,642
Morning, sergeant major. Welcome to fort Clemmons.

6
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,945
Is this all yours? Personal belongings.

7
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:15,648
Never said I travel light soldier.

8
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,861
Oh, put it on that side.

9
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,351
Sergeant major Carey!

10
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,820
Sergeant major Carey! Yeah, you calling me?

11
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,055
Sergeant major Carey? Yeah, that’s me.

12
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,392
I'm Jerry Elliott from soldier magazine.

13
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:33,001
We'd like to interview you, and take a few pictures, if that would be alright.

14
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,365
I just got here myself Elliott.

15
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,901
How the hell did you guys find me so quick?

16
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,838
You aren't exactly the unknown soldier in this army.

17
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,808
What's a soldier's magazine's interest in interviewing me?

18
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,812
Well sergeant major, you're the only one in the U.S. army

19
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:52,950
Who owns his own fully operational sherman tank for one thing

20
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:55,818
Are you kidding me? I thought everybody had one of these.

21
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,290
I knew a sergeant in Ft. Bliss who made a lamp out of one.

22
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,767
How long did it take you to restore it?

23
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,403
Oh…close to 15 years.

24
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,705
Spare part here, spare part there.

25
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:18,510
Did it mostly with my two sons on weekends. How old are your sons?

26
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,412
Well, Billy, he's 16,

27
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,747
And Jonathan... Would be 22.

28
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:24,383
He's dead.

29
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,818
I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,554
Is this tank all original?

31
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:34,825
Everything except the loudspeaker and tape deck. I put those in for parades and such.

32
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,830
That way, it could be declared a public relations asset.

33
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,834
Why in the hell would anybody want a sherman tank?

34
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,438
Because it's very hard to shoot yourself while cleaning it.

35
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,441
One, two, three, four, hey!

36
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,076
One, two, three, four, hey!

37
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,380
This is the way we start our day!

38
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:56,949
This is the way we start our day!

39
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:58,685
Knockin' down doors and kickin' down walls!

40
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,722
Knockin' down doors and kickin' down walls!

41
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:04,858
Yes. General Hubik,

42
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,828
Sergeant major Carey to see you sir.

43
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:09,863
Great. Send him in.

44
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:17,906
Reporting for duty, sir.

45
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,975
Good to see you, general.

46
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,178
Well, well, for an old fart, you look great.

47
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,914
With your permission, I could say the same about you.

48
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:28,950
How's Ladonna?

49
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,586
Fine, sir. And your wife?

50
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,788
She has her moments. All squared away?

51
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,591
Just about.

52
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:39,528
There's a staff sergeant named elliott running around looking for you.

53
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,730
He already found me, sir.

54
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:45,501
He got me before I had a chance to test the latrines in this installation.

55
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,171
We're going for a drive.

56
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,041
You're creating quite a stir with that tank of yours.

57
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,077
I had to pull quite a few strings to let you keep it here.

58
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,847
I appreciate that, sir. If I may say so,

59
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:00,218
I'm glad my last assignment is going to be under you, sir.

60
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,754
We're both a little too young to be talking about last assignments.

61
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,857
Yes, sir, but I have made an offer on a fishing boat.

62
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,827
If they accept it, I'll put in my papers.

63
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,730
You give me two years on this post Zach,

64
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:16,833
And you just may very well be the next sergeant major of the army.

65
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,118
General Hubik, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that coming from you,

66
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,854
But it gets a little complicated.

67
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:39,057
I only have one son left.

68
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,993
He's only got a few more years at home.

69
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:46,931
That time won't ever come again. I've learned anything, I’ve learned that sir.

70
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,266
Well, there'll be time to talk about that later.

71
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,536
Pentagon duty isn't half bad for a family.

72
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,604
Neither is fishing, sir.

73
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,140
In your hat, sergeant major.

74
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,676
Yes, sir, general sir, three bags full.

75
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,979
Road guard, recover!

76
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:07,587
Next?

77
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,589
Kitchen.

78
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:11,658
I've talked with your mom and dad.

79
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,859
What about you?

80
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:13,961
What's it like

81
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,496
Having a command sergeant major for a father?

82
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,600
Made me more religious I suppose.

83
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,969
Really? How's that?

84
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:26,838
Made me more aware of the problems Jesus must have had as a teenager.

85
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:27,907
Being the son of God.

86
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,578
What sort of father is your dad?

87
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,681
A cross between George Patton and Danny Thomas.

88
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:38,751
I mean like he says, “Shit rolls downhill…”

89
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:39,987
“..and if it's a bad day at the post,”

90
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,856
“..you better believe it's the wrong day to look like a ragbag around the house."

91
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,860
You call that guy about the boat?

92
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,260
Yeah.

93
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,730
You didn't tell me. You didn't ask me.

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,700
Shouldn’t have to ask you something like that, jesus it’s like pulling teeth to get any information out of you.

95
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,800
What did the guy say say? He said he’d call back in a couple of weeks and let us know if they’ll take our offer or not.

96
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,710
Probably waiting to see if they can get more.

97
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,070
I just hope the interest rates don't go up by then. What if they do?

98
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,210
They won't go up. What if they do?

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,810
What am I supposed to do? Just go in there and tell them

100
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,220
“They can’t do that because Ladonna Carey said that the interest rate won’t go up?”

101
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,950
I swear to Jesus you’re about as nervous about that boat as you are about that tank.

102
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,830
Go to the NCO club, have a beer. See if we know anybody on this post.

103
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,730
You're a pretty good old broad.

104
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,230
Just watch who you're calling old.

105
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,740
Jesus, you're a nervous old woman.

106
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,740
Give me a bud.

107
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,410
What?

108
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,180
Give me a beer!

109
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Hey, Carey!

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,770
Carey!

111
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,770
Hi, Tippet. Hey how you been? Good to see you.

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,770
What they got you doing here?

113
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,770
I'm operations NCO with the provost marshal.

114
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,880
How's yourself? I'm good. You look good.

115
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,880
Look, I want you to meet my wife. Christ, I know Linda.

116
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,980
Uh... No, no. Big mistake.

117
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,420
Linda is the old wife. New wife is Gwen.

118
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,830
Must not make the mistake of calling new wife old wife's name.

119
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,430
She'll be upside your head with a pool cue.

120
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,290
Hi. See anybody we know?

121
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,990
Ed Tippet.

122
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,290
Oh yeah? Was Linda there too?

123
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,290
No, but Gwen was. Who's Gwen?

124
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,980
Gwen is new wife. Linda is old wife.

125
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,760
They got divorced?

126
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,870
I guess so.

127
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,740
Christ, I used to love to go to the NCO Club.

128
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,170
Not anymore.

129
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Not unless you like to sit around on your can and play bingo,

130
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Or go to the disco and dance the funky monkey,

131
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,420
Or whatever they call that stuff they’re blaring in there.

132
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,850
They don't even call them bars anymore.

133
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,920
It’s gotta be a disco. I don't want to go to a disco.

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,920
I want to go to a bar.

135
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,760
You're acting like the most crotchety old bugger I've ever seen in my life.

136
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,870
Why don’t you get in this bed and I'll show you just how young you really are.

137
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,070
Why, miss Scarlett, how you do talk.

138
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,060
I just want to get that boat. I want to finish things up

139
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,790
And get on that boat, that's all.

140
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,200
Hey. Hey, what?

141
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,830
G.I. Want a good piece of ass?

142
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,170
I love you.

143
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
You better.

144
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,820
Gentlemen, the division sergeant major.

145
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,830
At ease.

146
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,840
Who’s this guy? Is he some kinda hard-ass?

147
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,870
He’s one of these guys went in at 16, something like that. Probably got a wino to sign for him.

148
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,880
I got a wino to sign for me too. After he did, I said, "thanks, dad."

149
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,180
You still had to buy him a bottle of booze, didn’t ya?

150
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,080
Gentlemen, be seated.

151
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,390
My name is sergeant major Zack Carey.

152
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,060
I usually find these little chats are about as full of crap as a Christmas goose,

153
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,400
so I'll keep it as short as possible.

154
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,200
Gentlemen, the bottom line is we’re gonna get our collective shit together.

155
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,270
We’re gonna make this outfit combat-ready.

156
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,940
Coming over here today,

157
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,280
I saw a couple of individuals on this installation walking around looking like a ragbag.

158
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,180
That stops now.

159
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,220
Normally, if I was a battalion sergeant major, company first sergeant,

160
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,250
Some clown starts telling me how to run my people,

161
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,660
I'm gonna personally tell him to keep his nose out of my business.

162
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,930
But these are not normal times,

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,060
So I will park in your pockets gentlemen.

164
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,030
Where quality of training is concerned, there are going to be more details later.

165
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,940
Where quality of life is concerned,

166
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,900
We will take care of our people's problems.

167
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,280
Whatever it takes to keep our people's minds on their work,

168
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,210
and not their personal problems, that's what we’re going to do.

169
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,220
For me, at least, the army is family.

170
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,920
We will take care of our own

171
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,690
By the book, but with tact...

172
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,330
And by tact I mean don't let the bullshit reach the brass.

173
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,600
We will handle our problems in-house.

174
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,560
Because when a problem leaves your hands, and reaches

175
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:49,570
your company or battalion commander's hands,

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,270
You better believe it’s going to come to the attention of that 600-pound gorilla

177
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,170
With the two stars on his collar.

178
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,140
And shit rolls downhill.

179
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,280
Keep that gorilla off my back,

180
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,350
That'll keep me off yours.

181
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,220
Now there’s one other thing. I want a beer bar on this post with a soft jukebox

182
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,490
So old farts like me, and a few others out there can sip our suds in peace

183
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,530
And not have to dance the funky monkey.

184
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,960
That’s it for now, thank you, gentlemen.

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,320
Your division sergeant major,

186
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,220
is all alone on the battalion field!

187
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,050
Morning, sergeant major. And a fine one it is.

188
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,350
Would you and your men care to take the air with me?

189
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,980
It would be the highlight of our day.

190
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,620
Battalion!

191
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,390
Company, right face!

192
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,690
Forward battalion, march! Hoo!

193
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,590
Column left, march!

194
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,630
Double time!

195
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,290
I'm gonna rock the livin' day!

196
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,260
Shake, rattle, and roll, everybody!

197
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,060
Shake, rattle, and roll, everybody!

198
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Shake, shake, shake a little longer!

199
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,580
Shake, rattle, and roll, hey!

200
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,750
Pick 'em up! Set 'em down!

201
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,620
Rock it! All right!

202
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,490
Here we go!

203
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,830
Bye, mom.

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,640
Ladonna!

205
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,840
Billy! Ladonna! We did it!

206
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,170
What’s going on? Why don’t you help me with some of these grocery bags.

207
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,710
Grocery bags? Lady, do you have any idea who you're talking to?

208
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,710
We got the boat? You better believe we got the boat.

209
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,550
Broker just called, said they took our offer, locked in at the same rate.

210
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,550
Yahoo!

211
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,190
What do you say we just forget about that ham in the oven

212
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,860
And have a real celebration, just you and me?

213
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,670
That ham isn't for us, I told you I have the NCO wives' club meeting here tonight.

214
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,200
I told you that, you said you'd eat out.

215
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,140
Christ LaDonna, screw the NCO wives.

216
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,640
Let's go celebrate. I can't do that, they're coming here, I can't do it.

217
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,440
Hells bells LaDona, best news I've had in 10 years, Billy's out on a date,

218
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,450
And you've got that crew of Amazons!

219
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,780
I told you five times they were comin' here tonight.

220
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,990
Why don't you have dinner in town?

221
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,760
One of these days, I'll go to beautician school.

222
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,200
I did all my girlfriends' hair in high school.

223
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,770
Yeah?

224
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,670
Maybe I'll go to California.

225
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,370
I heard about this girl in playboy ya know? She had her very own barber shop.

226
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
That's what I want, my own place.

227
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,880
No crap from nobody.

228
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,780
I'll drink to that, to no more crap.

229
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,820
Maybe that's what I'll name my boat - the no more crap.

230
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,620
Maybe I'll just name it after you. Sarah.

231
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,890
That's it. The Sarah.

232
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:30,730
Long may she sail.

233
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,930
The Sarah.

234
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,530
I've been in the army almost 30 years.

235
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
'Bout time I went Navy.

236
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,600
How would you like to hear a song?

237
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,240
Gonna play the jukebox?

238
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
No I'm not gonna play the jukebox, I'm gonna give you a rare priveledge.

239
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,280
And a treat. I'm gonna sing you an old sea shanty

240
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,750
In the key of z-flat.

241
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,290
* when I was a little boy *

242
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,690
* so my mother told me *

243
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,890
* way, haul away

244
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
* we'll haul away, Joe

245
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,860
* if I did not kiss the girls *

246
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,730
* my lips would grow all moldy *

247
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,730
* way, haul away

248
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,440
* we'll haul away, Joe

249
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,770
Come on, shoot the ball.

250
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,780
How much have I made off you already?

251
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,950
* way, haul away

252
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,750
Christ, I'm making 40 bucks an hour.

253
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,650
* away, Joe. Then he got... *

254
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,490
Shoot the ball.

255
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,950
Shit!

256
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,890
Why don't you just shut up from here on out, ya hear?

257
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,760
I'll bust your head.

258
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,390
Hey!

259
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,700
You wanna cut out that warbling? Can't you see there's a game going on?

260
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,670
Aw well, I'm sorry about that, deputy, I apologize.

261
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,800
Bad manners to be singing while there's a game going on.

262
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,410
C'mon over, I'll buy you a beer.

263
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,010
I don't need you to buy me no beer.

264
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,080
And you Sarah, you're supposed to be turning tricks, girl.

265
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,550
You've wasted enough time on this old boy.

266
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,560
Probably couldn't get it up anyway.

267
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,660
So you just get your ass up off that barstool bitch and start earning some money.

268
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,730
Hey hey hey, you don't want to do that.

269
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,900
Say what?

270
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,830
There's no need for that, that's all.

271
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,100
I'll tell you what there ain't no need for. Ain't no need for no army scumbag

272
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,440
To come up here and tell me what to do in my town,

273
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,970
with my whore.

274
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,640
You know something deputy?

275
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,410
You're right. You're just as right as rain.

276
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,480
Your town, your whore.

277
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,450
Is that right?

278
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,400
You proved your point.

279
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,940
Deputy, let me ask you a question.

280
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,340
How would you like it if someone went...

281
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,960
He's got the gun!

282
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,550
Why did you have to go and do that?

283
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,450
He only slapped me around a little.

284
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,020
I could have lost my job, asshole!

285
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,590
No need to get sentimental about it.

286
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,560
A simple "thank you" would do.

287
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,180
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

288
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,820
What the hell is all that racket?

289
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,460
Zack?

290
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,230
What's the problem man? It's 2:00 in the morning.

291
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,130
We got to talk Ed.

292
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,540
I did an El dummo. I'll admit it.

293
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,810
I been in enough of these cracker towns,

294
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,980
I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts the local constabulary

295
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,980
will be in provost marshal's office in the morning

296
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,510
Looking to stick my ass in jail.

297
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,980
You gonna pay for the damages?

298
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,590
Well sure, sure. I'll pay the guy as much as 500 to cool things out.

299
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,060
You might have to go higher than that.

300
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,630
The sheriff's a mean cracker.

301
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,710
Morning, sheriff.

302
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,920
Good morning.

303
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,220
Would you all like some coffee?

304
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,760
Thank you kindly. I believe I would.

305
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,990
In my office, please, Euclid.

306
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,150
Yes, sir.

307
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Euclid?

308
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,640
Yes, sir?

309
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,710
Where is he?

310
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,120
Who's that, sheriff?

311
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,150
He's not in my jail.

312
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,660
And I don't see no arrest report.

313
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,760
On who, sir?

314
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,760
He in the hospital?

315
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,830
I'd like to believe that's the case.

316
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,000
Um... Sheriff...

317
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,740
I... Uh...

318
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,000
Or is he in the morgue?

319
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,240
But if he's in the morgue, there ought to be a report in here on him.

320
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,610
Don't you care about your paperwork Euclid?

321
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,010
Sheriff, I'm not, uh...

322
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,150
Not really sure what you mean sir.

323
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,350
Well, look at your face, son.

324
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,220
Somebody marked up your face when you was on duty,

325
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,260
and when on duty, you represent me.

326
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,130
Yes, sir.

327
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,770
Now who was it that marked you up while you was out representing me?

328
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,670
Because now I'm walkin' around with marks on my face,

329
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,040
and that, I can't have.

330
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,190
Spell me.

331
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,700
He's out there, I saw it, big as life.

332
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,170
Well, Jesus Christ!

333
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,970
That son of a bitch has got a hell of a nerve.

334
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,240
Jesus Christ on a crutch!

335
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,910
Hell! That's just a breach of professional etiquette.

336
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,910
Coming into my mess hall, without calling me?

337
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,880
Pulling some kind of surprise inspection, in my kitchen without letting me know he's comin'?

338
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,750
It's just a breach of professional etiquette.

339
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,150
That fool think I'm playing, he got another thing comin'.

340
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,220
I'm gonna get me a meat cleaver.

341
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,160
I'll breach that mother's skull.

342
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,970
Sergeant major Carey?

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,970
This is a breach of etiquette, you understand?

344
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
I don't have to take this off of nobody.

345
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,440
This is my mess hall,

346
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,710
and you keep your nose out of my business.

347
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,250
27 years I've been running mess halls.

348
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,150
Dwight D. Eisenhower ate my cooking,

349
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,850
and I don't stand for no surprise inspections from anybody.

350
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,090
Sergeant, I came in here because the food smelled good,

351
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,190
I wanted to eat with soldiers,

352
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,160
Not over at the NCO Country club.

353
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,160
The food's excellent. Our food is excellent.

354
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,400
Place is clean. I run a clean mess hall.

355
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,370
Service is good, nobody slops the food on the plate.

356
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
Served with pride, respect.

357
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Nobody slop my food, I'll slop them upside the head!

358
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,110
You're doing an excellent job sergeant, my compliments to you and your entire staff.

359
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,380
You taste that apple cobbler?

360
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,510
I was just getting ready to do that.

361
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,120
well, you gonna talk about my food, you taste that apple cobbler.

362
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,130
Then you talk about the food.

363
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,900
Sergeant. Yeah?

364
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,360
That's the best fucking apple cobbler I ever tasted.

365
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,070
Give that man some seconds!

366
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,450
Morning, Sarah.

367
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,050
Morning, sheriff.

368
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,020
Sarah, do you believe in Wonder Woman?

369
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,960
Who?

370
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,060
Wonder woman, you know. Like on the TV. Do you believe in Wonder Woman?

371
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
No, sir.

372
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,070
Well, now, that's good.

373
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,570
But how about the Lone Ranger?

374
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,610
Do you think there's really a Lone Ranger, like they have in the comic books?

375
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,280
Sheriff, I don't know what you're talking about.

376
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,210
Would you just answer the question, sister Sarah.

377
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,920
Do you believe in the Lone Ranger?

378
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,780
No, sir.

379
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,290
Ah, liar, liar, pants on fire!

380
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,060
You do believe in the Lone Ranger, and you think he wears army green,

381
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,830
and that's a dangerous thing for a lady in your position, ya think?

382
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,170
You see Sarah, you do business with them people, of course.

383
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,600
But that's all.

384
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,210
You don't get personal with them.

385
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,310
Cause they ain't our kind.

386
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,080
That's a lesson you're gonna have to learn little lady. You got to learn it good.

387
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,120
So...

388
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,190
Pull up your little shirt there.

389
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,990
Take down the drawers.

390
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,620
Turn over. Get to it.

391
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,700
I'm going to teach you

392
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,970
That there really and truly, ain't no Lone Ranger.

393
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,050
I got this one.

394
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,620
I'd like to see the provost marshal.

395
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,620
Good morning sheriff. He's not in right now, maybe I can help you.

396
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,630
Well, maybe you can.

397
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,330
I don't know who he is, but I bet you do.

398
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,200
He's a sergeant. Master sergeant, or some such thing.

399
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,100
First name's Zack.

400
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,710
He's wanted for battery on one of my deputies last night,

401
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,180
D&D, and whatever else I can think of.

402
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,610
There's no need to look no further sheriff,

403
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,550
cause we got him. That's good, cause I want him.

404
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,150
Can't. He turned himself in to the MP's last night.

405
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,620
He's gonna be one sorry sergeant major when we get through with him.

406
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,420
Uh, in the meantime, if you just tell me how much he has to pay for damages and all…

407
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,160
He'll pay, all right.

408
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,630
But first, he's gonna spend some time in my jail.

409
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,630
Ya know sheriff, it's lucky you and me got a chance to talk.

410
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,340
I'm just gonna save you all kinds of paperwork.

411
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,570
I'm sure you're aware of the recent supreme court decision,

412
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,640
Uh, Clarence versus Kern county,

413
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,510
where the high court ruled that all military personnel,

414
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,180
committing a crime in civilian jurisdiction...

415
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't want to hear this supreme court crap!

416
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,350
I want that son of a bitch.

417
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,190
I want his name I can put on a warrant. I want him here so I can take him to my jail.

418
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,090
Now do you understand that, boy?

419
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,130
Yes, sir.

420
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,130
Yes sir, I sure do.

421
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,110
The military don't want no trouble for your town.

422
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,710
I'll have that man up here for you in 15 minutes.

423
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Now that's what I like to hear.

424
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,690
Because if you want that man that bad,

425
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,650
You got a bad problem, we just got to nip it right in the bud.

426
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,650
Well I don't see you making any calls to locate my man.

427
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,630
I'll have that son of a bitch up here for you in 12 minutes, with cuffs on behind his back.

428
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,360
Will that about do it for you? It'll be fine if you get to doin it.

429
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,670
And by 5:00 this afternoon, that whole town of yours will be declared off-limits,

430
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,440
to all military personnel.

431
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,070
Cause we sure don't want you to have any problems with the army so,

432
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,640
you take him, go ahead and take him.

433
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,180
And by 5 o'clock you won't have to worry about seeing soldiers

434
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,650
in any of your bars,

435
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,650
or your restaurants, or your stores, or your whorehouses.

436
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,820
If that don't cure your problem, I don't know what will.

437
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,660
Okay, sambo. You win this one.

438
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,230
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

439
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,970
You better believe there is, Jim.

440
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,270
Oh by the way...

441
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,640
You best watch how you drive off this post.

442
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,640
Cause this is a federal installation.

443
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,680
You break the speed limit here, you'll be spending time in my jail.

444
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Euclid!

445
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,190
I want to know everything there is to know about that sergeant major.

446
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,890
I want it all, and I want it today.

447
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,870
Hold him still.

448
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,970
It's ok, it's going to be ok.

449
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,450
Daddy's not mad at you anymore.

450
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,820
It's okay, Brian.

451
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,360
Come in.

452
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,470
Corporal Harris reporting sergeant major. You wanted to see me?

453
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,440
Sit down, corporal.

454
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,340
I was over at the post hospital today, I saw your son.

455
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,780
He's pretty badly beat up. Did you do it?

456
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,350
As much as I know about the army sir, that's none of your business.

457
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,290
If you want I can call in the provost marshall, but...

458
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,790
Call the provost, nobody's pressing any charges.

459
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,360
Hey, corporal, I'm just having a personal chat with you, you want to make it hard? I'll make it hard.

460
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,800
Now, I'm trying to keep this inside this office, but you're being dumb.

461
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,300
Well, fine then. Let's just keep it in the office.

462
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,340
I know you got your wife and kids scared they won't file out a complaint.

463
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,340
Well, sooner or later, that's going to blow up in your face.

464
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,810
I just don't want it to ever get to that point.

465
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,580
We got good counseling on this post.

466
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,350
I want you to volunteer for some. Nobody will know about it.

467
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
I'll keep this quiet as possible.

468
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,960
But you need some help, son. Is that it?

469
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,660
You're not going for it?

470
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,960
Am I dismissed?

471
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,330
Let me put it to you another way.

472
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,500
The next time you feel like you're losing control,

473
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,270
and want to hit somebody, you come see me. You come hit me.

474
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,810
We can go over to the gym, put on the gloves or we can just duke it out...

475
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,880
Look. What goes on in my family is my business!

476
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,050
It's not your goddamn...

477
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,550
Now you hear this, asshole!

478
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm gonna check that hospital every day.

479
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,820
If that boy's ever in there again with a mark on him, I will destroy you.

480
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,130
My retirement won't mean shit to me, my stripes won't mean shit to me,

481
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,300
The stockade won't mean shit to me.

482
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,360
I'll destroy you in a heartbeat!

483
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,300
Do you believe that? Do you?

484
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,570
Yes, sergeant major.

485
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,710
You will get some counseling. Dismissed!

486
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,600
Hi, bill.

487
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,170
Hi, dad.

488
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,840
Where's your mom? Shopping, I guess.

489
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,780
You're cracking the books a little early, aren't you?

490
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,950
I've got basketball practice and an early date.

491
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,920
Smells like mom's cooking up a pretty good dinner.

492
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,920
Did you check that early date out with her?

493
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,860
Yeah, I told her this morning.

494
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,830
Think you'll miss some pretty good ham, son.

495
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,970
Oh, Christ.

496
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,900
I'm getting too old for it.

497
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,840
For ham?

498
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,510
No, all the bullshit.

499
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,570
I had a clown in my office today,

500
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,840
Beat up his kid. 5-year-old boy.

501
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,680
Could've broken his neck.

502
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,950
When you think about people, raise a kid right, then he gets killed,

503
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,350
and you see something like that.

504
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,820
Turns your stomach.

505
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,190
Dad? I was thinking.

506
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,100
If we get that boat,

507
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,700
maybe we could call it Johnny boy, or something like that. How about we do that?

508
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,570
I don't need a boat to remind me of your brother.

509
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,710
I just thought it'd be kinda nice, since he was your favorite and all.

510
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,050
Wait. You want to run that by me one more time?

511
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Not really.

512
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,060
Bill... Come over here.

513
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,960
Come over and sit down.

514
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,830
Billy, do you ever think that I wish it was you,

515
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,970
instead of your brother that was dead?

516
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,110
That question sucks dad. Yes, it does.

517
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,140
It'd be rotten if you felt that way, and it wouldn't be true.

518
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,580
Johnny was your first-born.

519
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,120
It's only natural you and mom would feel something more for him.

520
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,120
Makes sense, doesn't it? No, it doesn't.

521
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,860
We felt something different for him, cause he was a different person,

522
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,190
but not anything more or better.

523
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,200
Mom always said you and Johnny were exactly alike.

524
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,670
You had to feel something more.

525
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,000
We were alot alike. That's why when he was a little boy we got along so well

526
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,740
But when he got to be a teenager, not so much.

527
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,710
He always felt he had to prove things to me.

528
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,310
Maybe that's why he got killed.

529
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,720
But I swear to you Bill. Not once, not ever for one second

530
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,080
Did I wish it was you instead of him that got it.

531
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,520
You straight on that?

532
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,460
Yes, sir.

533
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,000
I got to go.

534
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,540
Bill?

535
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
You squared away on all that?

536
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,010
Yes, sir.

537
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,760
Break it up!

538
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,080
William Carey!

539
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,610
Yes, sir?

540
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,090
Mr. Taylor would like to speak to you.

541
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,600
I don't understand Mr. Taylor. Why do you want to see my locker?

542
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,730
Well, it might be nothing at all Billy,

543
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,970
It's just something we want to check out.

544
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,600
Billy, these two men are deputy sheriffs.

545
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,010
They'd like to ask you some questions.

546
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,770
Is this your locker?

547
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,640
Yes, sir.

548
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
Want to open it up please?

549
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,050
That's not my lock.

550
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,020
Just open the locker.

551
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,620
That's not my lock.

552
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,010
Honest Mr. Taylor, that's not my lock.

553
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,890
Can someone please tell me what's going on here?

554
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,030
Billy, the sheriff's office has received some reports

555
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,210
That you've been selling marijuana on the campus.

556
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,960
But that's not true!

557
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,500
Would you ask the janitor to open that locker please?

558
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,040
Go ahead.

559
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,740
Excuse me.

560
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,020
Well, well, well.

561
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,320
Lookee what we got here.

562
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,620
I'd like to see the sheriff, please.

563
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,060
Well, right this way there, general.

564
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,430
Right this way.

565
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,010
Someone to see you, sheriff.

566
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,700
Okay.

567
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,070
Sheriff says okay.

568
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,010
Well, sheriff, uh...

569
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,650
Buelton.

570
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,550
My name is Zack Carey.

571
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,590
I did a real dumb thing in your town the other night,

572
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,520
Then tried to weasel out of it.

573
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,490
I'm sorry. You win, I lose.

574
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,990
Now, what do I have to do to get my son back?

575
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,070
Euclid, could you come in here and bring your camera please?

576
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,070
You wouldn't mind posin' for a picture with me, would you?

577
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,880
If not, sergeant,

578
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,050
Back over against that wall.

579
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,580
Right over here.

580
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,550
You see, Euclid's never seen a talking asshole before,

581
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,390
And I'd like him to have a souvenir photo of it.

582
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,660
All right, euclid.

583
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,500
I think I'll call this,

584
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,600
"Sheriff buelton gets his man,"

585
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,240
Unless you got a better idea.

586
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,080
Well, let's see what we got here, sergeant.

587
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,740
"William Carey...

588
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,050
"Possession of narcotics,

589
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,620
"Possession with intent to sell same,

590
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,050
"Assaulting a peace officer,

591
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,490
and resisting arrest. "

592
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,760
Now, if I know the judge...

593
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,090
I reckon I ought to know him, he's my brother-in-law...

594
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,560
This would be enough to get that little boy of yours

595
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,930
at least two years on the county farm, maybe three.

596
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,030
All right, sheriff,

597
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,030
Like I said, you win, I lose.

598
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,570
You come up with a number, and I'll pay.

599
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,010
You get right down to the heart of the matter, don't you sergeant?

600
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,950
I'm going to let you come up with the number,

601
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,680
But after you've had a chance to visit our correctional facility.

602
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,690
Move it! Move it!

603
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,390
Come on, boy!

604
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,530
Move it! Move it! Move it!

605
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,390
Come on, boy!

606
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,600
Come on, come on. Hurry!

607
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,350
We practice a modern form of penology here.

608
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,350
We try to rehabilitate the prisoners,

609
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,390
through a system of positive and negative feedback.

610
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
You take the work here, that's a privilege.

611
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,390
And that's positive feedback.

612
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,760
On the other hand, well...

613
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,530
Trustee Jackson!

614
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,060
Yeah, boss!

615
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,030
Can we see an example of negative feedback please?

616
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,600
Right now, boss.

617
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,010
You, boy!

618
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,050
You're lazy! That's what's the matter with you!

619
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,020
Ok sheriff, I get the point.

620
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,090
I'm impressed, you don't need to carry this little scene out for me.

621
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,060
No, sergeant, this ain't the army.

622
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,560
Here I say the "have-tos"

623
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,560
And "don't have-tos."

624
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,400
I say that youngster's malingering.

625
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,700
That's an example of antisocial behavior that calls for negative feedback.

626
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,070
Shut up!

627
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,070
Shut up! Shut up boy!

628
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,540
You're just lazy. That's all that's wrong!

629
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,790
Well I hope you found our little tour helpful.

630
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Just give me a number sheriff, and you got it.

631
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,090
That's the trouble with your kind.

632
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,760
You don't appreciate subtlety.

633
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,570
You all come down here and change our ways of living,

634
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,440
because you got the US supreme court on your side.

635
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,640
But, I reckon you're finding out we ain't broken-legged.

636
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,580
You want a number? $10,000.

637
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:29,850
Sheriff, I don't know what do you think the army pays these days...

638
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,050
Well I wouldn't know sergeant. I'm just an ignorant cracker,

639
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,690
But I did hear that soldier magazine wrote a story on you.

640
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,790
Said you was uh, let's see, what'd they say? You owned your own tank,

641
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,090
and just bought a big fancy boat.

642
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,860
Well shoot, that sounds like some kind of millionaire to an old poor boy like me.

643
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,700
Sheriff, I've spent 30....I bet, I bet you could sell that boat

644
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,470
and raise that kind of money right now.

645
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
Oh, sergeant...

646
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,190
Uh... One more thing.

647
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,730
I think it would be inadvisable

648
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,530
for you to get the idea of bringing some Jew lawyer down here

649
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,730
to talk about civil rights.

650
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,970
Cause you do that, I'll have that little boy of yours on this farm

651
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,710
Before you can say "habeas corpus. "

652
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,710
Okay, sheriff, you'll get everything you want,

653
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,180
But you remember this, anything happens to my boy,

654
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,720
nothing you can do will prevent me from killing you.

655
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,220
He's the only thing keeping you alive.

656
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
And vice versa, sergeant.

657
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,630
You remember that.

658
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,720
Billy, are you okay?

659
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,720
Dad, I didn't do what they say.

660
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,560
I didn't do anything, somebody's else's lock was on my locker.

661
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,860
I know, I know, it doesn't have anything to do with you.

662
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,730
Dad, it's gotta have something to do with me, cause I'm the one that got sent to this jail. No Billy, it's the sheriff.

663
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,130
The sheriff's using you to get me, that's why he put you in here, to get me.

664
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,100
I'm gonna do exactly what he wants, then you're out of here.

665
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,970
But why, dad?

666
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,740
It's a long story.

667
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,280
Once you're out of here, I'll tell you the whole thing.

668
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,210
But the bottom line is, you're going to get out of here, you understand?

669
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,250
Okay. Do you think you can you hang in here just a little bit longer?

670
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,620
Yes, sir. That's exactly the way I want you to talk to these guys...

671
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,130
"Yes, sir" and "no, sir. "

672
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,600
In a little while, day or two at the most,

673
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,260
you'll be out of here, I promise you that.

674
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,800
I've never broken a promise to you have I?

675
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,270
No, sir.

676
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,610
I'm not gonna start now. I promise you,

677
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,140
I will get you out of here.

678
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,280
That's a promise.

679
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,290
Bastard! You rotten, filthy son of a bitching bastard!

680
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,130
My baby's in jail, because you wanna go out whoring.

681
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,630
Alright, we'll pay the man the money and we'll get Billy back,

682
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,970
Then you do whatever you feel you have to do.

683
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,440
Oh, no.

684
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,270
Look, LaDonna I've got this thing figured out.

685
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,810
We can cut those bills right in half...

686
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,680
No! We are getting a lawyer! And that's all there is to it!

687
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,280
Our son is not gonna be handled

688
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,750
Between good ol' boys.

689
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,720
You have no right to even talk to me about it.

690
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,760
LaDonna you don't understand. This guy's an evil man.

691
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,690
We're not doing things his way, and we are not doing things your way.

692
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,360
I'm getting our son a lawyer. You have no right to tell me different.

693
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,170
You left your rights on a barroom floor!

694
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,770
Ladonna! Ladonna!

695
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,840
All right, you talk to a lawyer, find out what can be done,

696
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,280
But don't you take any action that'll get to that sheriff

697
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,580
without telling me first.

698
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,880
I'll do the same. Okay?

699
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,380
Okay?

700
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,090
Zack!

701
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,160
Zack!

702
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,500
First sergeant, take over the inspection.

703
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,210
What is it LaDonna?

704
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,220
I tried, Zack. I didn't understand what you meant.

705
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,750
I didn't believe you. Believe me about what?

706
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,560
About the sheriff. Oh, Christ!

707
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,790
Move over.

708
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,750
He's here, sheriff.

709
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,090
Well, lookee who's here... Mr. stupid.

710
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,630
You are as dumb as you can be.

711
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,730
I told this man not to bring lawyers in on this,

712
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,300
But he wouldn't listen to me, he's too smart.

713
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:14,540
You see sergeant, we get some big lawyer in like that from out of county,

714
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,210
We don't want to waste his valuable time,

715
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,280
So we went right ahead and held a trial. Now you know what?

716
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,350
Your lawyer's in jail... contempt of court.

717
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,620
We'll finish this conversation in my office.

718
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,870
Take the money sheriff,

719
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,780
Give me my son.

720
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,180
Please.

721
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Oh, you do know the magic word.

722
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,010
Sergeant, it's my sad duty to report to you

723
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,820
that your son was found guilty, and has been sentenced

724
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,620
to three years on the county farm.

725
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,860
But, I'll take the money.

726
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,830
It'll keep him alive for a year.

727
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,300
After that, maybe I'll take some more and you'll get him back.

728
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,470
Damn it sheriff, we made a deal!

729
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,500
but any more lawyer noise,

730
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,310
And that kid is gonna be shot trying to escape.

731
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,610
Yes, sir.

732
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,780
I got the power to do just about anything on that farm,

733
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,910
Except stop the course of true love.

734
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,380
That I can't do.

735
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,320
You see, unfortunately,

736
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,460
We do have some degenerates down there on the farm.

737
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,490
Unless I've missed my guess,

738
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,460
they'll fall in love with that little boy of yours.

739
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,830
Of course, it will be

740
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,630
A learnin' experience for him.

741
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,670
Sheriff told me why I was in here,

742
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,440
before he beat me up,

743
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,480
'cause of you and your whore! Bill.

744
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,010
Was she worth it dad?

745
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,720
Look at me!

746
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,040
Hubik.

747
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,640
Are you sure?

748
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,850
Well, stop him. Block the main gate.

749
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,220
All right, all right! I'm coming!

750
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,760
Somebody better have a damn good reason for banging on that door this early in the morning,

751
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,830
or they're gonna spend some time in my jail.

752
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,100
Oh, lord.

753
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,740
I do believe I got you covered.

754
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,840
Oh, Jesus.

755
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,110
Oh, lord. Uh... Uh...

756
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,550
Please, mister. I...

757
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,420
Now bring my son out.

758
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,820
Don't be cute. I'm in a bad mood.

759
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,720
Oh Jesus, I want to, sergeant, I swear to Jesus,

760
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,190
But the sheriff thought you might pull some of that legal stuff so,

761
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,900
he had your boy transferred to the county farm last night.

762
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,730
I put him on the work detail right away.

763
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:44,470
Who's inside the jail?

764
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,370
Uh... Just a couple of drunks.

765
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,180
He's lying.

766
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,840
Shut your mouth.

767
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,280
Deputy, you have any idea what would happen to you

768
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,850
If I pulled this trigger?

769
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:01,450
He's got that lawyer ya'll hired in there too.

770
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,320
Get the deputy's keys and let everybody out Sarah.

771
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,390
Yes, sir.

772
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,070
Where's the sheriff?

773
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,670
Uh, he's at the state capitol,

774
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,700
meeting with the governor. Is that so?

775
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,270
I swear on my mama's eyes.

776
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,910
Deputy, you go over there and rip the radio out of that squad car.

777
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,020
Uh... Uh... I can't do that.

778
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,420
No, that there's a new radio. The sheriff would kill me if I did that.

779
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,660
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

780
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,880
Oh, shit!

781
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,520
Do all the telephone calls in town go through those two boxes over there?

782
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,920
They sure do.

783
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,940
Holy shit!

784
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,390
My car! My goddamn car!

785
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,730
Oh... Shit!

786
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,820
Sarah, give me that gun belt.

787
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,160
You, come here.

788
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,300
Come on.

789
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,930
Now, strip.

790
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,770
Go on. Strip.

791
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,540
Shit.

792
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,790
Don't let this take all day.

793
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,220
Here, Sarah.

794
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,860
Handcuff him to that post over there.

795
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,500
Go on. Go!

796
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,250
Sergeant, can I go with you?

797
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,760
I can't stay here no more.

798
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,490
Jump on.

799
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,960
Yeah!

800
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,080
Let's go.

801
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,190
Okay, now. You stay there.

802
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,690
Close the hatch.

803
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,130
What are you doing?

804
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,840
You're crazy!

805
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,670
Lie down, Billy, I'm coming to get you.

806
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,610
Lie down.

807
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,540
Damn it, lie down!

808
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,060
You're crazy! You're gonna get us all killed!

809
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,160
Ooh!

810
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,130
Yea! All right! Yea!

811
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,100
Hooray! Okay! Yea!

812
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,350
Well, where is this invading army we're supposed to stop?

813
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,060
Holy shit!

814
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,880
Well I sure would like to help you, but...

815
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,950
Governor, I have got a 52 year old sergeant that's crazy.

816
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,220
I got a 16 year old dope fiend, and a 20 year old hooker

817
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,520
in a Sherman tank!

818
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,820
They've already destroyed three squad cars,

819
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,030
Two trucks, my office, and a '74 Chevy!

820
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,000
I want you to call out the national guard,

821
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,430
and blow that son of a bitch away!

822
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,300
Well, I suppose I could do that, but that would take a lot of time.

823
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,940
Why don't you see what the army can do for you old buddy.

824
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,510
...and in Clemmonsville today,

825
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:56,040
in what has to be the most unusual prison break in recent history,

826
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,610
Sergeant major Zack Carey of Ft Clemmons, broke his son William out

827
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,350
of the Clemmons county correctional facility,

828
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,420
using a WWII Sherman tank.

829
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,140
All right. Thank you, son.

830
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,140
What's your big plan Sergeant Major?

831
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,310
We're gonna head for the Tennessee state line,

832
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:33,450
it'll take a couple of days over back roads and broken country.

833
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
We can move pretty good, it'll slow them down a tad.

834
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,850
What's she doing here?

835
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,290
Bill.

836
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,360
Look, once you get across the state line,

837
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,890
If they want you, they have to extradite you, we can fight that.

838
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:49,030
That means a fair hearing in a court of law, not what you got back there in Clemmonsville.

839
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,230
What's she? My lawyer, or something?

840
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,200
At that hearing, Sarah will testify,

841
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,510
that she was busted for vagrancy and forced into prostitution,

842
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,180
and then you and I can tell our side of the story.

843
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:01,980
You think they're going to believe our side of the story over a sheriff's?

844
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:07,120
Bill....that sheriff is not part of the system.

845
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:12,090
In a fair hearing, a lawyer can work. He can do his job

846
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
We're not running away from the law.

847
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,260
We're running to the law, Bill.

848
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,360
We're gonna win.

849
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,430
They're gonna lose, general!

850
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,500
They're going down in flames, and you're going to help me do it.

851
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:27,440
I just got back from the governors office. I can have him call you, or he can call your superior.

852
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:32,280
Either way, I want to see some tanks rolling out of here to stop that maniac.

853
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,250
Go ahead, call anyone you like sheriff. I don't take orders from governors.

854
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,420
Sergeant major Carey's resigned.

855
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:41,690
Besides, he's committed no crime in my jurisdiction.

856
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:44,460
He stole a goddamn tank! It's his tank, he can do what he wants with it.

857
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,190
The most I've got him on was busting a 20ft section of fence.

858
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,460
General, I'm the local civilian authority,

859
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,600
and I'm hereby making a formal request of the military,

860
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,670
to do everything in its power to assist me in apprehending...

861
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,310
Posse comitatus, sheriff.

862
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,110
Did you call me a pussy communist?

863
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:08,280
The U.S. army is,

864
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,280
by an act of congress' posse comitatus act,

865
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,650
is specifically precluded from enforcing civilian law,

866
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,060
outside the military reservation.

867
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:16,890
Pussy communist?

868
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:22,600
That means I do not have the authority to provide you with a single piece of military equipment or personnel,

869
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,830
without a direct order from my superior, or the President of the United States.

870
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,200
I can give you his address if you like.

871
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:34,270
Sheriff Cyrus Buelton, the chief law enforcement officer of Clemmons County,

872
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,110
has deputized an additional 200 men

873
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,610
in an attempt to apprehend the tank

874
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,150
before it reaches the Tennessee state line.

875
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,720
Which is apparently it's destination,

876
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:45,590
According to a C.B. broadcast made by Sergeant Carey from the tank today.

877
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,260
Now...

878
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,730
A tank is not what you want to call

879
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,660
A fuel-efficient vehicle.

880
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,200
I mean the son of a bitch ain't driving a Toyota!

881
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,240
Any fool knows it ain't far to empty on a sherman tank,

882
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,670
so I'm putting one of you brave boys

883
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,680
In every filling station between here and the state line.

884
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,250
He pulls in for gas he's gonna have to get out and pump it himself.

885
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,720
When that happens, it's gonna be my great pleasure,

886
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,890
to shoot that Sergeant in his privates.

887
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,880
Who's that out there?

888
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,160
Alright, don't make any noise.

889
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,460
I don't want to hurt you.

890
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,760
All I need is some gas.

891
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,370
Okay?

892
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,370
You the one they talking about on television with that tank and all?

893
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,210
Maybe.

894
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,180
Ya know, my sister had a boy down on that farm.

895
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,580
He never did come back. You're welcome to anything you need.

896
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,800
All right, Mr. Gant.

897
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,540
That ought to do her.

898
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,870
I don't know how to say thank you, sir.

899
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,540
And thank your wife for the chicken too, it's real good.

900
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,110
Oh, you're welcome, ma'am.

901
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,050
Best of luck to you sergeant.

902
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,580
Thank you.

903
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,660
Sergeant, now my wife, she's a church-going woman.

904
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:30,690
She's praying for y'all.

905
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,690
That's nice, Mr. Gant, thank you.

906
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,410
Alright, you guys, finish eating.

907
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,180
I got a few things to square up on the tank, then we're going to move out.

908
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,950
Now, I would like to say a few words about Mr. gant.

909
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:59,320
He has aided and abetted escaped felons.

910
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,590
Normally of course, I would arrest him,

911
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,960
but I can't do that,

912
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,500
because those same felons did destroy my jail.

913
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,300
However...

914
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,270
Long about tonight,

915
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:15,410
I'll bet Mr. Gant would be wishin he was in a nice safe jail,

916
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,440
especially if I suspect, some of his fellow citizens show up,

917
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,450
to express negative feedback,

918
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,450
on account of his helping escaped convicts,

919
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,390
dope addicts, and prostitutes.

920
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Isn't what you're saying an invitation to violence?

921
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:33,590
Violence don't need an invitation from me.

922
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,630
.....and that from sheriff Cyrus Buelton,

923
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:38,730
chief law enforcement officer of Clemmons County.

924
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,570
Meanwhile, the manhunt for the tank continues.

925
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,940
This is Ken billings in the TV-9 skywatch chopper.

926
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,970
In the middle of our morning traffic report, we were able to obtain these exclusive pictures of the tank itself.

927
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,940
In a short time however, we were spotted,

928
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:54,410
And the tank managed to disappear into the dense wooded area of this part of the county.

929
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,950
You would think that a Sherman tank would be an easy thing to spot,

930
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,850
but you've got to give the Sergeant Major credit, when he doesn't want to be seen,

931
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,760
he evidently will not be seen.

932
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
There you are, Jim. Billy.

933
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,670
We got them spotted right here sheriff.

934
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,700
He's headed through that thicket country,

935
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,700
then down into them bogs.

936
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,010
He's heading for the bogs boys.

937
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,240
Looks like we got us a possum hunt!

938
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,010
If that possum doubles back up on the road,

939
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,450
ain't nobody will give him any gas.

940
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,650
Not after what's going to happen tonight!

941
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,260
My wife and kids is gone!

942
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,500
You want to try and burn me out?

943
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,770
You go to it!

944
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,600
I'll tell you one thing,

945
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,870
I'll take out two of you with me!

946
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,510
This is the tank. You assholes better move!

947
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,590
Thanks, Mr. gant. You're welcome, honey,

948
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,530
ya'll just help yourself to anything you need now, ya hear me?

949
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,970
Billy, here. Take this.

950
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,650
Billy, I know how you feel about me, and maybe you're right.

951
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,890
but I just wanted you to know nothing happened between your father and me.

952
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,660
We sat at the bar, that's all.

953
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,860
Looks like that was enough.

954
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:51,760
Nothing happened because of him. He just wanted to talk, that's all.

955
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,630
If he hadn't been there in the first place, none of this would have happened.

956
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,640
And maybe if he took me out back,

957
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,640
nothing would've happened either.

958
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:04,010
If he would've been like any other guy with $20 in his hand and wanted to cheat on his wife,

959
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,980
that would've been the end of it too.

960
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,880
You should hate him for not taking me back there in the first place,

961
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,420
or hate me for not being sexy enough to get him there.

962
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,560
You can think of many reasons to hate,

963
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:22,960
but your father deserves better than that.

964
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,610
That's where the sheriff thinks you are right now down in them bogs.

965
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,680
That's where we would've been.

966
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,610
You'd have been stuck too.

967
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,910
He's got 10 mack trucks blocking the road.

968
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,580
How we gonna get around them?

969
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,790
See that holler, right there? That'll take you out.

970
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,590
That's stump country, but that won't hurt that thing you drivin'.

971
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,880
They're not in the bogs sheriff.

972
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:08,980
They must've doubled back on us.

973
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:14,880
That pussy communist.

974
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:23,560
Hold on, you two.

975
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:25,230
We're going for a rough ride.

976
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:55,530
Wouldn't that just frost them?

977
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,860
What is it?

978
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,900
I do believe we threw a track.

979
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,110
Billy, start up the tank.

980
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,110
When Sarah tells you to, inch it forward.

981
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,750
All right.

982
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,660
Sarah, get back here.

983
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:26,330
When I say it's okay,

984
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,000
tell Billy to move it forward. Right.

985
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:35,530
Damn it!

986
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,010
All right...

987
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,170
Okay!

988
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,840
No!

989
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,750
Billy, hurry! He's hurt!

990
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,620
I think I've broken some ribs.

991
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,590
Don't move, dad. Oh, it's my fault.

992
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:57,130
No, it isn't.

993
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,300
Billy, get the first aid kit out of the tank.

994
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,570
Sarah, put this stuff back in the tank.

995
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,890
I'm getting a doctor. You're coughing up blood.

996
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,090
No Billy, look. You two set out on foot.

997
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,100
Just get me off to the side, I'll be alright. I'm not leaving.

998
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:36,330
Billy, look, it's like a war,

999
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,830
you have to lick your wounds after the battle...

1000
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,340
Horseshit dad, I'm not leaving you.

1001
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:43,710
Billy I'm not asking you, I'm ordering you.

1002
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:48,680
You order soldiers. I'm your son. I'm getting a doctor.

1003
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:52,050
No, Billy. Look, the sheriff will get all of us.

1004
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:56,290
We don't have any choice. Then we're all getting out of here.

1005
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,360
I can drive this tank as good as you.

1006
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,130
I'll get us across that state line.

1007
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:09,030
Billy, you don't have to prove anything to me.

1008
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,940
I'm not proving anything.

1009
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:15,940
That's you and Johnny.

1010
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,040
I'm like mom.

1011
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,380
Practical.

1012
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,850
I love you...

1013
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:26,150
More than anyone on earth.

1014
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,790
Can you understand that?

1015
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,720
You put your life on the line for me,

1016
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:34,230
for something that wasn't even your fault.

1017
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,760
Now you can lean on me for awhile.

1018
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,100
I love you, son.

1019
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,240
I just want you safe. That's all.

1020
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:51,550
I know.

1021
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,480
Let's get on with it.

1022
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,750
Let's get going.

1023
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:04,090
You okay?

1024
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,800
You sure you can run this thing?

1025
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:12,830
He helped build it. You better believe he can drive it.

1026
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,240
Yeah but we're not going to do this hide by day, move by night routine.

1027
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,940
We're going up on the main road and haul flat out.

1028
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,970
See that cracker try and stop a tank.

1029
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,470
This Morning 16-year-old William Carey broadcast an S.O.S. from the tank

1030
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,740
Seems his father was injured fixing a thrown track,

1031
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:54,110
and William requested first aid instructions.

1032
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,380
In the meantime, what has since been dubbed as the battle of Gant's farm,

1033
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,080
The tank and it's unlikely crew are fast becoming folk heroes, for the entire nation.

1034
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,120
Especially to school children.

1035
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,960
Local high school children are holding up signs

1036
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,960
that read, "right on, tank.", and "go sarge, go"

1037
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:11,990
And what does sheriff Buelton have to say about this?

1038
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:14,230
Let me say first, these men are criminals.

1039
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,100
We're talking about an escaped convict

1040
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:20,240
And a man who is wanted for assault with a deadly weapon

1041
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,440
And a known... Excuse the expression...

1042
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:24,410
Prostitute.

1043
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,310
These people in that tank are not heroes.

1044
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:28,450
But they do have a tank.

1045
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,550
Well you read your bible, "might does not make right. "

1046
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:35,150
That boy made a serious mistake,

1047
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,590
when he came back up on this road.

1048
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,420
Now, we're gonna stop him.

1049
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,960
We know where, when, and how we're gonna do it.

1050
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,600
This is Ft. Clemmons to the tank, do you copy?

1051
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,900
We have Mrs. Carey on the line.

1052
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:50,900
How bad's he hurt?

1053
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,270
Billy? Billy?!

1054
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:56,310
You have to release the button to hear him.

1055
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,280
Mom, he's got some internal bleeding.

1056
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,570
You tell your dad...

1057
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:06,910
You tell him I'm sorry for the stuff I said.

1058
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,950
And I love him.

1059
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,050
And I love you.

1060
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,090
You're a pretty good old broad there mom.

1061
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,690
Don't you die on me, you son of a bitch.

1062
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,030
Don't you dare die on me.

1063
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:33,110
This is Jason Price speaking to you from the Tennessee Georgia state line,

1064
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:36,540
where a crowd of hundreds are gathered with more arriving every minute.

1065
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,110
At what will be the finish line,

1066
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:42,480
of the most bizarre race ever run in this part of the United States.

1067
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,380
If the tank can make it this far.

1068
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:49,390
We're here live with Mrs. Ladonna Carey,

1069
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:51,260
at the Tennessee state capitol.

1070
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,260
What reasons did the governor give for not seeing you?

1071
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,060
The governor said he couldn't spare five minutes of his time.

1072
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,900
What are you going to do about the situation?

1073
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:04,440
I would like to ask that every woman who can hear me,

1074
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,010
try to imagine that it were her son and husband out there,

1075
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:10,010
and phone the governor's office,

1076
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:12,210
ask him to spare five minutes,

1077
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,580
just five minutes,

1078
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:17,280
to a woman who's trying to save her family's lives.

1079
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,120
I'm going to stay right here until he does.

1080
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,900
State capitol.

1081
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:29,110
State capitol.

1082
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:31,910
Yes, he'll get the message.

1083
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,040
State capitol.

1084
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,610
300 calls so far.

1085
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:38,820
Who needs this shit?

1086
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:41,590
I say yes, I'm harboring an escaped convict.

1087
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:44,890
I say no, then I just shot Jesse James.

1088
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,590
Who needs it?

1089
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,460
Yeah?

1090
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,870
Do whatever you have to do. And keep me advised.

1091
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,470
State troopers office.

1092
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,540
They reckon 1,000 people have gathered on our side of the state line.

1093
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,410
Senators don't have to deal with this kinda shit!

1094
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,180
Get ahold of that Carey woman, tell her I'll meet with her.

1095
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,880
Billy! Billy Carey!

1096
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,490
This is Ken Billings of WGAZ-TV 9.

1097
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,460
We're flying right above you. Do you read me?

1098
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,590
Loud and clear.

1099
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,760
How's it going Billy? How's your dad?

1100
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,630
Not too hot.

1101
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,530
He's got some internal bleeding.

1102
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,540
Do you think he'll be able to make it across the state line?

1103
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,810
You better believe it, we'll make it across.

1104
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,080
What will you do then Billy? Will you surrender to the sheriff?

1105
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:39,810
No way! There's no way I'm going to let the sheriff take my dad.

1106
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,020
That's some kid. That's some old man.

1107
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,650
If he wants to make this the last stand at the alamo, then that's what we'll do,

1108
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:47,490
because we've got a load of firepower.

1109
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,760
We're going to get to the law. The real law.

1110
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:53,090
For a long time, like every other kid my age,

1111
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:55,530
I thought my dad was wrong about alot of things,

1112
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,970
but not anymore.

1113
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,870
He doesn't have to prove anything to me, and I don't have to prove anything to him.

1114
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,770
The bottom line is, he's my father and I love him.

1115
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,180
If that sheriff tries to hurt my old man,

1116
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,940
I'll blow him away.

1117
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,860
That little shit's running for governor.

1118
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,430
Mrs. Carey I have a good deal of sympathy for your plight,

1119
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:20,970
but this is a very delicate matter.

1120
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:23,440
All I'm asking is that they get a fair hearing,

1121
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:25,570
before you hand them back to someone like Buelton.

1122
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:30,480
It's not quite that simple. There are other considerations.

1123
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,480
What considerations?

1124
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,580
This is a very church-conscious state Mrs. Carey

1125
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,220
I'm talking about a Christian act of justice.

1126
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,450
In all candor Mrs. Carey, I'd find it very difficult,

1127
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,320
to put the full prestige and honor of the governorship,

1128
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,330
behind a crusade led by two men in a tank,

1129
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:48,530
With a 20-year-old prostitute.

1130
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,170
Governor, that's my husband and son,

1131
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,070
in that tank with that 20 year old prostitute.

1132
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,540
If I don't have a problem with that, I fail to see why you should.

1133
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:02,010
Perhaps we look at it from different perspectives.

1134
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,380
Well, my perspective has about a dozen reporters,

1135
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:10,150
from every TV, radio station, and newspaper you can think of,

1136
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,050
waiting for me to come outside and make a statement.

1137
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,460
Now, I'm either going to tell them,

1138
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:18,190
that they have a governor they can be proud of,

1139
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:20,460
who's willing to see that justice is done,

1140
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,060
No more, no less.

1141
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:25,570
Or I'm going to tell them their governor is an asshole!

1142
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,300
Which is it going to be?

1143
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,770
Are you threatening the governor of this state with blackmail Mrs. Carey?

1144
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,410
Yes, sir, I am!

1145
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,650
Euclid!

1146
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:57,490
Euclid!

1147
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,820
Euclid, will you come here?

1148
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,120
Yes, sir.

1149
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,830
Where's that fella Avery?

1150
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,800
He's coming right in now, sir. Come on.

1151
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,170
You Avery?

1152
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,900
Yes, sir.

1153
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:12,600
Hell sheriff, where did you get that?

1154
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,270
Sheriff Bucks loaned it to me.

1155
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:18,580
He had the thing up on his wall.

1156
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:20,580
Now they tell me you can shoot this. Is that right?

1157
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,150
Hell, that's all I did in the Army.

1158
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:24,750
Alright, now here's the plan.

1159
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,590
The tank is gonna be coming up this road.

1160
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:31,060
He is gonna see those trucks, he can't get over them.

1161
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,930
So he's gonna have to veer off this road,

1162
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,360
out into this field,

1163
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,900
and when that happens, he's gonna get stuck in the mud.

1164
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,830
That's what's gonna happen, all right.

1165
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,070
That's what I said!

1166
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,100
When that happens,

1167
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:47,140
I want you to fire to immobilize the tank.

1168
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,270
I don't care if he can still shoot.

1169
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,680
but I don't want him to be able to move, ya hear me?

1170
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,780
Piece of cake, sheriff.

1171
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,380
Hit him in the track, blow that track.

1172
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,520
That'll stop him for sure.

1173
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,390
Governor, have you talked to Mrs. Carey yet?

1174
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,120
Yes, we have.

1175
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:03,690
Have you made a decision yet?

1176
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,660
Yes, we have made a decision.

1177
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:08,030
If Mrs. Carey's husband and son reach our jurisdiction,

1178
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,030
a full and complete hearing will take place,

1179
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,030
in which we'll examine all the facts of this entire affair,

1180
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:16,010
before any request for extradition is granted.

1181
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:17,370
Where is Mrs. Carey?

1182
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:21,010
Mrs. Carey is on her way to the state line,

1183
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,280
where I hope to join her within the hour.

1184
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:27,810
Hang in there, dad. I think we're home free now.

1185
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,910
The governor will fight the extradition.

1186
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:58,250
Zack, Billy, you've won!

1187
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:20,040
All right! We are ready!

1188
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,310
Euclid, get them water trucks out of here.

1189
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:26,480
Everybody else, get behind this dirt ramp.

1190
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:37,320
They got the road blocked with trucks.

1191
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,690
I'm going around.

1192
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,550
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1193
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:00,980
Go! Go!

1194
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:03,620
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1195
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,670
Hold him there.

1196
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,400
Hold him.

1197
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,840
Now get him!

1198
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,640
That's all right, that's all right.

1199
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:29,540
Don't be nervous, squeeze the trigger.

1200
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:32,050
But if you miss again, it's your ass!

1201
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,850
Just keep going, son.

1202
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,060
We did it! We got him!

1203
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,530
I'm as happy as a pig in shit!

1204
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,900
Maybe you ain't a faggot after all.

1205
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,870
All right out there, the game is over.

1206
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,540
Come out and surrender.

1207
01:35:58,880 --> 01:35:59,880
No!

1208
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,540
Drop on it, sheriff.

1209
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,550
Get down, boys! Down!

1210
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:18,530
Now that betrays a negative attitude, Billy boy.

1211
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:20,460
But that's all right.

1212
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:23,010
Me and my boys got all the time in the world,

1213
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:25,730
and we can wait.

1214
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,480
Fire away, Billy boy.

1215
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,080
We got a long day ahead of us.

1216
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:40,980
So you just sit there in that tank and enjoy the afternoon sun.

1217
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,760
Move those people back.

1218
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:52,260
Isn't there anything they can do?

1219
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:55,930
They've got no engine, they can't move. They gotta be pulled out.

1220
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:14,580
Hey what are you guys doing here?

1221
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,080
Stealin'.

1222
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:29,500
When it gets dark,

1223
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,600
I want the two of you to go out through the hatch,

1224
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:34,870
and slip across the line.

1225
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,610
I'm not gonna let you die.

1226
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,580
I'm staying with you.

1227
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,810
Bill...

1228
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,180
Sheriff.

1229
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,880
If I surrender now,

1230
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:48,890
will you get medical attention to my father?

1231
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:53,560
I hear you, Billy.

1232
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:56,260
Yes, sir. You give up now,

1233
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:58,890
I'll see your daddy gets straight to the hospital.

1234
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:01,930
You got the word of sheriff Buelton on that.

1235
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,850
What the hell is that?

1236
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,820
Cover me.

1237
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:54,760
Shoot that hippie son of a bitch!

1238
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,090
Let the governor through. Let him through.

1239
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:46,120
Good old son of a bitch!

1240
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,020
Goddamn!

1241
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:59,900
Pull! Everybody, pull!

1242
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,930
Pull! Pull it! Pull!

1243
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:08,980
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

1244
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,220
Stop them bastards, shoot into that crowd!

1245
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:32,960
You shoot into this crowd, and we'll turn this into another little big horn Buelton.

1246
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,730
Stop them out there!

1247
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:34,970
Come on out of here!

1248
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,780
Grab that cable! Haul that cable in!

1249
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:53,890
Pull! Pull!

1250
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,030
Come on, governor! Pull!

1251
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,840
We've got to try something else.

1252
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,610
Follow me.

1253
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:28,790
Get those tables out of the way!

1254
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,060
Come on get em out. Move it!

1255
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

1256
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Come out of that tank or I'll burn you out!

1257
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,400
I'll fry you alive! You hear me?

1258
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:42,170
I'll pour gasoline down that hatch,

1259
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,740
'Cause you have lost, sergeant, and I won!

1260
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:49,710
Hook her up. Hook her up!

1261
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,020
We stopped a sherman tank!

1262
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:55,090
We didn't get no help from the governor, army...

1263
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:09,900
Pull! Pull!

1264
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:30,860
I'm coming, sheriff!

1265
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,910
Sheriff...

1266
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:51,210
You syphilitic bolshevik!

1267
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:52,780
You pervert!

1268
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:54,250
You pussy communist!

1269
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,850
Pull! Pull! Come on!

1270
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,750
Pull! Pull!

1271
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:04,120
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

1272
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:02,480
You did real good, old girl.
