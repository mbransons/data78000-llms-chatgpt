1
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:45,624
All right, all right. Get back now.
Get back. Get over there.

2
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,708
All right, hold on, you little animals.
I'm coming now.

3
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,109
It's cold out there, ain't it?

4
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,342
All right, come on.
Get through those doors.

5
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,150
Oh, come on. Move it. Move it.
Come on, get off it. Hey!

6
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:39,543
Danny, check this out, man.
Piece of cake.

7
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:46,825
- ... either one of these schools...
- Sit down.

8
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:47,893
...you can go to...
- Mr. Rubell!

9
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,793
- What happened?
- We've got another one.

10
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,024
Stab wound.

11
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,898
- Who stabbed you?
- I don't know.

12
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,904
Of course.
Call an ambulance.

13
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,473
I don't want no ambulance.

14
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:03,542
It's not for you,
it's for the insurance company.

15
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,577
Send an ambulance
to JFK, please.

16
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:07,771
Oh, would you call
the nurse, please.

17
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,483
- Mr. Rubell. - Just a moment.
I'll be right with you.

18
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,714
Oh, Ms. Hammond,
what can I do for you today?

19
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,692
- Do you know that kid
is bleeding? - Yes, I do.

20
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:27,999
- Well. This is for you, Mr. Rubell.
- What's that?

21
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,695
It's a notice informing you we'll
be holding depositions here.

22
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:34,499
If your teachers can't remember
to bring their records with them,

23
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:35,868
we'll come to the records.

24
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:39,068
- We want to start tomorrow.
- Fine.

25
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,908
Is that student bleeding?

26
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,744
- Yes. We're taking care of it.
- Good. Good.

27
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,286
Oh, Principal Horn,
this is Lisa Hammond

28
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:52,016
of Kemel, Keating and Hess,
attorneys at law.

29
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,218
How do you do?

30
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:56,556
Her firm is handling
the Calvin case.

31
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,424
- What?
- John Calvin. Suing the school.

32
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:05,398
Oh, yes.

33
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,566
Well, Ms. Hammond,
I think you'll find that we're

34
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:11,574
trying to cooperate fully
with you in this matter.

35
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,666
Mr. Horn, our client
is suing the school

36
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:16,611
because he graduated
but he can't read or write.

37
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:21,242
I should think all of us would be
cooperating to help clear this up.

38
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,549
Mr. Rubell?

39
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,990
- Mr. Rubell!
- Yes.

40
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:33,086
We have at least 10% of our
teachers absent again today,

41
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:36,063
and we're having
trouble finding subs.

42
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,327
Scrape the bottom of the barrel
if you have to, Grace, please.

43
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:42,167
- Mr. Rubell, I'm going to need...
- Is Jurel in yet?

44
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:43,365
On a Monday?

45
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:13,524
Hello?

46
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:18,340
Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Wensel from Kennedy.
Are we coming in today?

47
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,568
Or are we taking another of our
famous three-day weekends?

48
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:22,944
No.

49
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,246
What time is it?

50
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:29,682
<i>It is 7:45, We are already
10 minutes late, Mr, Jurel,</i>

51
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:32,421
Well?

52
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,982
Well, what?

53
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:36,925
Are you going to
teach today?

54
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,961
Yeah,
I'll be in very soon.

55
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,532
<i>Oh, why, thank you,
Mr, Jurel,</i>

56
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,260
<i>It's so nice of you to
take into consideration</i>

57
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:49,030
<i>the trouble you cause
other people by your...</i>

58
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,936
I thought you said you
were an airline pilot?

59
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,469
I am.

60
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,340
Didn't I just hear that lady say
something about teaching?

61
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,385
Yeah, well, I gotta go teach
a class on cabin pressure.

62
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:05,612
Oh.

63
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:09,019
You know, oxygen masks.
Things like that.

64
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:13,357
Do you want some coffee?

65
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:16,225
- Sure. You want some help?
- No. No.

66
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:21,969
Coffee's brown, right?

67
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,366
How do you like it?
Black or burned?

68
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,575
Look, I'm really running late here.
Maybe I'd better skip the coffee.

69
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,016
Yeah, that'd be my move.

70
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,118
Yeah.

71
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:45,286
- Call me sometime.
- Yeah. Sure.

72
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,669
Mr. Rubell, I have a list
of the teachers

73
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:00,763
- that I would like to meet with tomorrow.
- Must have the time down.

74
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:03,604
- It's important that we start... - Lee,
would you do this for me, pal, please.

75
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,076
None of you seems to take
this lawsuit very seriously.

76
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,012
And you, Ms. Hammond,
take things too seriously.

77
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,311
That was your problem when
you were a student here.

78
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,447
- And it's your problem now.
- And you were a rotten English teacher.

79
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:17,887
I know.

80
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,691
Do you know that kid's bleeding?
You should report that.

81
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:32,568
- Well? - Well, not to me.
I'm here to give a lecture.

82
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:35,505
How thrilling.
Auditorium across the hall.

83
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:43,343
You are always hogging
that machine.

84
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,848
Of course.

85
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,818
Every day. Day in and day out
you are on that machine.

86
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,355
I have been trying to use
that machine for three weeks,

87
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,051
and every time I try,
you're here.

88
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,890
Well, today is my day.

89
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:00,693
I want to use that machine.
I need that machine.

90
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,290
That machine needs me.

91
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:06,371
- I fail to see any reason for your...
- Oh, you fail to see?

92
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,599
You fail to see?

93
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:13,167
Can you see this?
You son of a bitch!

94
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:18,243
- Oh, my God.
- Today is my day! My day!

95
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,374
- Ms. Bloom, in control.
- My day.

96
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,783
- You control yourself. This is a school.
- My day. My day.

97
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:22,876
Grace, hold up.

98
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:24,785
- Ms. Bloom! Ms. Bloom!
- My day! My day!

99
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,518
Please control yourself.
This is a school. Ms. Bloom!

100
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:31,561
- Ms. Bloom, please, control yourself.
- Put her on the floor.

101
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,223
Ms. Bloom, stop it.

102
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,800
- Nurse!
- Come on, now. Nurse, help, help.

103
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:42,267
Ms. Bloom, calm down.

104
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:43,806
Who is that?

105
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:46,706
School psychologist.

106
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,775
Must apologize for the heat.

107
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,683
This hallway is the warmest part
of the whole building.

108
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,881
Most of the tenants just
leave their doors open,

109
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,753
so you can get the heat.

110
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,952
We're a real friendly building here,
you know.

111
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:10,066
Are you sure he's safe? I mean,
he isn't dangerous or anything, is he?

112
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:13,762
No. I assure you, there will be
no problems with Mr. Gower.

113
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,804
He's completely harmless.

114
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,636
He merely has a few problems
with reality, that's all.

115
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,676
Oh, this place would be just
marvelous for Herbert.

116
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,407
It's only four blocks
from the hospital.

117
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,881
Yeah, well,
the apartment's upstairs.

118
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:38,387
- Yes?
- Hello, Mr. Stuart Van Ark?

119
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,629
Yes.

120
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,896
Mr. Van Ark, this is Mrs. Wensel
from Kennedy High.

121
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,836
<i>We want you to come in and substitute
one of our history classes,</i>

122
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,603
<i>It may be for several days,
Can you make it?</i>

123
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,006
Yes.

124
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,338
She poured ink, ink,
all over Ditto.

125
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,908
Oh, God, I'd have given anything
to have been there to see that.

126
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,011
Can you just imagine his face?

127
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,749
I tell you, Alex, it's never dull
around here on Mondays.

128
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,555
- Oh, you ought to...
- Excuse me?

129
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,425
Could you tell me where
I might find room 127?

130
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:20,025
Yup. Just go back, go down the steps,
turn right and it's right around the corner.

131
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,000
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,066
Well, back to the trenches.

133
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,240
My God, it's a stampede.

134
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:31,039
Where are you going?
I thought you didn't like school!

135
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,036
Move it!
Now!

136
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,151
Hey, Timmy, if you're not running
for President, sit down.

137
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,224
All right, will you?

138
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,025
All right.
If you're not here, speak up.

139
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:57,236
All right, boys and girls!
Ladies and gentlemen.

140
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,034
Today we're gonna delve

141
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,137
into the fascinating world
of radiator repair.

142
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:11,048
Oh, we're supposed to be learning
about social studies, not radiators.

143
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,177
Learning is limitless, Tim.

144
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,434
Hold it down, please.

145
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:40,570
Hold it down.

146
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,080
Paller?

147
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,483
- Paller?
- Here!

148
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,148
Look, just raise your hand.
That's all I need.

149
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,386
Please, can you keep it down?
Please!

150
00:11:56,495 --> 00:12:01,558
Frame? Please. Not those pants.
Not again. All right.

151
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,329
Hold it down. Please, please.
Hold it down.

152
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,895
Henson? Henson?
How are you, Henson?

153
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,534
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

154
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,471
- Alvado?
- Alvedo!

155
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:16,549
What?

156
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,346
Yesterday you said
it was Alvado.

157
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,444
No, I didn't, Mr. Rosenberg.

158
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,615
Yes, you did. And the day
before it was Alverus.

159
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,352
No, I didn't!

160
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,621
You're trying to get me
into trouble, man.

161
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,555
What's so funny?
I don't find anything funny.

162
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:42,432
Aren't you going to
take attendance?

163
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,638
Attendance?

164
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:47,202
Oh, yes.

165
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:51,142
Sarah, I asked for a wrench,
not a screwdriver.

166
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,852
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:58,047
- Which is it?
- It's by your right hand.

168
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,854
Your other right hand.

169
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:05,157
Thank you.

170
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,577
No calculators, Ms. Mason.

171
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:27,651
A "B" becomes a "C,"
remember, with a calculator.

172
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:28,843
What is this, summer camp?

173
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,615
Please, please.
Everybody has their own paper.

174
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,682
Come on, Danny, you forgot
to carry over...

175
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,163
All right, everybody.
Stay put.

176
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:43,630
Please!
Please let me go!

177
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:46,498
Somebody, please!
Somebody!

178
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,664
Alex!
Alex!

179
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,471
Get him off me!

180
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:59,780
Get him off me!

181
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:04,617
Get him off me!
Get him off me!

182
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,383
He's crazy. He's crazy!

183
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,127
Dues are not being
paid here, people.

184
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:16,096
Let's try and bring those
delinquent ones up to date,

185
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,497
or we're gonna have
to take action.

186
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:23,036
A union cannot be run on
just good intentions alone.

187
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,700
We need cold hard cash.

188
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:32,180
I want you to know that as your
union rep, I'm on top of this.

189
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,272
They want us here at 7:35.

190
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:37,784
We're gonna hold fir
until we get 7:38.

191
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:42,016
Now, these are our three minutes
and we will get it.

192
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,785
And if we were a
private school

193
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:48,125
then we wouldn't have to depend
on a bond issue for our salary.

194
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,858
How do you spell tardiness?

195
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:52,526
L - a - t - e.

196
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:56,332
Now, about this
court-case thing.

197
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,872
Well, all I know is that now they're
gonna take depositions here.

198
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:07,039
So, we have to change
our strategy on that point.

199
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,138
What strategy?

200
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,742
Remember,
whatever they don't find out

201
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,146
can't hurt us.

202
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,190
- Did anybody really vote
for this guy? - I know.

203
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,418
Alex, please,
I wanna hear this.

204
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,154
I don't care what anybody
else says about this,

205
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:24,060
we're gonna stick together
with the union.

206
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,835
I get the feeling I
interrupted something.

207
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,775
Just Malloy,
addressing the Reichstag.

208
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:42,540
Oh, say, Alex. Remember this student
you once had about 10 or 12 years ago?

209
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:46,586
- Her name is Lisa Hammond.
- Lisa Hammond?

210
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,145
Oh, yeah. Bright kid.
Great ass.

211
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,986
Yes.
Well, nothing's changed.

212
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:55,221
Really?
She's here?

213
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,296
Yeah.

214
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:01,596
But get this, she's working for the law
firm that's handling the Calvin case.

215
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:05,433
She's taking depositions here.
Starting tomorrow.

216
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,666
In fact, she's taking your deposition
in two and a half weeks.

217
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:11,300
I knew we should
have flunked her.

218
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,075
You know what
you're gonna say?

219
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,846
You're not gonna betray old JFK,
are you?

220
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:25,357
Oh, come on, for Christ's sake, Roger.
That'd be like shitting on the Peace Corps.

221
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:30,220
You haven't lived till you see them
try to serve me with a subpoena.

222
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:34,158
- Oh, here.
- What's this?

223
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:37,327
Well, I tell you, Alex. You heard about
Ditto and Theresa Bloom, right?

224
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,338
- Yeah, which version?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,739
With our psychologist on temporary
leave and no money to replace her,

226
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:46,175
I gotta have somebody to take over
the counseling chores.

227
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,543
Me? Why me?

228
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:50,411
- Because you're sensitive.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

229
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:51,848
- You're compassionate.
- Bullshit, Roger.

230
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,316
- You're caring.
- Bullshit.

231
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,352
You've got a free period.

232
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:57,820
Well, so does everybody
else in here.

233
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,015
And the teachers in
the next period

234
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,024
are gonna have a free period too,
for Christ's sake.

235
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:04,562
And they'll be drafted too.

236
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:07,131
Alex, we have a lot of misunderstood
youth in this place.

237
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,633
Now, everybody's got to pitch in.
Starting with you.

238
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,671
- How many kids is this?
- One.

239
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:16,206
- One?
- Name's Eddie Pilikian.

240
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,332
He and his parents
are gonna be

241
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:19,535
at the counseling office
in about 10 minutes.

242
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:21,840
- All right.
- Now, I know you'll do well.

243
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,972
- One kid?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:25,205
All right.

245
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:30,087
Sit. Right there.
Right there.

246
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,882
Oh, Mr. Rubell!

247
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:38,258
Superintendent Burke is in the
conference room with Principal Horn.

248
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:41,320
Great.

249
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,658
I mean, just what the hell
are you guys running here,

250
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,565
a goddamn zoo?

251
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,501
I'm in the middle of a
fund-raising breakfast

252
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:50,403
and I'm informed that
your school psychologist

253
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,875
has flipped out in the middle
of your goddamn office.

254
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,503
And then I get here and I find
out there has been a stabbing.

255
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,741
And if that's not enough,
one of your kids

256
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,874
tries to eat one of your
goddamn teachers.

257
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:03,976
Mr. Rubell, what the
hell do you call that?

258
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,054
Monday.

259
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:09,554
Look, Dr. Burke, whatever happens here,
I'm taking care of it.

260
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,992
Are you also taking care
of the lawsuit here, too?

261
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,690
You do know we're
being sued, don't you?

262
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,825
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, you do? Good for you!

263
00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:21,564
- Dr. Burke, I don't think you really...
- I know. I know.

264
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:24,268
I...

265
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,872
I understand your problem, all right?

266
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:32,471
But you sure as hell
better understand mine!

267
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:36,382
I am fighting for our
survival out there.

268
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:41,082
We cannot let the things that happened
here today circulate around the city.

269
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,058
We have got to
control the publicity.

270
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,721
Or else this community
is gonna lose faith in us

271
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:50,128
and we won't get the new
bond issue passed

272
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,996
and that means no money.

273
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:56,697
No money means no school.

274
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,574
Do I make myself clear?

275
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:02,201
Absolutely.

276
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,448
All right, I've asked Alan Lewis,
our attorney, to be here

277
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,383
to help us on this matter.

278
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:15,287
First of all, I wanna know who
is on our team,

279
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,291
and I wanna know who is
going to rock the boat.

280
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:21,260
And most importantly,

281
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:25,663
we all have to agree on what's to
be said at these depositions.

282
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,701
Well, very well.

283
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:32,072
What would you like me to do?

284
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:35,040
Well, I have taken the liberty

285
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:39,705
of having your secretary pull the file
of the remaining teachers involved.

286
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,911
I would like to go over them.

287
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:52,683
All right. The first one
is Kenneth Stiles.

288
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:57,323
No. Stiles has no problem.
School line all the way.

289
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,594
Then of course there's Principal
Horn and myself.

290
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:04,194
Yes, of course. What's that one?

291
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,706
Alex Jurel, social studies.

292
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:12,644
Yeah, Alex.
I don't see any problem there.

293
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,147
Oh, really?
"1969, started free school.

294
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,377
"Strong advocate of students' rights.

295
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,249
"Reading program canceled in 1974
due to lack of funds.

296
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:25,086
"Excellent leadership qualities. "
This sounds like trouble to me.

297
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,422
No. No, that was
over 10 years ago.

298
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:31,588
Alex and I did all those things
when we started. Now look at me.

299
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,865
No, Alex is all right now.

300
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:39,133
Why, hell, if they hold a deposition on
a Monday, he might not even show up.

301
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,071
Mr. and Mrs. Pilikian.
Alex Jurel.

302
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,481
No, I'm Jeffrey Propes,
Mrs. Pilikian's attorney.

303
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,917
Oh, really?

304
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,955
Oh, what did he do this time?

305
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,124
No, I'm here in regards to
Mrs. Pilikian's recent divorce.

306
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,321
Oh, okay. I see.

307
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,228
Eddie, would you wait outside.

308
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,770
Mr. Jurel, Mrs. Pilikian has just
been through a very trying...

309
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,071
Excuse me, one minute.

310
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,048
Well, as you can see here
in regards to custody,

311
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,142
Mrs. Pilikian enjoys full rights...

312
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,552
Mr. Pilikian will of course
be allowed to see Eddie

313
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,852
under certain conditions and
with Mrs. Pilikian's approval.

314
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,860
Excuse me, one minute.
Why are you telling me this?

315
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,793
Because we want
to make it clear

316
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,162
that Eddie's father is not to
see him during school hours

317
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,134
nor is he to attempt to pick
Eddie up from school.

318
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:49,230
Mrs. Pilikian, I'm sorry you have problems,
but we're here to talk about Eddie.

319
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,536
He's been kicked out
of his third class.

320
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:55,044
He reads at a sixth-grade level
and he's majoring in detention.

321
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,944
Now, don't you think that's just
a little bit more important?

322
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,917
It's very important to Mrs. Pilikian
that we first settle this custody problem.

323
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,421
Now, she hasn't been able to function
in full capacity since the divorce.

324
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:09,186
I think we've
said our piece.

325
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,232
Mrs. Pilikian, don't you care
about your son's education?

326
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,800
Isn't that your job, Mr. Jurel?

327
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,812
Eddie.
Come on in here.

328
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,053
Eddie, in.

329
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,182
Sit down.

330
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:50,857
- Read that.
- Do what?

331
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,562
Just open it up anyplace
and just start reading.

332
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,914
Out loud.

333
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:16,018
- I don't like this magazine.
- What kind of magazine do you like?

334
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:18,287
Come on, just lay off.
I don't need this.

335
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:21,592
What you need, Eddie, is another
remedial reading class again.

336
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:23,325
You're not fooling anybody.

337
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,866
Hey, I passed that class.
You can't make me take it again.

338
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:29,301
I read fine. So don't you worry
about it, okay? Just lay off.

339
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:32,206
All right.

340
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:36,541
But you just got kicked out
of your social studies class.

341
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:38,773
So, I'll give you a choice,

342
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:42,977
you can take my class or
you can take study hall.

343
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,549
I'll take a study hall.

344
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:51,592
Yeah, my class. Third period.
I'll see you there tomorrow.

345
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:54,055
That's all.

346
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,404
Now, don't blow on me.

347
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:07,041
I can make it.
I can make it.

348
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:10,271
No, I can't.
Are we here?

349
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:13,108
- We're here.
- See, I told you I could make it.

350
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:17,607
What do you want?
Hey!

351
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:22,020
What was that?
What was that?

352
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,052
What do you want?

353
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,620
I'll have a Grasshopper.

354
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,191
- No, make it a Pink Lady.
- All right.

355
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:34,393
And put in it some fruit
and Tabasco sauce.

356
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:37,402
And some of those
little sesame seeds.

357
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:38,869
Oh and don't forget
the umbrella.

358
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:41,806
Hold the umbrella,
open it up and put in the drink.

359
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,314
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

360
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,484
Too much vermouth.

361
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,519
Too much vermouth.

362
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:08,899
I sense tension here.
What's the matter, Alex?

363
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:12,901
Oh, it's getting to me, Rog.

364
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,475
It's supposed to,
that's why it costs so much.

365
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:18,101
No, not the booze.

366
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,612
The school.
The bullshit.

367
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,277
The bullshit.

368
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,645
Of course, the bullshit.

369
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,715
Hey, I know.
Let's go be...

370
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,022
Let's be cowboys.

371
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,686
- Yeah, yeah. Cowboys!
- Yeah...

372
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,092
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What?

373
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:40,029
- I'm afraid of horses.
- You pussy.

374
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,068
I'm afraid of them too.

375
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:51,070
I'm just getting tired
of the whole damn thing.

376
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,144
Like that Pilikian thing.

377
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,645
You knew that lawyer was gonna be
with that mother, you knew that.

378
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:57,648
Oh, come on. Is that what's
been bothering you?

379
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,187
Pilikian? Oh, forget about Pilikian.
Pilikian is a lost cause.

380
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:05,451
Oh, yeah.
It's getting too easy to forget.

381
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,788
There's too many Pilikians
in that school.

382
00:26:08,894 --> 00:26:13,092
Hey, hey, we do good.
Lots of them learn.

383
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,928
Lots of those kids learn.
They learn good.

384
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:22,201
We are not the bad guys.
We do good with what we've got.

385
00:26:26,912 --> 00:26:29,039
- What we got sucks.
- You know it.

386
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,686
So, what are you gonna do?

387
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,480
Quit.

388
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,523
Just quit.

389
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:47,087
Hey, now listen to me.
You've been a teacher for 14 years.

390
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,598
- Fifteen.
- That's what I said.

391
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,565
- Oh. - And you're a
fucking great teacher.

392
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:53,899
- Was! I was a fucking great teacher.
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

393
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:57,770
Without us, there's nothing.
Nothing.

394
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:02,167
We're the last stand
of civilization.

395
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,712
If we fail, anarchy.

396
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,278
"Anarchy. "

397
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,280
- Or worse...
- "Worse. "

398
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:11,684
- A baby boom.
- "A baby boom. "

399
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:14,758
What do you think those little monsters
would be doing if they weren't in school?

400
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:15,826
I don't know.

401
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,894
- Fucking, fucking like fucking
little rabbits. - Fucking?

402
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,088
We've got to stop them.

403
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:24,065
- You mean, I'm a contraceptive?
- Yes, and one of the best.

404
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:29,570
I'm an old fucking rubber.

405
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,671
I'm going to bed.
You wanna stay over?

406
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,181
No, no, no. I can drive.

407
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,513
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Absolutely.

408
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,152
Mr. Jurel!

409
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:30,798
Mr. Jurel,
I would like a word with you.

410
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:34,198
Well, make it a quiet one, Gracie.
I've had a hard day.

411
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:37,204
School hasn't even started yet.

412
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,738
All right, what do you want?

413
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:44,108
You cannot put Eddie Pilikian,
a lower-level student,

414
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:48,774
into your third-period social-studies class,
an upper-level class.

415
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:51,351
Sure, I can, Gracie.
I've got tenure.

416
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:53,386
It's not school policy

417
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:56,820
and if you would read the curriculum
circulars you would know that.

418
00:28:56,924 --> 00:29:00,655
But then you never read the
curriculum circulars, do you?

419
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:06,530
Mr. Jurel, at least have the decency
to fill out the proper paperwork.

420
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,728
- Okay.
- Thank you.

421
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,662
Alex, you seen this yet?

422
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:17,209
Looks great. I've been meaning
to get one of those myself, Carl.

423
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:33,255
Mr. Jurel!

424
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:34,851
Shit!

425
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,096
Hi.

426
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:41,195
Lisa Hammond.

427
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,641
Okay.

428
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:02,017
Holy shit, lady.

429
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:03,180
God damn it.

430
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,190
- Mr. Jurel.
- Lisa, are you nuts?

431
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,919
This is the boys' bathroom.

432
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:11,225
Yeah, I know. Well, I've always
wondered what one looked like.

433
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:14,061
- No big deal.
- I'm taking a leak.

434
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,600
I wanted to talk to you.

435
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:17,363
Well, call me on the phone,
for Christ's sake.

436
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,732
This is the boys' bathroom.

437
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:22,068
Oh, come on, Mr. Jurel,
I have two brothers, for crying out loud.

438
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:25,166
Well, I don't.
Do you mind?

439
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:36,282
- Here, dry your hands.
- Thank you.

440
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:42,753
Oh, fuck!

441
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,258
Hi.

442
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:50,267
That was cute, real cute.

443
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:54,062
It really is good to
see you, Mr. Jurel.

444
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:59,068
Considering how much you've seen,
why don't you call me Alex?

445
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:10,310
God, the room seems
so different.

446
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,516
I guess nothing's the
way you remember it.

447
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:22,259
You're mad, aren't you?

448
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:28,197
You really take your job seriously,
don't you?

449
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:30,001
That's what you taught me.

450
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,303
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

451
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:38,473
- The Calvin case.
- I try to stay out of political things.

452
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,279
I have a hard enough
time just teaching.

453
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:43,411
"Political"?

454
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:47,355
Alex, this case is about teaching.
It could mean a great deal to education.

455
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:51,054
I mean, a boy goes all the way
through a school system

456
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:55,996
and gets passing grades and a diploma
and still can't read or write.

457
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:59,330
This boy was one of your students and
he can't even fill out a job application.

458
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:01,461
Don't you think there's
something wrong with that?

459
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,129
You were one of my students

460
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,902
and you can fill out
a whole subpoena.

461
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:15,742
You know,
I had a terrible crush on you.

462
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:16,840
Who didn't?

463
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,383
Listen, I'm really sorry about what I did.
Let me make it up to you.

464
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,981
Let me buy you dinner.

465
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:25,823
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

466
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,830
What do you say?
Talk about old times and all that.

467
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,165
Okay.
Where?

468
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,398
How about my place, 7:30?

469
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:40,339
- Does your bathroom
have a lock? - Two.

470
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:41,603
Good.

471
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,379
Okay.
Good.

472
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:50,752
See you tonight.

473
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,752
Love the shirt.

474
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,122
Great ass.

475
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:06,400
Hold it.
Let me see your pass.

476
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:09,994
- Okay.
- Thanks.

477
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:27,354
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Troy?
- Yeah, come on in.

478
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,693
Present here are Lisa Hammond,
counsel for the plaintiff,

479
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,357
Alan Lewis, counsel
for the defendant

480
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:42,232
and Eugene Horn, principal of
John F. Kennedy High School.

481
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:47,408
Have you ever given a
deposition before, Mr. Horn?

482
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:48,941
No.

483
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:51,510
Well, it's very simple. I'm just
going to ask you some questions

484
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,139
and you're under oath, so I'd like for you
to answer them as fully as you can.

485
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,544
- Okay.
- Good.

486
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:02,452
Did you have a student here
at JFK named John Calvin?

487
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:05,855
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

488
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,897
Ms. Hammond, there are 2300
students here at Kennedy every year.

489
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,830
I don't know all of them.

490
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:18,694
- Wouldn't your records
show enrollment? - Yes.

491
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:21,970
Okay,
where are your records?

492
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:25,468
I don't know.

493
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,778
Fuck you!

494
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,644
Fuck you!

495
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,384
Move it! Coming through!
Move it! Move it!

496
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:40,652
Move it!

497
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:44,926
Look out.
What the hell is going on here?

498
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:48,932
No problem. There's no problem.
He just slipped, okay? He's fine.

499
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:51,333
- I'm fine. Fine.
- He's fine. No problem.

500
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,596
- Hey, you okay? All right.
- I'm fine.

501
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:56,766
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm fine.

502
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,770
Fucking Paller.

503
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:02,040
- Fucking Paller.
- Oh, excuse me.

504
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:04,412
I didn't do shit to him.

505
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:13,420
- Eddie, you got to get me a piece.
- A piece of what?

506
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,124
That's very funny, Eddie.
Very funny.

507
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:21,326
Next time I see that asshole I want
to have something on my side.

508
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,561
No, forget it, okay?
You let me handle Paller, all right?

509
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:26,326
Okay.

510
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:29,239
- Thanks, Eddie. Thanks.
- Forget it. Forget it, will you?

511
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:30,467
Okay. Thanks.

512
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,702
Okay, I'm taking off.
You want to come?

513
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:34,506
Sure, yeah.
Sure.

514
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:37,340
- Hey, wait...
- Shit!

515
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,110
What're we gonna do now?

516
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,214
Hey, trust me.
Come here.

517
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,417
- Come on, will you.
- Okay. All right.

518
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,845
Can you believe this shit?

519
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:25,596
If John Calvin was a student here at JFK,
would his name appear on these records?

520
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:28,798
Yes, it should.

521
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,362
Good. Now, who's in
charge of the records?

522
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,833
I don't know.

523
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:43,740
Nice touch.

524
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:47,246
What touch?
I really don't know.

525
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,045
That's the fire alarm.

526
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:56,690
Move it out, quickly.
To the right! To the right!

527
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,084
Hey! Hey, you two! Come here.
I want to talk to you. Hey!

528
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:33,819
You're in big trouble.

529
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,910
- Get in. Come on!
- No.

530
00:37:58,653 --> 00:37:59,642
We can't do this, Eddie.

531
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:02,552
Haven't I taken care of things
since third grade?

532
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,271
Have we got balls or what?

533
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,403
This is fucking great.

534
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,908
Give me five.

535
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:42,895
So, that's how I passed
the bar exam.

536
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:49,326
So, whatever happened to Mrs. Jurel?

537
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:51,564
I wanted to be a teacher

538
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:55,038
and she wanted something more
than my teacher salary could provide.

539
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:58,338
Food, clothing, shelter.

540
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,309
So there hasn't been
anybody else?

541
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,614
No, not really.

542
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,650
What about you?

543
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:11,817
Oh, hundreds.

544
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:15,018
I'm a lawyer after all.

545
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:20,192
So, you haven't told
me what you think.

546
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,892
Oh, the meal was great.

547
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:23,565
No, I'm not talking
about the dinner.

548
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,503
I know the dinner was great.
I got an "A" in home ec.

549
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:29,105
- I'm talking about the case.
- What case?

550
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,637
Oh, that's how we're
gonna play it?

551
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,045
I'm serious. I really want
to know what you think.

552
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,542
Why is it so important what
I think about your case?

553
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:45,082
Because the other teachers
will follow what you do.

554
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,317
You're one of the leaders
of that school.

555
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,792
Boy, Lisa, you've been
gone a long time.

556
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,597
Yeah, I guess I have,

557
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,190
because JFK is nothing
like I remember it.

558
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:58,894
- Maybe you have a selective memory.
- Oh, come on.

559
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:01,438
In the two days that I've been
there I've seen a stabbing,

560
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,135
a teacher attack another teacher,
a student bite a teacher,

561
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,439
a fire alarm that looked
like Hiroshima.

562
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:09,514
It's not a school anymore,
it's a loony bin.

563
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,107
- Oh, Lord, here comes another subpoena.
- What's that supposed to mean?

564
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:15,083
- What?
- That crack.

565
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,885
What's the matter? You afraid I might
do more for education than you?

566
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,686
Education? Are you nuts?

567
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:23,686
Lisa, your lawsuit isn't
about education.

568
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:25,693
It's about money.

569
00:40:27,765 --> 00:40:30,359
Nobody really cares if
that kid didn't learn.

570
00:40:31,903 --> 00:40:34,167
They just wanna make
some major bucks.

571
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:35,905
Oh, great.
Just what we need.

572
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,999
Words of wisdom from a guy
who hides out in bathrooms.

573
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:44,638
You know, Lisa, there's nothing worse
than a female lawyer with a cause.

574
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,841
Except a male teacher
without one.

575
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:50,678
Is it so hard for you to admit
that something's wrong there?

576
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,050
Oh, hell, Lisa.
Come on!

577
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:54,681
Do you think you're telling
me something here?

578
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:58,084
I've been there day in and
day out for 15 years.

579
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:00,060
Don't even think you can try.

580
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:02,332
Listen.

581
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:07,402
I counseled a kid named Eddie Pilikian
the other day and it was a waste of time.

582
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:09,131
I can't reach this kid.

583
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,041
The parents and the system,
they've so fucked up this kid

584
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,508
that I don't know.

585
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,943
I don't think I'm ever gonna
be able to reach him.

586
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,811
Yes, you will.

587
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,987
You'll reach him.
You'll make a difference.

588
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,187
You did with me.

589
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:37,596
Look, it's not right for a lawyer
to be discussing a case

590
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,396
with someone she's gonna be
deposing in two weeks, is it?

591
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:44,337
No. But I didn't ask you
here as an attorney.

592
00:41:45,742 --> 00:41:46,902
Why did you?

593
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,955
I think I better
check the dessert.

594
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:10,989
What do you mean, what am
I gonna say at my deposition?

595
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,497
I'm gonna say the same
as everyone else.

596
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:15,536
Oh, Carl, just forget it.

597
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:17,730
Easy for you to say.
You forget it!

598
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,798
I'm telling you that Reese
kid has gotta go!

599
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,001
He's trying to drive
me crazy.

600
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:25,238
First he attacks me,
now he's trying to drive me nuts.

601
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:27,371
- I want him out!
- Will you calm down?

602
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:30,212
Yeah, Alex,
I had Eddie Pilikian.

603
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,310
The kid had about
a sixth-grade reading level.

604
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:33,911
He couldn't do the work.

605
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:36,116
I didn't know what
to do with him.

606
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:39,156
How about teaching
him to read better?

607
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,827
Mr. Van Ark,
I am a social studies teacher.

608
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:45,057
It is not my job to
teach reading.

609
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,827
But you are a teacher.

610
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,868
Some people should have more
experience before they speak.

611
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:04,448
So, what are you gonna say
at your deposition, Ray?

612
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:07,279
What is this?
An inquisition?

613
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:08,513
- Carl, be reasonable.
- "Reasonable"?

614
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:10,021
Now, what do you want
me to do with him?

615
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:11,681
- I told you!
- I cannot expel him!

616
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:12,759
Why not?

617
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,327
Because the courts will not allow us
to violate that poor child's rights.

618
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,453
What about my rights?

619
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,758
And a juvenile hall will just
send him right back here.

620
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:21,857
Nobody would want us to let
that kid loose on society.

621
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:23,831
Then put him in his class.

622
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:27,163
Oh, it's fine with me.

623
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:30,776
- I'll handle him.
- You'd bore him to death.

624
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:33,777
What's that supposed
to mean?

625
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,883
What do you think
it means, Ditto?

626
00:43:37,984 --> 00:43:41,078
Your class is boring.
Your students don't learn a thing.

627
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:44,618
If it weren't for tenure,
you'd be selling vacuum cleaners.

628
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:46,291
Have I left anything out?

629
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,986
I don't have to take
that from you.

630
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:54,698
I have received three consecutive teaching
awards for the most orderly class.

631
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:02,397
Three consecutive
teaching awards

632
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:05,136
for the most orderly class.

633
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:07,678
And what do you think
about that, mister?

634
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,973
Gee, Ditto,
your shit don't stink.

635
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:23,156
And how was your date last night
with Ms. Hammond, Alex?

636
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,682
Reese, where the
hell is my desk?

637
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,222
Reese,
where the hell is my desk?

638
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,449
Reese!

639
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,458
All right.

640
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:42,301
Let's talk about the responsibility
a school has to its community.

641
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,768
Aren't we going over
our homework questions?

642
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,638
We'll do that later.
Let's talk about this first.

643
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:51,207
Does a school have a responsibility
to its community?

644
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:52,440
Babysitter.

645
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:54,951
All right, babysitter.
That's right. Yeah.

646
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,280
Anything else?

647
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:00,581
You were supposed to
be here yesterday.

648
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,728
Mrs. Wensel says I ain't even
supposed to be in this class.

649
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,256
Yo, me neither.

650
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,654
No one knows where you're
supposed to be at, Terry.

651
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:13,499
It's all right. I'll take care of it.
Take a seat.

652
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,370
So, what other responsibilities
does a school have to its community?

653
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:30,578
Where did you leave off?

654
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,418
Pickett's Charge.

655
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:54,962
"Four score and
seven years ago,

656
00:47:56,537 --> 00:47:59,904
"our fathers brought forth
on this continent

657
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,272
"a new nation,

658
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:05,567
"conceived in liberty

659
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:09,337
"and dedicated to
the proposition

660
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,886
"that all men are created equal. "

661
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:31,065
All right, all right.
Forget community.

662
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,865
Let's just talk about you.

663
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,072
Let's talk about us.

664
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:37,869
You in school,
what does school do for you?

665
00:48:37,977 --> 00:48:39,342
- Nothing!
- Nothing?

666
00:48:40,246 --> 00:48:42,714
It gives you a diploma
so you can get a job.

667
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:44,314
Then it does something.

668
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:46,885
School is just a place where
teachers make money.

669
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:48,010
Yeah, sure.

670
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,146
I got a yacht in the Caribbean.
All right?

671
00:48:51,256 --> 00:48:52,450
Lot of money.

672
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:56,422
- Does school round out
your knowledge? - No.

673
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:58,696
Why?

674
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:01,732
They teach you all this junk
like who was Hiawatha.

675
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:04,498
I don't care who she was.

676
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:07,801
They never teach you what
you want to know, right?

677
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,935
Hiawatha was a man, Tim.

678
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:13,577
You see what I mean?
Who cares?

679
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:16,545
I think we know what's better for us
more than the teachers do, you know.

680
00:49:16,648 --> 00:49:17,637
- Right.
- Right.

681
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:18,875
Tell them about it, Diane.

682
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:20,952
I think school does
a good job.

683
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:22,278
Oh, shit.

684
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:25,279
It makes us better people
if we learn this.

685
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:33,219
Mr. Pilikian, was that
just a large breakfast?

686
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,564
Or do you disagree
with this man?

687
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:42,406
Well?

688
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:44,898
Come on.
This place is a joke.

689
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:46,738
What do you mean,
it's a joke?

690
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:50,473
You're being sued by some kid
'cause you didn't teach him nothing.

691
00:49:52,683 --> 00:49:55,516
What're you gonna say when
they ask you about that?

692
00:49:59,422 --> 00:50:00,753
All right. Fine.

693
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:07,187
Mr. Pilikian has just given us
another assignment.

694
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:08,320
Say what?

695
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:10,092
Oh, man!

696
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:11,293
No, wait a minute.

697
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:15,361
You tell me. Tell me what's
wrong with this school.

698
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:18,307
You tell me what I should say.

699
00:50:19,243 --> 00:50:21,233
So, what? We gotta write
another paper now?

700
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,608
No, you don't gotta
write another paper.

701
00:50:23,713 --> 00:50:26,807
Just communicate your ideas.
I don't care how you do it.

702
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:30,519
You can write a paper if want or take
a photograph. Do it any way you want.

703
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,746
Sing a song.

704
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:33,448
Communicate.

705
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:34,723
Hold it.

706
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:38,859
How do we know if we do this
we're not gonna get in trouble?

707
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:40,053
You don't.

708
00:50:40,964 --> 00:50:42,329
But I'll guarantee it.

709
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,263
No getting us for
what we say?

710
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:46,527
No reprisals.

711
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,936
Yeah, no reprisals.

712
00:50:50,305 --> 00:50:51,363
All right.

713
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:45,724
All right.
One more, one more.

714
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,489
All right, you ready?

715
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,532
Okay. Great going.
Okay. And...

716
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:08,038
Boring!
Boring.

717
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:23,423
Teacher's lounge.

718
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,359
That's the girls' bathroom.

719
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:36,771
Eddie.
Eddie.

720
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,577
- All right.
- Eddie.

721
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:42,908
- Eddie.
- All right.

722
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:44,243
Way to go, Eddie.

723
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:46,686
No reprisals, right?

724
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:54,350
- Mrs. Wensel?
- Yes.

725
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,486
Dan Hall, Independent
Insurance Company.

726
00:52:56,596 --> 00:52:59,087
I'm here about the accident
involving the driver's ed car.

727
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:00,962
- Sounds good.
- Oh.

728
00:53:01,234 --> 00:53:03,167
We seem to have
misplaced it.

729
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:05,360
What?

730
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:09,299
How can you misplace a one-ton
piece of equipment?

731
00:53:09,942 --> 00:53:11,910
Are you kidding?
At this place?

732
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:19,275
What's up?

733
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,454
This.

734
00:53:27,058 --> 00:53:29,186
- Not too bad.
- Not too bad?

735
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:32,060
The kid rips off a camera
and takes these pictures

736
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:34,428
and all you can say is,
"Not too bad. "

737
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:38,567
The morning paper is
running these tomorrow.

738
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:41,773
I've been on the phone
with Dr. Burke all morning.

739
00:53:41,874 --> 00:53:44,240
- Do you want to know
how mad she is? - No.

740
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:47,741
He claims you okayed this.

741
00:53:49,013 --> 00:53:49,980
Did you?

742
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,028
Yes.

743
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,322
You can go.

744
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:09,664
Where the hell are
your brains?

745
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:11,825
You know how much embarrassment
this is gonna cause us?

746
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:13,368
Oh, come on, Roger.

747
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:17,735
It's not like that kid was chewing
bubble gum or something.

748
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:20,935
Look, this is the first time
I've gotten to this kid.

749
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:24,208
Maybe I can make him
give a shit about himself.

750
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:27,617
That's a hell of a lot more important
than a silly thing like this!

751
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:29,186
That's not your job!

752
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:32,045
So don't pull some of that
Mr. Chips crap with me!

753
00:54:32,357 --> 00:54:35,154
Your job is to get them through this
school and keep them out of trouble.

754
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:36,316
That's it!

755
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:40,421
Well, maybe I should
reexamine my job.

756
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,861
Maybe you should!

757
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,666
I don't know what's
happening to you, Alex.

758
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:51,263
But if you got a personal problem,
you work it out at home, not here.

759
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,837
This goes on your
permanent record.

760
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,947
Does that mean I have to
stay after school, too?

761
00:55:08,591 --> 00:55:11,060
Did you forget to tell
me about the paper?

762
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:13,794
Okay, Pilikian.

763
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:17,230
You miss my class one more time
I'll let them have your butt.

764
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:19,268
Deal?

765
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:22,297
It's a deal.

766
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:35,448
So, this is your idea
of a gourmet dinner, eh?

767
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:38,816
Well, you haven't lived until
you taste one of my tacos.

768
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:41,687
One taste and you're gonna agree,
I should've taught home ec

769
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,691
instead of Mrs. Badie.
Move your buns.

770
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,023
Wasn't Mrs. Badie...

771
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:48,095
Cut.

772
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,555
Wasn't Mrs. Badie having
an affair with Ditto?

773
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,261
Why, does that turn you on?

774
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:56,069
Compared to what?

775
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:05,380
To this.

776
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:36,467
Sure beats the
hell out of Ditto.

777
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,216
I had my...
My little talk with Ditto today.

778
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:46,582
Guy's still a jerk.

779
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:48,848
Why? Did he fall asleep while
you were asking questions?

780
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:51,255
We both fell asleep
during his answers.

781
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,087
It's really ticking me off.

782
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:57,292
I mean, I just don't understand.
I...

783
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,823
- Are you listening to me?
- No.

784
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:01,901
Cut.

785
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:05,535
I mean, I can understand Horn
and Rubell ducking my questions,

786
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,664
but I'm trying to
help the teachers

787
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:11,005
and all I'm getting is a lot of
"I don't knows" and "I can't remember. "

788
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:13,272
Wish I knew what
the hell was going on.

789
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,678
Lisa, are you gonna talk about this
all night, because I'm getting turned on.

790
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:19,546
You just don't understand
the frustration, Alex.

791
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:20,880
You wanna bet?

792
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,423
You don't get out much,
do you?

793
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:30,519
Lisa, can't you for one night just forget
about the case, the school and everything?

794
00:57:31,731 --> 00:57:32,959
For one night?

795
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:37,325
All right.
I'm sorry.

796
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,594
You're right.
We'll...

797
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:46,307
We'll just have a nice dinner and
relax and I won't say another word.

798
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:47,572
Great.

799
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:52,580
It's just, I can't understand
the teachers.

800
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:55,085
I mean, I'm trying to change
an inept system

801
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:56,984
and that can
only help them.

802
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,120
Lisa, who do you think
makes up this system?

803
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,454
The people do.

804
00:58:01,961 --> 00:58:03,689
And they don't wanna be
scapegoats for that system.

805
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:06,127
- I'm not on a witch hunt.
- Yes, you are.

806
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:09,799
What is that supposed
to mean?

807
00:58:10,502 --> 00:58:12,800
Everybody wants
to change it.

808
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:15,702
They all have ideas, but nobody
wants to pay the price.

809
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:18,037
Now, you're asking some teachers
to stick their necks out

810
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:20,509
and they know they're
gonna get chopped.

811
00:58:20,812 --> 00:58:23,576
You'll end up closing the school,
not changing it.

812
00:58:24,716 --> 00:58:27,149
You're not gonna tell
the truth, are you?

813
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:29,747
It won't change anything.

814
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,422
Oh, Lisa, look.

815
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:42,523
I remember a lot from your class,
Mr. Jurel.

816
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:45,730
About how you were supposed to
fight for what you believed in

817
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:47,236
no matter what it cost.

818
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,771
Was that all a lie?

819
00:58:48,973 --> 00:58:51,567
Were you just having fun
with a bunch of kids?

820
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,368
What about Eddie Pilikian?

821
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:57,345
Doesn't he mean anything
or was that just self pity?

822
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:00,950
I needed you, Alex.
I was counting on you.

823
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:02,846
And what about you, Lisa?

824
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,522
I haven't seen you
since I don't know when.

825
00:59:07,758 --> 00:59:09,885
All of a sudden we're going
out and having dinner.

826
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:11,756
Is that part of this fight?

827
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:15,325
- Is that what you think?
- What're you getting out of this?

828
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:17,957
Your name in the paper?

829
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:21,298
Just by being here I am
eopardizing my career,

830
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,999
but I couldn't stay away.

831
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:28,737
And now I can't even
remember why.

832
00:59:31,382 --> 00:59:32,644
I don't know how to
make you believe me.

833
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,979
I don't know if I even really care,
but I'll tell you this.

834
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:36,278
I'm gonna ask
the questions

835
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:38,650
and you're gonna have to
give me the answers.

836
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:40,985
I know what's going
on in that school

837
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:43,348
and I'm gonna change it
with or without you.

838
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:45,051
What the hell do you know, Lisa?

839
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,220
You're not a teacher,
you're a lawyer.

840
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,662
You can't see what's
going on in there.

841
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:53,026
You and those others, you come in the
school and you waltz down those hallways

842
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,967
and you think you can tell us
what's happening there?

843
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:56,629
Well, that's bullshit!

844
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,701
You can't see what's
happening there

845
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,901
because you're hiding behind
your memories and your ideals.

846
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:04,001
You use them like shields.

847
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,308
When you can drop
your shields

848
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:10,715
and walk down those halls naked
and really see what's happening

849
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,050
then talk to me and
I'll believe you.

850
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:20,496
Bye.

851
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:32,240
Hey!

852
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,433
Not bad.

853
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,306
Where did you
get this car?

854
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,406
What do you think?
A little paint, a little glue.

855
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:42,278
Where did you
get this car?

856
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:46,250
- Where did you get it?
- It's Rosenberg's.

857
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:49,252
What, are you fucking crazy?

858
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,858
What...
What's your problem?

859
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:54,359
You, you stupid asshole,
you don't go ripping a teacher's car.

860
01:00:54,462 --> 01:00:55,827
What, you want to go
back to juvie again?

861
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,761
- Get the hell off of me!
- No, you can't do this.

862
01:00:57,865 --> 01:00:59,162
You're gonna get caught.
Now, just take it back.

863
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:01,029
No way. I took this. It's mine.

864
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:03,070
No, no. Take it back.
Get rid of it, all right?

865
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,729
- Oh, I see. I see.
- Get rid of it.

866
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,798
Only the great Pilikian can steal a car,
anybody else does it, they're stupid.

867
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:11,241
- I'm not stupid!
- No, no, Danny, you don't understand.

868
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:13,404
Rosenberg is gonna have
the cops all over the place.

869
01:01:13,514 --> 01:01:14,606
Just take it back,
all right?

870
01:01:14,715 --> 01:01:18,811
No! Fuck you! You're so worried about it,
you fucking take it back.

871
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:20,011
Fuck you!

872
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,119
Oh, shit!

873
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:44,502
- Why do we have to read this book?
- Because I said to.

874
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:48,433
It's a good book. I just reread
it myself last summer.

875
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,132
You read in the summer?

876
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,994
What is the name of this river?

877
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:13,290
Potomac!

878
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:14,455
The Delaware!

879
01:03:14,565 --> 01:03:17,261
Delaware!
The Delaware!

880
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:22,098
Row!
Row!

881
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:24,169
Row!

882
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:47,327
What we're talking about here, literally,
is the future of the school.

883
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:52,157
They're gonna try to prove that John
Calvin was knowingly promoted

884
01:03:52,669 --> 01:03:54,864
when in fact he
should've failed.

885
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:57,298
Now as two of
his teachers

886
01:03:57,407 --> 01:04:00,399
you're going to be asked
questions pertaining to that.

887
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:03,512
Mr. Rosenberg,
your deposition is tomorrow.

888
01:04:04,814 --> 01:04:07,874
Mr. Jurel, yours is in four days.

889
01:04:07,984 --> 01:04:09,952
Carl, give it a rest, will you?

890
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,757
Now, I feel confident

891
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:19,521
that we have effectively stalled
their access to the school records.

892
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:21,933
However...

893
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:27,069
it would be most beneficial if neither
of you had any personal records.

894
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:31,298
Don't you wanna
know if it's true?

895
01:04:32,175 --> 01:04:33,164
Beg your pardon?

896
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:35,971
I said, "Don't you wanna
know if it's true?"

897
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:39,039
Isn't that the best
place to start?

898
01:04:40,382 --> 01:04:41,747
Not necessarily.

899
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,943
Alex, just stick to the discussion,
please.

900
01:04:44,053 --> 01:04:45,577
- Well, I am.
- No, no, no.

901
01:04:45,688 --> 01:04:49,124
I don't think the question here
is whether or not we're guilty.

902
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:52,491
No.
Innocence is irrelevant.

903
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:54,289
Oh, you mean we're guilty?

904
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:57,297
Let's not say that, okay?
Even if you're kidding.

905
01:04:57,399 --> 01:04:59,457
Let's just agree
not to say that.

906
01:04:59,901 --> 01:05:03,234
Oh, I see. I see.
Guilt isn't irrelevant.

907
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:04,965
I asked you not
to say that.

908
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:06,404
Look, Mr. Jurel,

909
01:05:07,342 --> 01:05:11,176
all we're trying to do here is to help
you better prepare your answers.

910
01:05:11,879 --> 01:05:15,178
We're not conducting some
great search for the truth.

911
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:16,644
Oh.

912
01:05:17,052 --> 01:05:20,782
Yes, now, let's stick to the discussion.
Carl, quit pacing, will you?

913
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:22,913
I'll pace if I want to, damn it!

914
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,957
God!
This place is unbelievable.

915
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:31,797
- I want my car back!
- What is he talking about?

916
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:34,367
Now, calm down.
Just calm down, Carl.

917
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:37,700
Calm down? Calm down?
That's what you said when I got bit.

918
01:05:37,805 --> 01:05:39,466
That's what you said
when they stole my desk.

919
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:42,941
I got a big flash for you, Roger.
It didn't work then and it won't work now.

920
01:05:43,044 --> 01:05:44,135
Calm, Carl.

921
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:46,209
And you people
are beautiful.

922
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:49,111
All of you just sitting here,
telling us how to lie.

923
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:51,081
- Don't say that!
- Come on, come on!

924
01:05:51,184 --> 01:05:52,811
That's what all of you people
are doing, aren't you?

925
01:05:52,919 --> 01:05:54,819
- Telling us how to lie!
- Mr. Rubell.

926
01:05:54,921 --> 01:05:56,855
I will not tolerate this
breakdown of teamwork.

927
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,323
Teamwork?
Teamwork, my ass!

928
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,451
I'll tell you what you can do
with your teamwork!

929
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:03,756
- Carl... Carl.
- Mr. Rubell...

930
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:07,128
- I got a lot to say. A lot to say!
- Don't say that!

931
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:10,032
You will sit down and you
will do what you are told

932
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,297
and that is all there is to it.

933
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:12,963
I will not sit down!
I'm not a child!

934
01:06:13,073 --> 01:06:14,700
You can't talk...
I'm not in kindergarten!

935
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:17,402
- Mr. Rubell!
- What?

936
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:20,277
I'm sorry, Grace,
what is it?

937
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:23,081
There is something
wrong with Mr. Stiles.

938
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:24,484
Who?

939
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:26,686
Ditto.

940
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:30,348
Move out now!

941
01:06:30,456 --> 01:06:31,855
Let's go!

942
01:06:31,957 --> 01:06:33,720
Move out!
Let them through!

943
01:06:34,427 --> 01:06:36,054
- Come on, let's go.
- Let them through.

944
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:37,629
Come on!
Move, move, move!

945
01:06:39,732 --> 01:06:42,200
- What the hell is this place?
- He's inside.

946
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:44,101
Down this way.
Let him through, now.

947
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:45,966
Let him through,
let him through.

948
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,441
- This guy's dead.
- Really?

949
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:53,170
How can you tell?

950
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,282
Hi, Eddie.

951
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,952
Hey, Diane, what's up?

952
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,262
I need some help.

953
01:07:55,073 --> 01:07:56,563
Do your parents know?

954
01:07:57,509 --> 01:08:00,273
You can't tell them,
Mr. Jurel, please.

955
01:08:01,813 --> 01:08:04,280
Eddie told me I could
trust you, you know.

956
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,009
Look, Diane...

957
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:11,986
- They should be told.
- No, Mr. Jurel.

958
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,648
My God, they'd kill me.

959
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,891
My father would throw me out.
My whole life would be over.

960
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,598
Please.

961
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,396
Which teacher is the father?

962
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:27,200
No, never mind.
I don't wanna know that.

963
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:37,736
What do you want to do?

964
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,582
Get an abortion.

965
01:08:44,021 --> 01:08:46,512
Well, there are other options.
You could...

966
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:50,023
You could have the baby
and put it up for adoption.

967
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,964
Will you take me, Mr. Jurel?

968
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:05,932
I can't.

969
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:09,802
Please.

970
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:18,480
I'll take you.

971
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:24,486
I'll take you.

972
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,825
Are you sure you're okay?

973
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,529
Yeah, I'm okay.

974
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,800
Listen,
can I bum a cigarette?

975
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:15,869
- Diane, look, I don't think...
- Mr. Jurel,

976
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:19,606
I just had an abortion.
I think I'm old enough to smoke.

977
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:25,145
Yeah.

978
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:26,918
Thanks.

979
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,091
Diane,

980
01:10:42,136 --> 01:10:44,569
you gotta try to
forget about it.

981
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:48,971
You know what
really gets to me?

982
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:54,077
What really gets
to me is that

983
01:10:55,114 --> 01:10:57,639
it just doesn't bother me,
you know?

984
01:10:59,619 --> 01:11:01,450
It doesn't bother me.

985
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:04,486
Why?

986
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:32,875
So?

987
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,615
You gotta be kidding me.

988
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:44,253
You know how many people
have been looking for this car?

989
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,266
You took it?

990
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:51,302
Hey, I never said that.

991
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,833
I'm just showing
you something.

992
01:11:53,938 --> 01:11:56,839
- Why? - Well, I figure this
makes us even now.

993
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,008
What?

994
01:11:58,109 --> 01:12:02,240
Well, you did something for me,
I'm doing something for you. We're even.

995
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:05,507
That's important to you?

996
01:12:06,485 --> 01:12:08,612
I don't owe people nothin'.

997
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:14,991
Hey, Eddie,

998
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,925
how about keeping the car
and taking the reading class?

999
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,122
Hey, we're even, man.

1000
01:12:21,232 --> 01:12:24,360
Oh, come on, Eddie,
knock off the dumb-talk crap.

1001
01:12:24,769 --> 01:12:28,830
You wanna act stupid in class,
that's fine by me, if that's your act.

1002
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,464
But we both know
you're not stupid.

1003
01:12:31,842 --> 01:12:33,707
So give me a break.

1004
01:12:34,578 --> 01:12:37,513
You're getting a chance here, Eddie,
take it.

1005
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:40,745
Sure beats the hell
out of stealing cars.

1006
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:43,442
Take the class.

1007
01:12:45,822 --> 01:12:48,723
Who you doing this for, me or you,
all this?

1008
01:12:53,097 --> 01:12:54,621
Does it matter?

1009
01:13:00,504 --> 01:13:03,529
All right, I'll take the class.
You can keep the car.

1010
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,733
Well, what the hell am I supposed
to do with it?

1011
01:13:05,842 --> 01:13:08,402
Just drive it up to
the principal's office?

1012
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:11,207
You're a teacher, man,
you'll think of something.

1013
01:13:11,314 --> 01:13:12,440
Smart.

1014
01:13:23,059 --> 01:13:24,617
You okay, Carl?

1015
01:13:24,761 --> 01:13:26,728
Fine, fine,
don't worry about me.

1016
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:29,992
Okay, Mr. Rosenberg,
you just follow my lead today.

1017
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:31,725
- I think everything will be...
- I know. I know. I know.

1018
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:35,133
You've gone over it a million times.
I know it by heart.

1019
01:13:35,237 --> 01:13:38,206
I'll be okay. Don't worry about it.
I'll do the right thing. I will.

1020
01:13:38,307 --> 01:13:40,970
- Okay, good man.
- Okay. Let's do it.

1021
01:13:48,617 --> 01:13:51,017
Was John Calvin a
student of yours?

1022
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:52,643
Absolutely.

1023
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:57,018
Did John Calvin pass the
required course in your class?

1024
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:01,493
I don't think Mr. Rosenberg could
answer that question as put.

1025
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,825
It's rather vague.

1026
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:10,036
Okay, did John Calvin receive
a passing grade in your class?

1027
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,897
Yes.

1028
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,136
Did he deserve it?

1029
01:14:15,676 --> 01:14:17,701
I don't think Mr. Rosenberg
can answer that question

1030
01:14:17,812 --> 01:14:21,043
until he fully understands
what the question means.

1031
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,079
Did John Calvin complete
the work required

1032
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:29,850
to enable him to receive a
passing grade in your class?

1033
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,916
- Once again...
- Oh, shut the hell up!

1034
01:14:33,028 --> 01:14:34,858
Just shut the hell up!

1035
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,360
John Calvin didn't deserve
any grade in my class,

1036
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:41,196
because he rarely, if ever,
bothered to show up.

1037
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:43,770
I had nothing to
base my grade on.

1038
01:14:43,905 --> 01:14:45,964
Then why did
you pass him?

1039
01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:49,600
Because it's policy.

1040
01:14:58,485 --> 01:15:00,385
I'm sure we can clear
this whole thing up.

1041
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:01,920
- It's like he's retarded.
- Yes, I know.

1042
01:15:02,022 --> 01:15:04,923
I demand to know why
you are flunking my son.

1043
01:15:05,058 --> 01:15:06,047
What?

1044
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,753
How can you flunk him when
he's already passed the class?

1045
01:15:08,862 --> 01:15:11,888
Wait a minute, Mrs. Pilikian,
now, I'm not flunking your son.

1046
01:15:11,998 --> 01:15:15,229
The problem here is your getting Eddie
to take over the reading class

1047
01:15:15,335 --> 01:15:16,597
that he's already taken.

1048
01:15:16,703 --> 01:15:18,000
He's already passed.

1049
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:19,594
- Who's Jurel?
- I am.

1050
01:15:19,706 --> 01:15:22,334
He's not supposed to be here. You know that.
I told you I can handle this.

1051
01:15:22,442 --> 01:15:23,670
- He's my son, too.
- Wait a minute.

1052
01:15:23,777 --> 01:15:25,244
- What's going on here?
- Are you trying to flunk my boy?

1053
01:15:25,345 --> 01:15:27,870
Mr. Rubell said that he doesn't have
to take the reading class again.

1054
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,449
Well, wait a minute, if he doesn't have
to take the course again, why...

1055
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:33,110
You're not supposed to be here.
He is not supposed to be here.

1056
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:34,880
- He needs that class.
- I asked you a question, Jurel.

1057
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:37,218
Alex, he's already
passed the class.

1058
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,121
- Look, I've got a...
- Will you just shut up.

1059
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:41,989
Hey, why don't you all just
shut up for a minute, all right?

1060
01:15:44,797 --> 01:15:47,061
You don't talk to me like that.

1061
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:49,962
Fuck off.

1062
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:54,503
- Come on, come on, come on.
- He's my kid, Jurel, I'll handle him.

1063
01:15:54,607 --> 01:15:56,074
You're doing a hell
of a job, pal.

1064
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:57,938
If you screw around with
my kid again, I'll be back.

1065
01:15:58,043 --> 01:16:00,910
That's not gonna solve anything.
Now, please.

1066
01:16:01,013 --> 01:16:02,241
Let go.

1067
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:05,314
Mr. Pilikian, please.

1068
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:06,611
Please.

1069
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:19,893
What are we gonna do?

1070
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:21,933
You heard him. Drop it.

1071
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:24,696
- He can't read.
- He can read enough.

1072
01:16:24,803 --> 01:16:27,135
Enough? What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

1073
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:29,673
God damn it, Alex, what the hell
do you want me to do?

1074
01:16:29,774 --> 01:16:33,039
I am not wasting what little time
and money I've got on one kid.

1075
01:16:33,144 --> 01:16:36,875
For every Eddie Pilikian, there are 50,
100 kids who learn here and learn well.

1076
01:16:36,981 --> 01:16:38,812
Now, we're not here to
worry about one kid.

1077
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:42,477
We're here to get as many of these kids
through the system with what we've got.

1078
01:16:42,587 --> 01:16:45,181
Now, that's reality,
and you know it.

1079
01:16:45,456 --> 01:16:48,220
- You can't see it, Roger, can you?
- See what?

1080
01:16:48,326 --> 01:16:50,294
This is the same thing
we're being sued about.

1081
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:52,795
Don't talk to me about being sued, Alex.
I don't wanna hear that.

1082
01:16:52,896 --> 01:16:55,797
This is the reason Lisa Hammond's
down the hall taking depositions.

1083
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:58,333
- We're not teaching these kids.
- I can't hear you, Alex.

1084
01:16:58,435 --> 01:16:59,959
- We're not teaching these kids.
- I can't hear you.

1085
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,938
- We're doing it again!
- I can't hear you!

1086
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:19,621
- One second.
- Violators...

1087
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:22,157
All these names, numbers don't match up.
They're not even close.

1088
01:17:22,259 --> 01:17:23,624
But I wasn't the
only one there.

1089
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,957
Superintendent Burke, please.

1090
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:27,621
Anything wrong?

1091
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:30,429
Rosenberg fucked us.

1092
01:17:32,602 --> 01:17:33,864
What?

1093
01:17:34,504 --> 01:17:36,369
He told everything.

1094
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:40,341
How could you let
that happen?

1095
01:17:40,443 --> 01:17:43,276
There wasn't anything I could do
about it, Roger.

1096
01:17:43,379 --> 01:17:45,347
Oh, God damn it!

1097
01:17:51,587 --> 01:17:53,783
You can't even
control Rosenberg?

1098
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,827
You know,
this puts it in your boy's lap.

1099
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:02,061
If Jurel confirms this
in his deposition,

1100
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:03,897
we're sunk.

1101
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:07,135
Donna, hold on.

1102
01:18:19,482 --> 01:18:21,313
Donna, this is Roger.

1103
01:18:22,218 --> 01:18:24,152
We've gotta dump Jurel.

1104
01:18:33,895 --> 01:18:35,863
Hey, Mr. Jurel,

1105
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:39,925
aren't we gonna do nothin'?

1106
01:18:46,408 --> 01:18:48,568
How could you
be so stupid?

1107
01:18:48,676 --> 01:18:52,203
Would you tell me how you
could be so goddamn stupid?

1108
01:18:57,719 --> 01:18:59,653
As if we don't have
enough problems.

1109
01:19:01,022 --> 01:19:03,820
We're in the middle
of a lawsuit, buddy.

1110
01:19:05,994 --> 01:19:08,019
- Three girls.
- Oh, hey.

1111
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:10,154
Three of our own students.

1112
01:19:10,331 --> 01:19:14,460
Why don't you go to some other school
and get their girls pregnant?

1113
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:19,200
Do you know what this is
gonna do to this school?

1114
01:19:19,306 --> 01:19:21,706
Do you know how
it's gonna look?

1115
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:25,542
Teamwork, Troy,
does not mean going out

1116
01:19:25,646 --> 01:19:27,204
and starting your
own team.

1117
01:19:28,882 --> 01:19:30,406
- What?
- Mr. Rubell?

1118
01:19:30,517 --> 01:19:31,643
What?

1119
01:19:32,586 --> 01:19:33,553
What is this?

1120
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:37,589
It's a search warrant for lockers
50 through 400, inclusive.

1121
01:19:37,825 --> 01:19:39,588
Oh, no, you gotta be
kidding me. When?

1122
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:41,092
Right now.

1123
01:19:51,305 --> 01:19:53,739
Did you know your
cop is flunking?

1124
01:20:00,446 --> 01:20:03,415
I'm trying to talk to them,
but they won't take it seriously.

1125
01:20:04,617 --> 01:20:06,881
That's why it's very important

1126
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:09,348
that everyone be
at that meeting.

1127
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:11,082
Oh, my God.

1128
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,352
- Something wrong?
- What?

1129
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,758
No, no, no, nothing's wrong.

1130
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,700
There's cops out there
searching lockers again.

1131
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:37,216
Get back there.

1132
01:20:37,383 --> 01:20:38,782
Fuck you!

1133
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,649
330, whose is this?

1134
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:24,823
It's his.

1135
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:32,168
You wanna explain this?

1136
01:21:35,205 --> 01:21:36,467
Busted!

1137
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:46,473
Hey, you,
get away from the locker.

1138
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,846
Get away from the locker.

1139
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:53,183
Hold it.

1140
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:55,187
Hey, you.

1141
01:21:56,759 --> 01:21:57,987
Gun!

1142
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,658
Drop the gun.

1143
01:22:01,764 --> 01:22:03,163
Drop the gun!

1144
01:22:03,266 --> 01:22:04,324
No!

1145
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:06,033
Drop it!

1146
01:22:34,897 --> 01:22:36,956
So, why did you
divide your force?

1147
01:22:37,066 --> 01:22:38,533
Why? To prevent escape.

1148
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:41,864
That the Indians would escape
was my greatest fear.

1149
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:46,407
Excuse me, is your name
Herbert Gower?

1150
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:48,368
Yes!

1151
01:22:49,444 --> 01:22:50,502
Okay.

1152
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,778
You mean,
you're not Stuart Van Ark?

1153
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,446
Certainly not.

1154
01:22:56,552 --> 01:22:59,851
You're an outpatient at
Riverdale Mental Hospital?

1155
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:01,351
At times.

1156
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:05,154
Get him out of here.

1157
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,026
- Oh, no.
- Hey, you can't take him.

1158
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:12,058
Sit down!

1159
01:23:19,741 --> 01:23:21,902
Don't you know who I am?

1160
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:24,606
Sure, you're General Custer.

1161
01:23:24,913 --> 01:23:27,142
I am a teacher,

1162
01:23:27,782 --> 01:23:30,478
and you will treat
me as such.

1163
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,630
Mr. Jurel.

1164
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,209
Mr. Van Ark.

1165
01:24:00,247 --> 01:24:01,578
Gower.

1166
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,478
Mr. Gower.

1167
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,775
Where you been?

1168
01:25:11,183 --> 01:25:12,445
Just around.

1169
01:25:13,952 --> 01:25:15,180
You okay?

1170
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:21,481
So, you gonna come back?

1171
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:25,786
Not to this place. No way.

1172
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:31,359
Then what are you
doing here, Eddie?

1173
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,405
I heard about Danny.

1174
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:41,779
Why'd they kill him?
He wouldn't have used the gun.

1175
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,404
Nobody knew that, Eddie.

1176
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,108
Yeah, well, I did.
I knew Danny, man.

1177
01:25:46,217 --> 01:25:48,651
He was just scared.
He was always scared here.

1178
01:25:48,753 --> 01:25:49,845
He wouldn't have
used the gun.

1179
01:25:49,954 --> 01:25:52,354
He just wanted to make sure
nobody got to him, that's all.

1180
01:25:52,456 --> 01:25:53,480
It's not your fault.

1181
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:56,856
No, it is my fault,
'cause I should have been here.

1182
01:26:03,401 --> 01:26:04,993
He was my friend.

1183
01:26:08,071 --> 01:26:09,436
I know that.

1184
01:26:10,974 --> 01:26:12,498
But he's dead.

1185
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:17,674
I'm sorry about it.

1186
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,708
But, Eddie, he's dead,
you're not.

1187
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:23,651
Now, you still got a chance.
You got a chance, the one he didn't have.

1188
01:26:23,754 --> 01:26:25,813
Now, don't lose it.
There's still time.

1189
01:26:25,923 --> 01:26:27,720
What, time for what?

1190
01:26:29,327 --> 01:26:31,317
We both have a lot to do.

1191
01:26:31,628 --> 01:26:33,425
I'm gonna do my part.

1192
01:26:34,531 --> 01:26:36,431
Do yours.
Come back.

1193
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:51,908
You gonna stay,

1194
01:26:52,682 --> 01:26:54,239
or you gonna go?

1195
01:27:13,903 --> 01:27:16,370
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Sloan?

1196
01:27:16,472 --> 01:27:18,838
Yeah, I thought you might
want to know that

1197
01:27:18,941 --> 01:27:21,501
we've reached a
settlement with JFK.

1198
01:27:22,177 --> 01:27:26,136
The school district has agreed
to pay the Calvins $150,000

1199
01:27:26,248 --> 01:27:28,546
with a non-admission of guilt.

1200
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:34,781
Well, what's the matter, Hammond?
You look like I just shot your dog.

1201
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:36,824
You can't be serious.

1202
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,020
This isn't just a routine
contract negotiation,

1203
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,563
this is a school.

1204
01:27:43,665 --> 01:27:46,395
We have the chance
to do what's right.

1205
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:49,932
You know the only thing that's right
is what the client wants.

1206
01:27:50,038 --> 01:27:51,505
They want to settle,
we settle.

1207
01:27:51,606 --> 01:27:55,064
We're a business. Like anybody else,
we make a profit,

1208
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:57,511
hopefully more than most.

1209
01:27:57,612 --> 01:28:01,344
So, we just check the profit and
loss column to see what's right?

1210
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,713
Don't get involved, settle the case,
collect our check

1211
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:06,048
because we're just a business?

1212
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:09,055
Well, what do we tell all those children
who have to attend that school

1213
01:28:09,157 --> 01:28:11,489
and others like them
that aren't gonna learn?

1214
01:28:11,592 --> 01:28:13,958
Sorry kids,
maybe next time.

1215
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:15,689
We lose if we
settle this case,

1216
01:28:15,797 --> 01:28:19,426
because we're helping to turn out
a whole generation of illiterates.

1217
01:28:19,534 --> 01:28:23,527
We're not talking about business here,
damn it. We're talking about the future.

1218
01:28:23,638 --> 01:28:27,198
We're talking about reality, Hammond,
and sometimes it's a pain in the ass.

1219
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:30,105
Leave what's right to God
and the Supreme Court.

1220
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,735
That's what they
get paid for.

1221
01:28:36,216 --> 01:28:37,945
Good night, Hammond.

1222
01:28:48,427 --> 01:28:50,623
No, no, no, wait a minute, now,
listen to me, really, really.

1223
01:28:50,731 --> 01:28:53,564
This kid has beaten up everybody
in the neighborhood,

1224
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,464
and I wanted him bad.

1225
01:29:07,147 --> 01:29:08,512
All right!

1226
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:25,086
So, Mr. Jurel, what's going on?
You getting married or something?

1227
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:28,566
Ms. Warren,

1228
01:29:29,068 --> 01:29:32,970
one does not require a special
occasion to show a little style,

1229
01:29:33,572 --> 01:29:36,199
a little class in one's
personal appearance.

1230
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:38,366
Oh, of course, excuse me.

1231
01:29:38,877 --> 01:29:41,142
Besides, today's my deposition.

1232
01:29:41,614 --> 01:29:44,139
Yeah, and she's good-looking.

1233
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,720
I don't know the names,
but if you do see him,

1234
01:29:48,821 --> 01:29:51,221
have him go directly
to the gym. Okay?

1235
01:29:51,657 --> 01:29:53,284
Mr. Rubell.

1236
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,585
- All waiting down in the gym.
- All right, good.

1237
01:29:56,695 --> 01:29:59,663
Grace, would you find Principal
Horn and have him join us?

1238
01:29:59,764 --> 01:30:02,130
Okay, Malloy,
you've got your deal.

1239
01:30:02,233 --> 01:30:05,202
Now, is the union gonna
stand in our way?

1240
01:30:06,471 --> 01:30:08,336
He's all yours.

1241
01:30:11,743 --> 01:30:12,903
I hate making deals,

1242
01:30:13,011 --> 01:30:15,809
but I sure as hell don't want anybody
around who could hurt us the next time.

1243
01:30:15,914 --> 01:30:17,108
Yeah.

1244
01:30:17,215 --> 01:30:18,375
What about the gym teacher?

1245
01:30:18,483 --> 01:30:20,348
He's cooperating.
We're putting him in another school.

1246
01:30:20,451 --> 01:30:23,352
- Rosenberg?
- I'm having him come in today.

1247
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:44,239
Mr. Jurel?

1248
01:30:45,476 --> 01:30:48,707
Mr. Jurel, you're wanted
in the gymnasium.

1249
01:30:49,546 --> 01:30:51,013
What for?

1250
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:53,014
I'm sure I don't know.

1251
01:31:02,092 --> 01:31:03,616
Ah, Mr. Jurel,

1252
01:31:04,161 --> 01:31:06,322
won't you join us, please?

1253
01:31:23,947 --> 01:31:27,075
- What's going on?
- Please be seated, Mr. Jurel.

1254
01:31:38,427 --> 01:31:39,724
Mr. Jurel,

1255
01:31:41,297 --> 01:31:44,755
how happy are you here,
at John F. Kennedy?

1256
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:52,030
What is this all about?

1257
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,038
We feel, that is,

1258
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,745
all of the board members
present and myself,

1259
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,338
that it would be best

1260
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:03,648
if you

1261
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:06,652
were to tender
your resignation.

1262
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:09,246
- Why?
- Because,

1263
01:32:10,392 --> 01:32:11,723
Mr. Jurel,

1264
01:32:12,662 --> 01:32:16,119
nobody here wants to go through
the pain of firing you.

1265
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:29,972
You can't fire me,

1266
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:32,707
I've got tenure.

1267
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,646
Hey, I just heard they're
gonna fire Jurel.

1268
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,018
What?
Where'd you hear that?

1269
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:48,490
The office. Old lady Wensel
was talking about it.

1270
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,903
Mr. Jurel, you know a student
named Diane Warren?

1271
01:32:57,304 --> 01:33:01,070
Isn't it true you took Diane Warren,
a 16-year-old student,

1272
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:04,005
to the free clinic to
have an abortion?

1273
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:08,279
The abortion was performed
without parental consent.

1274
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:13,643
- Roger?
- I'm waiting for your answer.

1275
01:33:15,155 --> 01:33:16,452
Roger.

1276
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,658
Now, come on, Roger.

1277
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,422
Talk to me.

1278
01:33:21,528 --> 01:33:25,361
Do you think that this is proper
conduct for a teacher?

1279
01:33:29,135 --> 01:33:33,629
Well, it's a hell of a lot better conduct
than the teacher that got her pregnant.

1280
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,231
And what was
his name?

1281
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,037
You son of a bitch.

1282
01:33:46,619 --> 01:33:49,644
I just figured what
this is all about.

1283
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:53,651
You know, this isn't about a
16-year-old girl that got pregnant.

1284
01:33:54,861 --> 01:33:58,695
Oh, hell no, that's the last thing
that this would be about.

1285
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:03,497
We're afraid of what
old Alex is gonna say

1286
01:34:03,603 --> 01:34:05,935
at his deposition today.

1287
01:34:06,739 --> 01:34:09,674
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna say.

1288
01:34:10,009 --> 01:34:13,171
Wouldn't you like to hear that,
Rog, old buddy?

1289
01:34:13,412 --> 01:34:15,107
Forget it, Alex.

1290
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,815
The case has been
settled already.

1291
01:34:18,316 --> 01:34:20,807
There's not gonn
be a deposition.

1292
01:34:21,653 --> 01:34:23,177
It's over.

1293
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:29,658
Your resignation, Mr. Jurel.

1294
01:34:30,228 --> 01:34:32,492
Oh, for Christ's sake, Burke,

1295
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:34,992
what do you think,
that's gonna stop me?

1296
01:34:35,099 --> 01:34:37,624
A disgruntled former employee,

1297
01:34:37,735 --> 01:34:41,330
who was fired, connected with
sexual misconduct.

1298
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:43,968
Now,
who would listen to you?

1299
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:48,575
Who's gonna listen to you?

1300
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:52,779
Take the deal, Alex.

1301
01:34:54,052 --> 01:34:55,144
- Take it.
- Roger.

1302
01:34:55,253 --> 01:34:57,550
Sign the paper and
then go home.

1303
01:34:57,655 --> 01:35:01,182
Tomorrow, go out and look
for another job. Do it, Alex.

1304
01:35:02,927 --> 01:35:06,419
Or you'll never work as a teacher
for the rest of your life.

1305
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,225
I promise you that.

1306
01:35:13,404 --> 01:35:14,962
Oh, Roger.

1307
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:21,574
Well.

1308
01:35:23,747 --> 01:35:27,444
Larry. Hey, Larry.
Come on, Larry.

1309
01:35:29,385 --> 01:35:31,512
Help me out.
Come on, Larry.

1310
01:35:33,256 --> 01:35:36,988
I mean, is three minutes all
we got left to fight for?

1311
01:35:41,732 --> 01:35:42,892
Larry?

1312
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:49,401
You son of a bitch.

1313
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:51,507
Son of a bitch.

1314
01:36:03,853 --> 01:36:05,616
I hope it's worth it.

1315
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,310
Alex.

1316
01:36:40,689 --> 01:36:42,714
You were right all along.

1317
01:36:43,358 --> 01:36:46,691
The case wasn't about education,
it was about money.

1318
01:36:47,629 --> 01:36:49,062
They settled.

1319
01:36:50,332 --> 01:36:53,494
- It's over. - Your news
bulletin's a little late.

1320
01:36:55,736 --> 01:36:56,725
What are you doing?

1321
01:36:56,838 --> 01:36:59,329
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm packing.

1322
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,839
I quit.

1323
01:37:01,576 --> 01:37:04,067
- You can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

1324
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:06,777
Why?

1325
01:37:08,249 --> 01:37:10,444
Some schoolteacher knocked up
a 16-year-old girl,

1326
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,019
and I took her to
get an abortion.

1327
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,112
Now, if I don't resign,
they're gonna nail my ass to the wall.

1328
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:19,819
They're bluffing, Alex.
They'd never risk the publicity.

1329
01:37:21,863 --> 01:37:23,854
Didn't you hear what
I said before?

1330
01:37:23,965 --> 01:37:26,490
The school system settled the case.
They paid them off.

1331
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:30,059
The school was more afraid
of publicity than of losing.

1332
01:37:30,538 --> 01:37:32,165
Fight 'em, Alex.

1333
01:37:32,874 --> 01:37:35,240
You still can't see it, can you?

1334
01:37:36,811 --> 01:37:38,676
Nobody cares!

1335
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,174
I'm out.

1336
01:37:45,919 --> 01:37:47,750
I'm through fighting.

1337
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:52,315
I can't make a difference.

1338
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:53,824
Yes, you can!

1339
01:38:57,022 --> 01:38:58,717
So, you gonna stay,

1340
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:01,252
or you gonna go?

1341
01:39:19,344 --> 01:39:21,869
No!
No, damn it!

1342
01:39:22,146 --> 01:39:25,274
Don't you walk away, Alex!
Don't you turn your back on this

1343
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:27,142
just because you're scared!

1344
01:39:27,251 --> 01:39:29,913
So, everybody loses,
is that it, Alex?

1345
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:32,522
Just because you're the one
who's afraid to face reality?

1346
01:39:32,623 --> 01:39:34,283
You're the one who's afraid
to drop your shields,

1347
01:39:34,391 --> 01:39:38,327
because if you did you know you'd have
to take the risk of staying and fighting.

1348
01:39:38,428 --> 01:39:41,124
You're the one who's afraid
to walk naked down the hall.

1349
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:42,892
Well, I'm not.

1350
01:39:43,367 --> 01:39:45,164
You're scared, Alex.

1351
01:39:45,702 --> 01:39:49,434
There's a whole room full of kids
in there, and they care!

1352
01:39:49,574 --> 01:39:51,974
And there's a hell of a lot more
where they come from.

1353
01:39:52,076 --> 01:39:54,476
They need you,
and you need them,

1354
01:39:54,579 --> 01:39:58,776
but you just pretend it isn't real
so you have an excuse to walk away.

1355
01:39:58,882 --> 01:40:01,407
For Christ's sake,
put your clothes on, Lisa.

1356
01:40:01,518 --> 01:40:03,577
Well, I'm not afraid
to face reality.

1357
01:40:03,687 --> 01:40:06,247
I'm not afraid to walk
naked down the hall.

1358
01:40:06,356 --> 01:40:08,290
- Lisa. Lisa!
- Alex, come on.

1359
01:40:08,392 --> 01:40:10,155
- Come on, Alex.
- Lisa!

1360
01:40:10,427 --> 01:40:11,553
Lisa!

1361
01:40:12,996 --> 01:40:15,328
Damn it, baby, please get dressed,
or I'm gonna call the cops.

1362
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:17,992
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- That's it, I'm calling the cops.

1363
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:20,728
Central, this is hall D calling.
Get the cops up here, right away.

1364
01:40:46,295 --> 01:40:47,592
Lisa,

1365
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,397
you are crazy.
You are absolutely crazy.

1366
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,491
And you are a teacher.

1367
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:56,968
Alex Jurel, the teacher.

1368
01:40:58,707 --> 01:41:00,937
Don't let them destroy that.

1369
01:41:06,948 --> 01:41:08,176
Oh, God.

1370
01:41:09,184 --> 01:41:10,776
Oh, Lisa, jeez.

1371
01:41:20,762 --> 01:41:21,854
Come on.

1372
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:30,362
Are you gonna stay,
or you gonna go?

1373
01:41:30,638 --> 01:41:32,833
Take Lisa out of here, okay?

1374
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:35,307
All right,
I can handle that.

1375
01:41:43,051 --> 01:41:46,282
I just think I was a little hasty, maybe.
What do you think?

1376
01:41:46,387 --> 01:41:48,981
I don't wanna go to another school.
I love this school.

1377
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:52,423
Alex, look at this.
They're making me resign, Alex.

1378
01:41:54,228 --> 01:41:56,560
What the hell are you...
He signed that.

1379
01:41:56,663 --> 01:41:58,654
They can't make
you resign, Carl.

1380
01:41:58,765 --> 01:42:01,734
- What?
- Nobody is resigning.

1381
01:42:02,436 --> 01:42:03,596
No?

1382
01:42:05,205 --> 01:42:06,672
Hey, my car!

1383
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:09,270
Hey, that's my car.

1384
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:12,572
That's my car.
What happened to my car?

1385
01:42:13,847 --> 01:42:17,543
- I'm not gonna resign, Roger.
- You're finished. You're out.

1386
01:42:18,185 --> 01:42:19,880
Oh, hell, Burke,

1387
01:42:19,987 --> 01:42:21,818
I'm gonna tell you something.
I haven't even started.

1388
01:42:21,922 --> 01:42:24,413
Now, listen,
if you try and fire me,

1389
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:26,525
I'm gonna be suing you.

1390
01:42:27,594 --> 01:42:29,221
What's that gonna solve, Alex?

1391
01:42:29,329 --> 01:42:32,560
I don't know, Roger,
but let's try it and find out.

1392
01:42:32,799 --> 01:42:35,563
The damn school wasn't built
for us, Roger.

1393
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:40,071
It wasn't built for your unions, your
lawyers, and all your other institutions.

1394
01:42:40,173 --> 01:42:42,198
It was built for the kids.

1395
01:42:42,408 --> 01:42:44,376
They're not here for us.

1396
01:42:44,744 --> 01:42:46,507
We're here for them.

1397
01:42:46,712 --> 01:42:49,442
That's what it's about.
Kids.

1398
01:42:50,316 --> 01:42:54,946
Alex, half of them aren't even
coming back after the alarm.

1399
01:42:55,888 --> 01:42:57,378
But half will.

1400
01:42:58,758 --> 01:43:00,783
I think they're worth it.

1401
01:43:02,961 --> 01:43:05,794
Jurel, you're crazy,
you know that?

1402
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:09,234
What can I say?
I'm a teacher.

1403
01:43:12,905 --> 01:43:14,429
I'm a teacher.

1404
01:43:19,378 --> 01:43:21,243
All right, Jurel!

1405
01:43:26,218 --> 01:43:28,311
You're the man, Jurel!

1406
01:43:29,054 --> 01:43:31,852
Don't let them push you around,
Mr. Jurel.

1407
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:36,287
Forget to tell me about
the fire alarm?

1408
01:43:36,576 --> 01:43:38,246
You're a teacher.

1409
01:43:57,905 --> 01:44:03,426
