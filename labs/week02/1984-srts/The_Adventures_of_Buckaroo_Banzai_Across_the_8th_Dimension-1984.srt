1
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,413
Launch control is having trouble
verifying mass acceleration.

2
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,583
Team Banzai rotational supervisor,
please confirm.

3
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:32,945
I want an electromagnetic
fuel reading from the launch.

4
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:39,145
We are T minus seven zero and holding.

5
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:43,229
Antigravity inertia reversal crosscheck.

6
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:48,065
Can we have a photographic
printout to the bunker?

7
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,347
T minus six zero three and holding.
Phaser positive. Latch compressor.

8
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,545
Multistage
axial compressor... latched.

9
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:01,719
Fuel pressure... 1800 torrs.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,436
Commence pullback to
the launch sequence. Clear the launch.

11
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,994
Specific density is 2.5. Over.

12
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:16,277
Youre kidding. Hes still at the hospital?

13
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,841
Banzai hasnt showed yet, Mr Secretary.

14
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,685
Looks like hes got cold feet.

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,247
Well, better go see whats
keeping the boss, Reno.

16
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,727
Why me?

17
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,521
Cos Im busy.

18
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:34,085
May I have the curved Yasargil, please?

19
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:36,443
Its not here, Dr Banzai.

20
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,965
Ah, let me have the straight one then.

21
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,292
See, this is the part where for me
it started looking like a problem.

22
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:45,490
I mean, I wanted to sacrifice the precentral
vein in order to get some exposure.

23
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:48,817
But because of this guys normal variation,
I got excited and all the sudden I didnt know

24
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,411
whether I was looking at the precentral vein or one
of the internal cerebro veins or the Vein of Galen

25
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:56,456
or the Basilar vein of Rosenthal, so one my own me at
this point I was ready to say "Thats it, lets get out".

26
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,543
See, you can check
your anatomy all you want,

27
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,227
and even though there may be normal
variation, if you get right down to it,

28
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:05,067
this far inside the head,
it all looks the same.

29
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:08,146
No, no, no. Dont tug on that.
You never know what it might be attached to.

30
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,868
This is control.
02 vents are closed. Looks good.

31
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:18,664
Dr Banzai is using the laser
to vaporise a pineal tumour

32
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,355
without damaging
the quadrigeminal plate.

33
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:24,275
Subcutaneous microphone gonna
allow the patient to transmit

34
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,832
verbal instructions to his own brain.

35
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:31,510
Like "Raise my left arm"?
Or "Throw the harpoon".

36
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,553
People are gonna come from all over.
This boys an Eskimo.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,638
You ever thought about
joining me full time?

38
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:40,754
What do you mean? You serious?
Do you have an opening?

39
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:44,594
Uhhuh. Can you sing?

40
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,399
A little. Yeah. I can dance.

41
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:48,961
Hey, its Buckaroo.

42
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:52,047
We have Buckaroo descending.
We have him on the launch parameter.

43
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,768
Inertial control positive.
T minus five four five. Resume counting.

44
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,483
Hey, hey, Rawhide!

45
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:03,448
All systems righteous.
Professor Hikita says we have a go.

46
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:17,771
Im teeing off in an hour and a half.
Whats this jalopy supposed to do anyway?

47
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,451
500 miles an hour, General.
Oh, Senator, youre so gullible.

48
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:30,657
Please clear the launch grid.
Please clear the launch grid.

49
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,578
HB 88, this is control.

00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,388
You are on your
onboard computer. Over.

56
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,839
Roger, I copy.

57
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,717
Altimeters? Compasses?
Set and crosschecked.

58
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,676
Reserve brake system two?
Closed and guarded.

00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:23,400
Radios, radar and transponder?
Set and stand by.

64
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:32,767
HB 88, this is control.
IMU alignment in progress.

65
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,534
We show 28 degrees, 36 minutes.

66
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:40,936
30.32 seconds north...
by 80 degrees, 36 minutes.

67
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:44,769
14.8 seconds west.
Synchro is aligned.

68

HB 88, this is control.
Ground crew secure. Over.

69
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:17,308
INS ram coordinates.
Form one, fuel ticket?

70
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:20,392
On board.
Circuit breakers?

71
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:23,987
Point of no return. Five, four, three...

72
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,110
We have main engine start.
..two, one.

73
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,679
Electronuclear carburation seems fine.

74
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:47,003
Hes fast. lll give Banzai that. But one
heatseeking missile and hes history.

75
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:50,599
This is control. APU start is go.

76
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:54,358
Youre on your onboard computer. Over.

77
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,043
They are reading you on the localiser
downrange. Looks good. Over.

78
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,165
HB 88, this is control.

79
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:05,766
Speed steady at 317 nautical.
400 and accelerating!

80
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:11,047
Horizontal velocity is expanding. Over.

81
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,328
Four... three...
Here he comes.

82
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,259
..two... one.

83
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,944
Wheres he going?
Yeah!

84
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,659
He is off course.
This is Chase One. Over.

85
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,504
He has broken trajectory...

86
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:33,586
50 cylinder. There is an immediate
fire hazard. Do you read?

87
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,586
Roger.
Do you read?

88
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,465
Advise you abort. Over.
Repeat: advise you cancel phase two!

89
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,188
What the hells phase two?
Thats a big nocando.

90
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:49,865
Buckaroo, are you decompressing? Over.

91
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:53,714
Hes broken the sound barrier!
Mach 1.3.

92
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:57,992
Buckaroo, do you read?
Commence braking procedure. Over.

93
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,429
Just be cool. Shell hold.

94
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:04,515
Axis negative.
Pneumatic pressure negative.

95
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,872
We are looking at 500 degrees...

96
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,553
We are in pursuit.
He is gaining. Over.

97
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:12,994
Hes headed for the mountains!

98
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,640
Eject, Buckaroo! Eject!

99
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:22,090
HB 88, do you read? Do you read? Over.
This is control. Do you read?

100
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,840
Unsafe levels of...

101
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:30,129
Standby recirculation has been activated.

102
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,807
HB 88, this is control. Do you...

103
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,454
Hotel Brava 88 do you read?
Do you read? Over.

104
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,534
What is going on?
Its off my scope.

105
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:59,375
This is Chase One. We got his tracks.
They go right up to a wall of rock.

106
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,021
Holy shit!

107
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,316
This is Chase Two. Chase Two.
We see him. We see him.

108
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:41,002
We have him. Chase Two reports
a visual 100 miles off course.

109
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:42,002
Banzai!

110
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:47,040
Hes gone through it.
Hes gone through the mountain.

111
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,364
It has deployed there.

112
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,007
There is a minimal disturbance
in the electromagnetic field.

113
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,885
Antigravity inertia is normal.

114
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,483
Mass acceleration is diminishing. Over.

115
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,129
He is OK.

116
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:07,649
The vehicle is hot, but we are
showing no radioactivity. Over.

117
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:12,489
HB 88, this is control. We see you.
Welcome home. Over.

118
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,897
We show electricalfield aberrations
on the windshield.

119
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:21,221
We are getting a localised vibration
of the drive train and a minor oil leak.

120
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:24,141
Buckaroo, can you verify
operational capability?

121
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:31,587
HB 88, this is control.

122
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:34,861
We are reading an electrical
field aberration of 993

123
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,903
on your windshield, static and fracture.
Can you confirm? Over.

124
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,315
HB 88, this is control.
Do you hear me? Over.

125
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:58,197
We are getting localised vibration on
your drive shaft. Can you verify? Over.

126
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:13,160
HB 88, a retrieval vehicle
will rendezvous in ten minutes. Over.

127
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:27,364
Well, there it is,
tyre tracks right up to a wall of rock.

128
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:30,962
Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno.

129
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:35,852
cute guys of the Hong Kong Cavaliers,
Buckaroos most trusted inner circle..

130
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:40,567
Could you elaborate on that device,
I believe, dubbed the "oscillator"...

131
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,057
Oscillation overthruster.
Hikita!

132
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,970
Thank you, Allison.
That dirty little Asian critter!.

133
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:57,066
Tranquillisers are being dispensed
to all patients between 10 and 11 am,.

134
00:11:57,187 --> 00:12:00,545
Tuesday, Friday and Wednesday..

135
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,832
The sound barrier crumbles,
and then the dimension barrier..

136
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:18,144
It was, Buckaroo Banzai said, exactly like
Professor Hikita had glimpsed in 1938.

137
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:23,715
through the overthruster he and Dr Emilio
Lizardo put together from spare parts.

138
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,068
in a laboratory at Princeton..

139
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,990
1938. Can you imagine what it
must have been like then?.

140
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,482
Molto grazie, Dr Lizardo.

141
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:49,279
Almost ready, Dr Lizardo! Almost.

142
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,252
Electromagnets, they are charging.

143
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:15,975
Catapult, shes wired!

144
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:20,380
No. Not yet. No!

145
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:22,939
Whoo!

146
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,339
No, not yet! Not yet! Im not ready!

147
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:49,674
He did not go through the wall.

148
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,835
Holy Toledo!

149
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:05,202
Facile. Sotto, dottor..

150
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,362
Emilio?

151
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,978
..asked what he saw,
asked where he went,.

152
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:44,415
Dr Banzai replied "Vast chasms
of hissing swamp, spurts of flame,.

153
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,853
huge thunderclaps
and gurgling rock formations.".

154
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:53,184
Lithium is no longer
available on credit..

155
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,463
GsubE...

156
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:04,301
Gesů Cristo, make the ganglia twitch.
Were home free..

157
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:10,145
Home... home is where
you wear your hat.

158
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:14,427
I feel so break up, I want to go home!

159
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:18,790
Hello, Doc. Who are we today?
Albert Einstein?

160
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,794
No. Lord John Whorfin.

161
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,627
If theres one thing I hate,
its to be mistaken for somebody else.

162
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,710
Cheer up, Lizardo. Its Friday. I got
a care package from your yoyo friends.

163
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:34,277
Hey, Signore...

164
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:36,601
grazie tanto..

165
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,603
Thanks, Doc.

166
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:41,763
I come for your TV.
Youve been using too much juice.

167
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:44,767
Another 10,000 kilowatts
again this month.

168
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,926
It beats me how an old homicidal
loony can use that much power.

169
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:50,805
Go on, take it! I dont need it!

170
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:56,487
Tomorrow Im goin home
with my overthruster.

171
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,091
Thats terrific, Doc.

172
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:04,412
lll make sure you get
an early wakeup call.

173
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,454
Laugh while you can, monkey boy.

174
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:23,302
Buckaroo, Ive done
a spectrographic analysis

175
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:27,422
on the specimen you pulled
off the jet car drive shaft.

176
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,222
Rawhide, what do you think?

177
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,463
I dont care if you walked
through a mountain in Texas.

178
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,223
This is New Jersey, and when you
play my joint, youre just another act.

179
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:42,030
I want some music out of you.
You want it, Artie? You got it.

180
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:46,992
Lets rock and roll!

181
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:55,878
Ladies and gentlemen, Arties Artery
is proud to present for a single night only,.

182
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,596
New Brunswicks own,
the one, the only, the amazing...

183
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:03,479
Buckaroo Banzai and
the Hong Kong Cavaliers!.

184
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,473
Excuse me.

185
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:18,435
Excuse me, is someone out there
not having a good time?

186
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,785
Is somebody...

187
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,194
is somebody crying...

188
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,518
out there in the darkness?

189
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:32,201
Somebody crying?

190
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:35,599
Over here. Im sorry.

191
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:42,321
Um, could we get... could we
get her a mike and a spotlight?

192
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:45,283
Tommy, could we run her a mike?

193
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:50,323
What, are you serious?
Yeah, run her over a mike.

194
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,322
Whats your name?

195
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,491
Who cares?
Right..

196
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:59,926
Well, I care. Whats your name?

197
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:07,054
Penny.
Did you say Peggy?

198
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,933
No. My names Penny. Penny Priddy.

199
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,782
That doesnt matter.
Its not important..

200
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:22,138
I just... I just sponged up
a little too much Vat 69, thats all.

201
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:26,346
Im down to my last nickel
in this lousy town,

202
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,745
and they wouldnt take
my luggage in hock.

203
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,303
I lost my room at the Y this morning.

204
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,189
But its cool.

205
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,667
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, now.

206
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,026
Dont be mean.

207
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:47,309
We dont have to be mean,
cos, remember...

208
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:52,513
no matter where you go...
there you are.

209
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:14,644
Im gonna sing this song for you, Peggy.
No, Penny! Who cares?

210
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:27,331
I dont have plans and schemes..

211
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:29,969
And I..

212
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:34,810
Dont have hopes and dreams..

213
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:41,416
I dont have anything..

214
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,215
This is weird.
Sure is.

215
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:48,466
Since I dont have you..

216
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:52,587
Yeah, I..
Whos the girl?

217
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:57,499
Dont have fond desires..

218
00:20:57,627 --> 00:21:04,823
I dont have happy hours..

219
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:11,860
I dont have anything..

220
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,675
Get her outta here now! Lets go!
Let me go! Let me go, you freaks!

221
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:26,587
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
Kill that spot. Kill it!

222
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:35,518
..festive briefing by the
Banzai Institute. Tomorrow...

223
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,322
Where you think youre going, Doc? The moon?

224
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:41,680
No, no. Planet Ten.
Planet Ten. Why, pray tell?

225
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,719
Operator?
Doc, put down the phone.

226
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:48,448
Operator? I wanna make a call
to a Mr John Bigbooty

227
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:53,729
at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems
over in Grovers Mill.

228
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,290
And you tell him that
its John Whorfin calling.

229
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,648
Thats WHORFIN.
You got that, honey?

230
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,567
John. JOHN.
This better be collect, Doc.

231
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:16,543
Bigbooty? Of course its me, you fool!
Who do you think?

232
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:19,016
The time has come, Bigbooty.

233
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:21,423
Prepare for my return.

234
00:22:22,744 --> 00:22:25,388
Well, havent you heard?
Dont you watch TV?

235
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:31,064
Banzai and Hikita have done it.
They have opened the window!

236
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:36,147
Si. Si. So meet me at the factory..

237
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:39,230
And get their overthruster.

238
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:41,232
And Hikita, too.

239
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:43,584
Sure. Alive.

240
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:48,151
No, no, dont worry about me.
lll get my own ride.

241
00:22:55,843 --> 00:23:00,679
Evil will not prevail. That was...

242
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:06,400
Arrivederci, Jersey..

243
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:09,647
Goodbye, goodbye to her..

244
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:19,122
Its the spittin image.
Doesnt look anything like her..

245
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:21,004
Pictures dont lie.

246
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,128
Hell they dont. Met my first wife that way.

247
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:29,769
Its Peggy to these eyes. Its the
same nose. Its the same hair.

248
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:32,653
Plus, Buckaroo has to think so too
or else he wouldnt be ready

249
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,926
to make a fool of himself.

250
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,819
Just hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo.
Thought youd wanna be notified.

251
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:46,697
Remember that old Italian pal
of the professors?

252
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,339
Emilio Lizardo.
Yeah.

253
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:52,380
Last night he kills a guard, breaks out of
Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane.

254
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:55,978
Ten minutes later, he cops a Maserati
Bora. Totalled it a block away.

255
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:57,259
Holy moly.

256
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,829
Maserati Bora.
Mmhm. That aint all.

257
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,623
Hes vanished. Thin air.

258
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:09,227
Dr Lizardo. Wasnt he on TV once?
Youre thinking of Mr Wizard.

259
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:12,234
This guy is a
top scientist, dummkopf.

260
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:17,428
So was Mr Wizard.
Dr Emilio Lizardo is a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy.

261
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:21,441
A vicious psychopath.
Just as soon kill you as go fishin.

262
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,195
Buckaroo, look at this.

263
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:32,236
Grosslyabnormal highaltitude
electrostatic disturbance

264
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:35,599
moving down over Connecticut.
From the jet car, do you think?

265
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:38,562
No, not from the jet car.
Check with NORAD Command.

266
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:43,526
It could be aboveground atomic testing
in China. Maybe sunspot activity.

267
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,050
Man, thats strange.

268
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,970
Scientists at Strategious Space Command have detected.

269
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:54,930
a mysterious radioactive cloudlike
mass over southern New England..

270
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:59,174
Sources close to the National Security
Consortium have refused to comment..

271
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:04,738
Lets get on back to three
great modern country hits in a row..

272
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:08,812
Sidney!
Buckaroo!

273
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,332
Hows the patient?
Fine, thanks to you.

274
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:13,342
But more importantly: Congratulations!
Thank you.

275
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,899
You drove right through
a mountain the other day.

276
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:18,825
You did it right after you left me at the operation.
You havent even said anything about it.

277
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:21,018
Didnt mention it.
Sidney, these are my friends.

278
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:24,665
This is my colleague Dr Sidney Zwibel, old
medical friend from Columbia P and S.

279
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:26,941
Howdy. How youre doing?
Listen, Sidney, Im glad you could make it.

280
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:29,379
Cos it looks like we may need an
extra hand sooner than I thought.

281
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,464
Aha, I see. Thats what I was wondering about.

282
00:25:31,593 --> 00:25:34,980
I got your message about rendezvousing
at this address. Barely had time to pack.

283
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,310
Then I came here...
I can see that.

284
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,791
Im gonna snoop around.
Make yourself at home.

285
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:45,635
You know, I thought we were gonna
rehearse or something.

286
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:49,397
Im a big fan of all you guys. I love
the comic books and the records.

287
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,272
I know you. Youre Pecos.

288
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,630
Perfect Tommy.
Perfect Tommy. Im sorry.

289
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,117
Youre Pecos.
Pecos is in Tibet. Names Reno.

290
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:00,802
Reno! Its an honour.
Where do you hail from, Doc?

291
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:04,363
Uh, New Jersey. Fort Lee.
Where are your spurs at?

292
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,885
Is he making fun of me?

293
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,799
Third cell to the left. Pink dress.

294
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,487
Arigato..

295
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:29,050
What do you want? Huh?
What are you doin here?

296
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,297
What are you doing here?

297
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:35,175
Why dont you just go away
and let me rot?

298
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,860
Who were you really trying
to annihilate last night?

299
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:45,415
You. Just like the papers all say.

300
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,944
Come over here.

301
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:53,938
Come on.

302
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,186
Oh, my God! Perfect Tommy!.

303
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,985
What do you want from me?

304
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:11,664
Oh, you remind me of someone
I once knew long ago.

305
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:17,956
Was she very beautiful?

306
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:23,322
She was... queen of the Netherlands.

307
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:25,752
Thats a long way
from where I come from.

308
00:27:25,881 --> 00:27:29,239
Wyoming? Cody, Wyoming?

309
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,921
No, Im from Laramie.

310
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:35,799
Except that I was born in Cody,
but nobody...

311
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,000
Do you have family?
Back in Cody, I mean?.

312
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,242
I dont know..

313
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:45,207
See, I always felt that there was
another part of me somewhere.

314
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,484
Another part of you?

315
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:49,969
Somewhere, yeah.

316
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,922
Im adopted.

317
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,809
Of course!

318
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,975
If it was a snake, itd have bit me!

319
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,375
Another you.
Anythings possible.

320
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,014
Let her out!
Hey, me too..

321
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,419
Let her out?
Yeah, let her out. lll be responsible.

322
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,536
Shes a killer!
No, shes not. And give her your coat.

323
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:12,062
Why me?

324
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,298
Because youre perfect.

325
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,822
You have a point there.

326
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,258
Id like to move this thing along.

327
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:29,907
Perhaps some of you noticed we have
a motorcycle convention rolling in here.

328
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,390
Were a little short of time.

329
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:35,950
Besides, I dont imagine you
came here to listen to me talk.

330
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:38,063
Youre right.

331
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:45,185
Without further ado, Id like
to introduce a young man

332
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,314
who yesterday took our notions
of reality and turned them inside out.

333
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:54,512
Dr Buckaroo Banzai,
perhaps you can explain yourself.

334
00:28:58,765 --> 00:28:59,993
Ooh.

335
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:04,805
Secretary, Senator Cunningham...
members of the world press.

336
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:09,559
30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and
father, Doctors Sandra and Masado Banzai.

337
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:13,322
gave their lives for what was then
considered to be a very insane notion...

338
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:17,767
the possibility of contacting alien life..

339
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:22,448
However, not on another planet. But here..

340
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,729
Maybe right inside this table...

341
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:29,930
living on a simultaneous plane
of existence with our own..

342
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,935
Perhaps within a mountain.

343
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:38,058
See this rock? Its solid matter, right?

344
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:42,892
But the solid parts of this rock the
neutrons, quarks, protons and electrons...

345
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:44,459
comprise only about

346
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:47,307
one quadrillionth of its total volume.

347
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:49,544
How many zeros is that?
Quite a few.

348
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:52,899
The rest of this rock
is actually empty space.

349
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,581
So, back in 1937, Professor Hikita here
and Dr Emilio Lizardo

350
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,103
figured that if solid matter
were mostly just empty space,

351
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:04,351
a person should be able to discover
a way to travel inside things.

352
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:08,549
We at the Banzai Institute
have at last found that way.

353
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:11,397
We have created a device

354
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,876
called an oscillation overthruster,

355
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:18,677
which systematically reorders matter

356
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,079
by annihilating electrons, positrons...

357
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:26,833
I get it. What youre saying is that
oppositelycharged particles collide,

358
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:31,640
and blow each other up in a burst of energy.
Like a tiny big bang, like a... baby bang.

359
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,480
Im probably just stating the very obvious.
Shut up, Penny. Shut up.

360
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:41,491
Oh, no. Its not obvious at all. If it was obvious,
everybody would be doing it every day.

361
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:45,922
See, by all accounts, it appears as though
I literally went right through a mountain.

362
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:49,842
But you could take that mountain
and pulverise it...

363
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:54,768
and sift through it like breadcrumbs
for the rest of your natural life...

364
00:30:54,898 --> 00:31:00,054
and you would never ever find... this.

365
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:06,013
And yet this living organism came out
of that mountain in Texas with me.

366
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:09,853
Even though I was never
inside that mountain.

367
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,899
The presidents calling.

368
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:15,100
The president of what?
The president of the United States.

369
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,501
Oh. Here.

370
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:18,820
Later.

371
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:22,944
Is he still delirious?
I cant tell. Its real fuzzy. I patched him through to a payphone down the hall.

372
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:27,032
Do your thing.
Buckaroo, you forgot your thruster.

373
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,907
Why dont you hold onto it for a while?

374
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,783
Any time.

375
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:34,348
Do we have the first slide, please?

376
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,752
What about the Pentagon?
The possibility of war

377
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:40,267
in the Eighth Dimension, Mr Secretary?

378
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,350
What?

379
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,990
It seemed like a strange connection
even back at the bus.

380
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,317
Mr President?

381
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,358
Some kind of interference.

382
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,039
Hello, Mr President?

383
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,203
Mr President? Mr President, hello?.

384
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,399
Hello, Mr President?.

385
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:06,840
Whats going on?
Maybe its a prankster, some computer whiz kid.

386
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,925
Not with Elephant Bravo.

387
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,169
Not with an alpha clearance.
Alpha clearance? Hello? Mr...

388
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:17,412
Ed, go back to the bus and reroute this call to
the presidents suite at Walter Reed Hospital.

389
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:22,164
Yeah, and make sure this is on the level.
Were busy people here.

390
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,332
Does the President call him a lot?

391
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,739
Pencil! Pen! Quick! Anything!

392
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,533
Dont touch him!

393
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:36,937
Whats he writing?.

394
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,418
Conference room!

395
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,457
Conference room! Lets go!.

396
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,860
Launch thermopod.

397
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:56,507
There they are.
Dr Banzai..

398
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,102
Dont you see em?
What do you mean? Who?

399
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:03,433
Evil! Pure and simple from the
Eighth Dimension! Grab em!

400
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,353
Lectroids! Grab em!
Lectroids? Hes got a gun..

401
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,792
OK, wise guy!

402
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,078
Let those gun belts hit the floor!
Nobody follows or the Prof is history!

403
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,036
Wheres Buckaroo?
Get him..

404
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:27,125
Wheres the overthruster?
Get an ambulance..

405
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:46,646
Come on, will you just ignore them?
Isnt that...?

406
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:11,735
Hey, wait a minute! You cant ride that!

407
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:15,299
Its Buckaroo Banzai!

408
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:28,543
Hold it!
Freeze!

409
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:53,644
I had my eyes open all day long, Burt.
It may not be a total loss.

410
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:57,966
Im about ready to go home.
We might see something.

411
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,448
I hit it! It is wounded.

412
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,482
Whatd it look like to you?

413
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:12,651
Like a big black flying dinosaur.
Dinosaur? It was purple.

414
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:17,405
Thats what it looked like. It was black.
It was purple. Itll be dark before we even find it.

415
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,615
We get Professor Hikita
to cough up the crucial missing circuit

416
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,934
and then we finally get our butts off this rock!

417
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,812
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

418
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:31,059
Well, what is it? What is it?

419
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:33,059
Black thermopod emergency beacon!

420
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:35,745
Here? On Earth?

421
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:39,701
Why? John Bigbooté, why?
Coordinates established.

422
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:42,706
Electromagnetic energy
back on route three.

423
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:03,555
The whole top of the trees squashed!
Do you think it up there?

424
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:05,508
Lets wait for the cops, Burt.

425
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:08,436
What for? Are you scared?

426
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,596
Theres gotta be something there.
Come on, Burt. Theres nothing up there.

427
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:15,032
Well, how do you know?
Here, hold this. Hold this!

428
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:20,401
Where you going? Where you going?!

429
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:22,481
Christmas shopping.

430
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:27,918
Whats that?
Its a stick. Whats it look like?

431
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,599
Gimme some light, will ya?
I got two guns in my hands.

432
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:34,564
Put one of them down.
I aint putting the guns down!

433
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:37,890
Its just a tree.
Then leave it alone!

434
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:41,404
Aagh! See, I told you!
I told you! Leave it alone!

435
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,208
Run! Run! Run!

436
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:52,332
Shoot it, Bubba. Shoot it!
I cant! Its jammed! Its jammed!

437
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,851
Theres something.
Theres something coming out!

438
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:01,812
Where?
Out of the top.

439
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,904
Oh, my soul!

440
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:14,018
Throw me my gun, Bubba. Throw it.

441
00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:17,779
Sorry.

442
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:31,545
Is he dead?

443
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:34,554
Yeah, I think so. But look
at his face. Its changing.

444
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:37,829
And his hair...
his hair is all disappeared.

445
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:42,796
Whats that smell? You smell electricity?
Hes crackling. Were standing in water.

446
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:44,115
What is he, Burt?
Is he radioactive?

447
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:47,998
How the hell do I know?
Do I look like a nuclear genius?

448
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,241
Hes probably from Mars.
Or Jupiter.

449
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:52,641
Jupiter? I hope hes alone.

450
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:54,802
Theres somethin over there.
Where?

451
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:56,884
Right there.

452
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:05,968
What is it?

453
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:12,648
Buckaroo Banzai. Its the latest issue..

454
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:18,609
Rawhide, come in. Rawhide.

455
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:20,365
Rawhide..

456
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:24,573
Buckaroo, whats up? Where in Hades
are you? Im gettin a lot of static.

457
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,011
Yeah. Thats me.

458
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:32,658
Ive been ionised, but Im OK now.

459
00:38:32,784 --> 00:38:36,333
Listen, Im switching
on the homing beacon.

460
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:39,982
Mark two minute intervals... now.

461
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:44,500
Look, we got the overthruster. But someone
shanghaied the professor right from the conference.

462
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:49,181
Oh, the deuce you say.
What do you think?.

463
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,544
Dr Lizardo, maybe?
Yeah, Id put money on it..

464
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,234
That crate.
What crate?

465
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:58,153
The crate they shoved in that van..

466
00:38:58,275 --> 00:38:59,755
You and the guys...

467
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:03,473
go back to the house and dig up
everything you can on an outfit called

468
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:05,874
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

469
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:09,197
You got that?
Right. Yoyodyne. Were on it..

470
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:15,439
Hand me that tarp, will ya?
Lets cover this guy up.

471
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,475
Guy? What guy?
Hes got paws.

472
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,917
Now what?
Who are they?

473
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,805
Cover it up.

474
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,244
John Bigbooté, Officer.

475
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:37,966
Head of Operations,
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

476
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:42,054
Theres one of our birds.
That fella over there one of your birds, too?

477
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:44,167
The droid, you mean?

478
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:49,695
Doesnt look like anything Ive seen
before. I mean, Ive seen droids...

479
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,932
Nice night, huh?

480
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,866
That big thing over there attacked me.

481
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:10,786
Impossible. No, no, no, no, no, no.

482
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,459
Yeah! Its some kinda creature.
Theres part of it still stuck in the tree.

483
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:18,630
No, its a machine with 30foot
leather wings. I think its radioactive.

484
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:23,102
Three minutes since he last moved.
This is a fix. Something is happening.

485
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,030
Lets get somebody over there.

486
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:28,307
Al, you set up the grid
and get the last known coordinates.

487
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:31,270
Tommy, hop on the Marconi
and see if we got Blue Blazes

488
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:34,357
in a tenminute radius.
But no strike teams, Tommy, understand?

489
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:37,074
Im headed downstairs.
Keep everybody calm.

490
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,234
Hikitasan.
Buckaroo!

491
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:48,959
Repeating: intrastate outward band five.

492
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:52,362
Coded. Calling all Blue Blaze
irregulars in the Garden State.

493
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:57,087
Buckaroo... in trouble.
Will repeat coordinates..

494
00:40:57,209 --> 00:41:02,284
This is Scooter Lindley, Junior Blue Blaze
irregular 41 and a half. Hang on.

495
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:06,929
Dad! Dad! Buckaroos in trouble!
Say what?

496
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:10,491
Aliens from the Eighth Dimension.
Im seeing them now.

497
00:41:10,614 --> 00:41:12,367
You can see them now? Here?

498
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:16,126
Yeah, the three jerks driving this van.
Look at this. What is this?

499
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,576
Its your hand, Buckaroo.

500
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:23,091
No, no, no, no, its a formula.
Its an antidote of some kind.

501
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:26,532
Whatever that was in that phoney call
from the president gave me information,

502
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:30,782
some electrochemical message that
allows me to see what they really are.

503
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:35,058
What are they?
Lectroids from Planet Ten by way of the Eighth Dimension.

504
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:37,384
Mr Gomez?

505
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:40,022
I got a truck on the way to help mop things up.
Identification?

506
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:44,666
Or else this placell become a zoo,
not to mention a haven for gawkers.

507
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,940
Wait a minute. Now just a second.

508
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,791
Stay put. All of ya.
Sure thing.

509
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:53,187
Well go ahead and start breaking it down.

510
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:55,464
Dont touch it!

511
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:58,872
I got my own help on the way.
Now, thats an order.

512
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,829
Go find something to crack it open.

513
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,597
Theres a Harley in those bushes.

514
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:10,190
I want you to get out and go to the laboratory,
start working on this formula.

515
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:14,679
I want you to synthesise it.
Buckaroo! Give me the formula.

516
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:30,202
Oh, wow!

517
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:32,600
Peggy!

518
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:36,612
Shes not Peggy, Mrs Johnson.
Sois sage, mon amie..

519
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:40,172
No. Of course not. How could she be?

520
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:43,130
Any word from Buckaroo?
No, I thought he was with you guys.

521
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:47,376
No, hes not. Ah, Dr Zwibel,
Penny Priddy... Mrs Johnson.

522
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,207
Nice to meet you.
The fellas call me New Jersey.

523
00:42:56,502 --> 00:43:00,179
Well, where are they all going?
Bunk house. Off limits.

524
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:05,782
Again, John Gomez!

525
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:11,624
John OConnor,
theres a crowbar in the truck..

526
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:13,706
lll get it..

527
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:30,398
Destroy yourself, John Gant.

528
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:33,155
Set detonator..

529
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,511
Detonator set..

530
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:45,073
My most profuse apologies
to my homeland and loved ones..

531
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:48,915
John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head..

532
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:53,882
Perhaps John Parker will get through
with our message to Buckaroo Banzai..

533
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:56,522
I said back off! Now, dammit, I mean it!

534
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:59,688
Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Ugh!

535
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:05,003
Easy, friend. Ha, Buckaroo Banzai!

536
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,889
Hey!

537
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:12,330
Its Buckaroo Banzai! Get him!

538
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:24,176
Hustle up!

539
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:54,879
Scooter Lindley, Blue Blaze Irregular.

540
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:10,357
It is! It is Professor Hikita.
Were closing the gate. Please, step back!

541
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:13,602
Wheres Buckaroo?

542
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:29,280
We gotta have something for him.
Try a new cipher.

543
00:45:33,573 --> 00:45:35,963
Try a Gcipher.
Gcipher.

544
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:39,773
There...

545
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:40,925
Thats more like it.

546
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:45,975
Looks like weve accessed their restricted
data file. Could be highly revealing.

547
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:50,060
No sign of Buckaroo. The professor
just rode up saying something

548
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:54,094
about space monsters and wheres the
overthruster. Went straight to the lab.

549
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:55,975
Space monsters, my ass.

550
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,579
Hey, man, nice jacket.

551
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:11,382
Whats in the big pink box?

552
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,548
Hey, buddy. May I help you?

553
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,709
Hello! Buckaroo Banzai!?

554
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:23,223
You a messenger? What you got here?

555
00:46:23,354 --> 00:46:27,236
No, no, wait a minute.
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.

556
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:30,869
My name is John Parker.

557
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:32,556
Identify yourself, no?

558
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:35,874
Blue Blaze irregular Pinky Carruthers.

559
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,281
Sorry, John, everybody
needs see Buckaroo. Later.

560
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:41,232
Gino, run this down to the professor for me.

561
00:46:41,362 --> 00:46:42,919
Sounds like he's getting a little nervous.

562
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:47,355
This is queer. Look.
What's up? What you got?

563
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:52,326
All these people applied for social security cards
in the same town in New Jersey on exact same date.

564
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:53,645
New Jersey?

565
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:57,883
46 Yoyodyne employees,
Grover's Mill, New Jersey,

566
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,291
11138.

567
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:01,972
I got some pictures, boys.

568
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,662
It looks like a practical joke.
Check out these names:

569
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:12,381
John Yaya? John Parrot?
John Bigbooty?

570
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:15,980
Maybe not.
John Nolan? John O'Connor?

571
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:18,180
No way, José.

572
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,752
John Small Berries? It's a joke. Maybe
that's what Buckaroo was talking about.

573
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:27,074
No, Reno, there are no ages
and no places of birth.

574
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:31,479
Uh, Grover's Mill. Grover's Mill, 1938.
Why's that so familiar?

575
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:36,282
They all have the same first name.
John, John, John, John, John.

576
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:39,922
Somebody's playing games.
This is statistically impossible.

577
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:42,085
No, no, no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute, um...

578
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,124
November one. October.

579
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:47,004
30 days have September, April,
June, November. Short February.

580
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:50,525
And all the rest have 31. October 31st.

581
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:52,853
Halloween.

582
00:47:52,977 --> 00:47:54,776
Oh, um...

583
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,209
Don't you get it? Orson Welles.

584
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,937
You mean the guy from
the old wine commercials?

585
00:48:00,064 --> 00:48:04,026
Halloween, 1938. War of the Worlds,
that fake radio news broadcast.

586
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:07,505
that got everybody scared,
thinking real, live Martians...

587
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:11,144
were landing in Grover's Mill...

588
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:14,429
New Jersey.

589
00:48:14,554 --> 00:48:16,866
Then it all just turned out to be a hoax.

590
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:17,951
So?

591
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:24,315
So... maybe it wasn't a hoax.
Or, I mean, maybe it isn't a hoax.

592
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:35,607
If we don't find the overthruster,
Whorfin'll have us for supper.

593
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:39,089
Who says the damn
thing's even here?

594
00:48:57,588 --> 00:48:59,544
Come on! Come on!

595
00:49:16,802 --> 00:49:19,477
Who is he?
I don't know.

596
00:49:44,224 --> 00:49:47,104
All right, who's the wise guy?

597
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:52,418
I said, who's the wise guy?

598
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,919
It's locked.

599
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:14,876
John O'Connor, smash the window.

600
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:17,844
Why me, John Bigbooté?

601
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:24,124
It might be boobytrapped.

602
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,929
Oh.

603
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:34,259
Buckaroo!
Mrs Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.

604
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:36,454
Is Hikitasan here yet? Where's
the overthruster? Where's Penny?

605
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:40,787
Prof is in the lab with the overthruster. Penny's
in the right wing guest room. Everybody's safe and sound.

606
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,866
They're lectroids, Buckaroo.
From Planet Ten.

607
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:46,143
Planet Ten? How do you guys know?
It's all on the yellow record. Come on.

608
00:50:46,273 --> 00:50:47,627
Casper Lindley.
Reno.

609
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:51,716
Yellow record?
However, they didn't come here on a nonstop flight.

610
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:55,435
They blasted through the Eighth
Dimension in 1938 over in Grover's Mill.

611
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,554
Where there was a huge
electrical dimensional accident.

612
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:02,473
Some giant explosion. And they hypnotised
Orson Welles into covering it up.

613
00:51:02,605 --> 00:51:05,679
So, first he says there's
an invasion from Mars,

614
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:08,802
but then he says, no, no, no,
it's just a radioshow hoax.

615
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:10,124
Get it?
No.

616
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:13,405
Let's go.
Orson Welles? What about Yoyodyne? What about Dr Lizardo?

617
00:51:13,534 --> 00:51:16,935
That's what we're trying to tell you.
There's someone living inside him.

618
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:19,292
Buckaroo.
Pinky.

619
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:25,259
Put this on. Here, y'all put these on.
There's more in the box and there's one over there.

620
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,617
What's this?
It came with the record. It's like a 3D type thing.

621
00:51:28,745 --> 00:51:31,055
How am I supposed to know
he's from outer space?

622
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:34,659
This Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate
and delivers it all in a pink cake box.

623
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,100
What? What for?
We don't know. It wouldn't tell us.

624
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:40,910
It wants to talk to the head honcho.
Lights..

625
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:55,160
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.

626
00:51:56,367 --> 00:52:00,443
I am John Emdall from Planet Ten.

627
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:04,532
A common, grave danger
confronts both our worlds.

628
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:07,894
After a bloody reign of terror...
Hey, what is that?

629
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:11,170
..the hated leader of a military caste...

630
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:14,977
the selfproclaimed "Lord" John Whorfin,

631
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:17,902
a bloodthirsty butcher
as evil as your Hitler...

632
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:18,980
Oh, wow!

633
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:22,577
..was overthrown
by freedomloving forces...

634
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:27,182
tried and condemned, along with
several hundred of his followers,

635
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:32,629
to spend eternity in the formless void
of the Eighth Dimension.

636
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:35,396
Did you tell Penny that
Buckaroo's looking for her?

637
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:36,747
I looked in her room.
She wasn't there.

638
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:38,438
Who's Penny?
Where is she?

639
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,679
Will everybody shut up
so I can hear the rest of this thing?

640
00:52:41,802 --> 00:52:47,278
And now you, Buckaroo Banzai, have
unintentionally helped John Whorfin

641
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:50,726
with the success of your
oscillation overthruster.

642
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:56,804
For our intelligence warns us that
he intends to steal your overthruster.

643
00:52:56,933 --> 00:53:01,774
If he should attempt this,
we will have no choice

644
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:05,529
but to disrupt worldwide
electronic communications

645
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:10,056
and fire a particlebeam weapon
from your airspace

646
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:14,545
to Smolensk in the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics.

647
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:18,106
That an action that the Kremlin will most certainly
misinterpret as an American first strike.

648
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:25,073
They're already a little triggerhappy.
Stop John Whorfin before sunset.

649
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:29,990
If you fail, we will be forced
to help you destroy yourselves.

650
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,921
If it ain't one thing, it's another.
Lighten up.

651
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,716
End of discussion.

652
00:53:36,926 --> 00:53:39,521
Discussion? What discussion?

653
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,445
She gotta be kidding, right?
Vaporise the whole damn planet?

654
00:53:46,574 --> 00:53:51,777
You wanna roll those dice, Casper?
No, no, no, not me, man. No way.

655
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,256
Gents... we're going to Yoyodyne.

656
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,895
Rawhide, see how Hikitasan is
with that formula.

657
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:00,491
Billy, tell Sam to prep
the jet car for city driving.

658
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:02,821
What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

659
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:06,577
We keep it intimate. Call the Kolodny
Brothers. Call the Rug Suckers.

660
00:54:06,709 --> 00:54:09,669
Where are you going?
Get my guns.

661
00:54:11,192 --> 00:54:12,946
His guns?

662
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:16,593
Okay, okay, I'm a girl. I don't deny it.
I sneaked into your bedroom..

663
00:54:16,716 --> 00:54:19,516
I invaded your privacy.
I went through your personal belongings..

664
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:23,840
Mrs Johnson! I can never find anything around here...
I took a bath!

665
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:27,844
Penny, what's your problem?
Me! You! That picture!

666
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:32,360
I'm going crazy. Who's that girl, Buckaroo?
What's going on around here?

667
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:34,720
You drag me out of jail.
You're like Jerry Lewis.

668
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,572
You give me hope to carry on, but then
you leave me in the lurch

669
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:41,608
while you strap on your sixguns.
What do you want from me?

670
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,968
Who am I?
As near as I can figure...

671
00:54:44,457 --> 00:54:47,896
you had an identical twin sister and...

672
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:49,978
I married her.

673
00:54:50,944 --> 00:54:52,696
But that's over now.

674
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:57,743
And she's gone and that's about all
there is, really, to say about that.

675
00:55:08,236 --> 00:55:13,554
We don't know what to expect here.
It disagrees with all the standard pictures.

676
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,601
It's producing a magnetic force.

677
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:20,034
No, no. I'm wrong!

678
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:32,852
Hey!

679
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:38,409
Oh, tell me I'm dreaming.

680
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,412
Ow!
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

681
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:44,854
Buckaroo! Sorry. Sam's dead.
Sam?

682
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:47,217
Someone broke into the jetcar.
Things are going haywire over at the lab.

683
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:49,303
Wait here. I'll be right back.

684
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:01,226
Oh, boy.

685
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:14,406
He's dead. Spread out.
They can't be very far off.

686
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:19,687
Okay. Tommy, check the biomedical labs.
Reno, take physics. Jersey, go with Reno.

687
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:21,930
Where you going?
Engineering.

688
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:25,897
Cowboy! Hold your gun
in front of you, man.

689
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:28,533
Oh, I see. I got that. OK.
It's cool.

690
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:42,068
Buckaroo, behind you!

691
00:56:51,316 --> 00:56:54,754
You... you OK?
Yeah. Just let me catch my breath.

692
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,558
Professor went down into the purification
vent. He's got the overthruster.

693
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,640
All right.

694
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,808
Why is there a watermelon there?

695
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:16,207
I'll tell you later.

696
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,073
Buckaroo?

697
00:57:52,805 --> 00:57:54,477
Rawhide?

698
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:57,166
Anybody?

699
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:26,466
Here, young lady. The overthruster.

700
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,871
Here, put this in your purse.

701
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:36,554
Get out of here!

702
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,192
Where's your overthruster?

703
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:43,279
Hikitasan!

704
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,837
Nice morning, huh?

705
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,736
It's just making my legs asleep.

706
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:10,460
What the hell is wrong with him?
I don't know. I don't know. Are you cold?

707
00:59:11,065 --> 00:59:12,464
It's my spine.

708
00:59:19,232 --> 00:59:23,307
What're you still doing on this floor?
I think it's cos I can't move my legs.

709
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:26,071
Ooh, damn!

710
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,400
What is it? Apache?
Arachtoid.

711
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,196
Oh, spiders. So I was right, huh?

712
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:36,601
We got the guy, Rawhide.
Sucker only tried...

713
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:40,365
Any antidote for these things?
No. Not at all.

714
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:45,247
Come over here.
Does that mean you're on our side?

715
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,931
That's right.

716
00:59:49,855 --> 00:59:54,569
Man! Those things
pack a mean wallop, huh?

717
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,536
What are y'all looking at?

718
00:59:58,501 --> 01:00:02,258
You're on the clock. Let's saddle up, huh?

719
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,227
Hey, man, they're stealing my helicopter!

720
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:17,829
They've got Penny!

721
01:00:17,956 --> 01:00:20,713
She has the overthruster.

722
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:23,754
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

723
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:30,523
It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai per se,
Mr President. It's his men.

724
01:00:30,648 --> 01:00:34,119
Foreigners, some of 'em.
Or their names have been changed.

725
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,882
Their true backgrounds
are shrouded in secrecy!

726
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:43,136
Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car
belongs in the hands of Defense.

727
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:47,458
I mean, if the Banzai Institute
doesn't want to sell it to us,

728
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,776
then we're gonna have
to take it from them!

729
01:00:49,902 --> 01:00:52,895
In national interest, of course.

730
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,225
Come in.

731
01:00:56,347 --> 01:01:01,299
Excuse me, Mr President, World Watch One.
Directincoming transmission.

732
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:02,784
Yeah.

733
01:01:08,556 --> 01:01:10,914
Hello, Mr President, I know your back is killing you,.

734
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:14,955
but I have a developing situation here
and I must speak frankly..

735
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:18,520
Buckaroo...
Secretary of Defense McKinley

736
01:01:18,644 --> 01:01:22,117
and my National Security Advisor
Smirnoff, are visiting me,

737
01:01:22,247 --> 01:01:24,559
but I have no secrets from them.

738
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:28,002
Well, something has reared
its ugly head in outer space, Mr President,.

739
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:30,693
and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire..

740
01:01:30,815 --> 01:01:33,613
We have reason to believe
that there are vicious red aliens.

741
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:37,128
walking freely among us,
posing as the owners and operators.

742
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:39,217
of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems..

743
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:44,862
Yoyodyne Propulsion... the people
working on our Truncheon Bomber?

744
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:49,379
In the hands of foreign nationals?
Excuse me, Mr President. Time is short..

745
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,109
In order to prevent
John Whorfin's escape,.

746
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:56,830
my comrades are at this very moment
taking up a geostationary position.

747
01:01:56,955 --> 01:02:00,074
over New Jersey.
This situation is explosive..

748
01:02:00,197 --> 01:02:02,558
Who the hell is that?
Explosive, what are you saying man?

749
01:02:02,654 --> 01:02:04,477
Some kind of race war in New Jersey?

750
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,921
No, Mr President, no..

751
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:09,752
This man as you call him is not
a human being at all, but is, in fact,.

752
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:13,846
a black lectroid named John Parker
from the very same Planet Ten..

753
01:02:13,968 --> 01:02:17,600
And his spaceship is, at this moment,
anchored above Yoyodyne..

754
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,642
Yoyodyne.

755
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:21,606
Buckaroo, my good friend...
That's it!.

756
01:02:21,734 --> 01:02:25,412
These red creatures, they must
somehow give off the bacteria.

757
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:30,331
We breathe it. It swims up our nose
into our cerebral cortex

758
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:33,773
where it talks to our brain cells.

759
01:02:33,903 --> 01:02:36,816
Tells us to see exactly
what they want us to see.

760
01:02:36,945 --> 01:02:38,346
Electric brainwashing.

761
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,026
Diabolical. They got us so confused...

762
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:43,109
Buckaroo, I don't know what to say.

763
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:47,465
Lectroids from Planet Ten?.

764
01:02:47,594 --> 01:02:50,428
Nuclear extortion?.

765
01:02:50,557 --> 01:02:52,753
A girl named John?.

766
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:54,551
Buckaroo, Lectroid Wing Commander..

767
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,276
Excuse me, Mr President,
I have to go talk to the hornet's nest.

768
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:01,401
Good God.

769
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:05,885
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai,
I'd say commit the man.

770
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:07,567
Get me SAC Headquarters, Omaha,

771
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:11,446
NORAD and the Strategic Space Command.
I want some hard data on that cloud.

772
01:03:11,572 --> 01:03:14,691
John, get out in the field.
Stick your beak into this one.

773
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:19,647
What is this thing made of?
Cobalt and electricity.

774
01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:24,140
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.

775
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:26,335
World Watch One.

776
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,819
Buckaroo.

777
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:32,905
It's Whorfin.

778
01:03:35,871 --> 01:03:37,306
Dr Banzai?.

779
01:03:39,354 --> 01:03:42,394
Yes, this is Emilio Lizardo.

780
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:44,713
Maybe you don't remember me.

781
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:49,316
Ah. I'm flattered.
We know the same people.

782
01:03:50,403 --> 01:03:52,998
Yeah. In fact, one of them
is with me right now.

783
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,082
Your associate...

784
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,563
Dr Penny Priddy.

785
01:03:57,688 --> 01:03:58,963
Doctor?

786
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,606
May I pass along my congratulations

787
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:05,409
for your great
interdimensional breakthrough.

788
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:10,406
I'm sure in the miserable annals of
the Earth, you will be duly enshrined.

789
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:16,011
However... Miss Priddy claims

790
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,864
to be unable to solve my problem

791
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:22,059
and provide me with
the crucial missing circuit

792
01:04:22,188 --> 01:04:23,747
for my overthruster!.

793
01:04:24,348 --> 01:04:26,306
He hasn't found it. He hasn't found it.

794
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:28,867
Maybe you can convince her to try.

795
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,790
John O'Connor!

796
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:34,268
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget about me!

797
01:04:34,397 --> 01:04:37,914
They'll never break me. Never!
Penny, get off the phone..

798
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,797
Dr Lizardo, really what does she know
about an overthruster? She's not a scientist..

799
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:45,474
Shall we play...
a Penny for your thoughts?

800
01:04:47,888 --> 01:04:50,847
Maybe you can come in her place, huh?

801
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,930
Yoyodyne, Banzai. You know the address.

802
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:57,570
Come alone and bring your overthruster!.

803
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:03,892
He'll come. I know his type.

804
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,330
Take her to the pit!

805
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:08,419
Go, Bigbooty!

806
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:14,577
Use more honey!
Find out what she knows.

807
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:18,342
These breathing devices Hikitasan has cooked up
will enable you to see them

808
01:05:18,471 --> 01:05:23,596
as they really are, as I've been seeing
them since yesterday as Lectroids.

809
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:26,470
In our eyes, they're not very pretty.

810
01:05:27,278 --> 01:05:29,475
Nothing personal, John Parker.

811
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:36,965
If we blow this today...
there ain't no tomorrow.

812
01:05:37,086 --> 01:05:40,604
We have only 240 minutes remaining.

813
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,962
Right. I'm working under the assumption
that Penny still has the overthruster,

814
01:05:44,091 --> 01:05:47,722
but this psycho Whorfin doesn't
know that. So that'll be my job.

815
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:50,085
To get her and it back in one piece.

816
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:55,295
Your objective is to 86 Whorfin.
You know your two strike groups.

817
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:56,978
Apache group, that's you, Reno.

818
01:05:57,102 --> 01:06:01,496
Chaparral group, that's you, Perfect
Tommy. Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

819
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:06,498
It's my guess that no human being
has ever been inside the place.

820
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:11,782
So who knows what we're gonna find
there. Top priority is the overthruster.

821
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:15,225
Without it, Whorfin
can't get off this planet.

822
01:06:15,356 --> 01:06:18,906
This homing device will probably
make it very easy to find.

823
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:21,430
And maybe a lot harder to get back.

824
01:06:22,281 --> 01:06:24,112
Strategic Space Command now reports

825
01:06:24,242 --> 01:06:27,954
all the surveillance satellite
communication jammed.

826
01:06:28,086 --> 01:06:30,442
Jammed? By who? Who by?

827
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:33,208
Possible atmospheric conditions, sir.

828
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:35,321
Solar.
Solar?.

829
01:06:35,451 --> 01:06:39,687
Intelligence confirms that Soviets
are having the same problem.

830
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:42,410
Should we be on Code Red?

831
01:06:42,537 --> 01:06:45,132
We go to Code Red,
the Russians go to Code Red.

832
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:47,568
No sense going off halfcocked, Mr President.

833
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,012
I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai
has never been wrong before.

834
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:53,254
The man's been through solid matter,
for crying out loud.

835
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:55,174
Who knows what happened to his brain.

836
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:57,344
Maybe it scrambled his molecules.

837
01:06:57,469 --> 01:07:00,701
All I'm saying is,
Mr President, let's not panic.

838
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,025
What's happening?

839
01:07:06,115 --> 01:07:09,189
Electromagnetic pulsar.

840
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:15,752
Russians just gone to
Defense Condition Two, sir.

841
01:07:15,882 --> 01:07:17,283
We've no choice, then.

842
01:07:17,844 --> 01:07:20,964
Mr President, I am a soldier,
and I'm a damn good one.

843
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,921
I've got enough decorations
to snap a Christmas tree.

844
01:07:24,049 --> 01:07:28,887
All I'm trying to say is and I hope
I speak for everyone in this room...

845
01:07:29,013 --> 01:07:32,052
is that I am scared.

846
01:07:32,174 --> 01:07:34,690
I'm barely holding my fudge right now.

847
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:39,212
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl,
General, and pull yourself together.

848
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:43,302
I'm glad someone has
the balls to face facts.

849
01:07:49,629 --> 01:07:52,020
Don't embarrass us.
Have I ever?

850
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,270
Give me 30 minutes,
then come in and mop up.

851
01:08:08,883 --> 01:08:10,840
Shut up!

852
01:08:21,534 --> 01:08:24,209
I've had enough of you, Penny Priddy!

853
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:34,133
Well... Mrs Johnson, thank you.

854
01:08:34,263 --> 01:08:38,499
It's certainly food for thought.

855
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:42,781
No answer at the Kremlin, sir.
Just dead silence.

856
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,946
Then I guess the moment is upon us.

857
01:08:46,073 --> 01:08:47,957
Here you go, Mr President.

858
01:08:48,053 --> 01:08:50,837
The Presidential Emergency Action Document.

859
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:52,756
For your eyes only.

860
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:54,835
John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

861
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,874
You know, on second thought, maybe
we should think this through a bit more

862
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:01,475
so that future generations
of Americans will...

863
01:09:02,325 --> 01:09:03,474
Oh, wow.

864
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:09,165
"Declaration of War: The Short Form."

865
01:09:23,221 --> 01:09:26,900
Bring that thing right through the gate.
Straight ahead, straight ahead, come on.

866
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:33,826
Blacks... are on this planet!

867
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,585
Here, in New Jersey!

868
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:41,025
Coming to destroy us!

869
01:09:41,154 --> 01:09:42,714
We must act!

870
01:09:42,837 --> 01:09:45,751
Escape or die!

871
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:48,831
We must work faster

872
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:52,594
to finish the great vehicle itself,

873
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:57,119
so we can enter the Eighth Dimension

874
01:09:57,247 --> 01:10:01,209
and free our trapped comrades!

875
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:04,166
So we can return home

876
01:10:04,294 --> 01:10:07,844
and seize power once again!

877
01:10:09,898 --> 01:10:14,212
What is the greatest joy?
The joy of duty!

878
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:18,896
Louder!
The joy of duty!

879
01:10:19,026 --> 01:10:22,303
History is made at night.

880
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:27,347
Character is what you are in the dark!

881
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:30,626
We must work while the clock,
she's ticking.

882
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:36,670
We hide, they seek!
Death to the Black Lectroids!.

883
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,713
Where are we going?
Planet Ten!

884
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:42,039
When?
Real soon!

885
01:10:49,089 --> 01:10:52,480
Come on over here. Bring it this way!

886
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,804
This way!

887
01:10:57,935 --> 01:10:59,688
Now park it.

888
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:03,289
There's no overthruster!

889
01:11:06,502 --> 01:11:09,781
Get him here! Get him outta there!
I wanna see his face!

890
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:13,623
It's not here!

891
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:16,707
Take him to the shock tower.

892
01:11:31,922 --> 01:11:35,359
The equations. Solve them.

893
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:40,277
Enter your data on this keypad.
And you better be right.

894
01:11:40,408 --> 01:11:44,244
The shock tower is a lie detector.

895
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:47,650
Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge

896
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:50,927
to your auditory meatus.

897
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,494
Open circuit.
So?.

898
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:59,662
You're not getting jack from me until
you let Penny out of this junkyard.

899
01:11:59,784 --> 01:12:03,335
Curse you, Banzai!
Don't you realise what are you saying?

900
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:06,860
Your whole planet is gonna be destroyed
and you sit here wasting time?

901
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,425
Time? I got nothing but time.

902
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:17,274
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife.

903
01:12:17,396 --> 01:12:21,110
Doomed is your soul
and damned is your life.

904
01:12:22,282 --> 01:12:23,920
Buzz off.

905
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:28,561
Bigbooty...

906
01:12:28,686 --> 01:12:31,042
more power to him.

907
01:12:31,168 --> 01:12:33,603
Bigbooté.

908
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,564
I want my missing circuit, now!

909
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:12,714
Is there something I can help you with?
Is Buckaroo upstairs?

910
01:13:12,839 --> 01:13:15,481
Hello, Mr Secretary.

911
01:13:15,602 --> 01:13:16,638
Where is he?

912
01:13:18,564 --> 01:13:21,923
That won't work either.
Porco Giuda!.

913
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:25,603
Hey, Banzai.

914
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:30,768
Take a look at your girlfriend.

915
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,536
Devo lavorare con persone idiota!.

916
01:13:41,623 --> 01:13:46,415
She'll live... but only for a while.

917
01:13:46,546 --> 01:13:49,699
And she won't enjoy it.

918
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:52,470
Only you can save her from a fate

919
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,710
even worse than that of
your friend, Mr Rawhide.

920
01:13:55,834 --> 01:13:59,386
Missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

921
01:13:59,517 --> 01:14:01,668
Bigbooty...

922
01:14:01,798 --> 01:14:04,154
activate your probes.

923
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:25,052
Slow this sucker down.
I'll handle these birds.

924
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:35,055
You gentlemen have a telephone? You wanna jump
on the horn and get Mr John Bigboot.

925
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:36,460
It's Bigbooté.

926
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:40,661
Oh, hell, if you wanna do anything
nowadays, you gotta do it yourself.

927
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:43,749
What is your name?
John Yaya.

928
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:47,104
John Yaya, huh? And you are?

929
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,190
"John Small Berries."

930
01:15:09,331 --> 01:15:12,212
He's down there. I feel it.
We're not...

931
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:26,622
It's a nest.
Birds nest. People don't nest.

932
01:15:26,745 --> 01:15:28,179
Red Lectroid.

933
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,196
Don't touch it. It might be a bomb.

934
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:54,519
Nah, it's a toy.

935
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:02,807
Sit down!
Sir? Hey, that area's restricted.

936
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:06,210
Yeah? Not to me!

937
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:15,736
This I know. This I know.
And I love Whorfin too..

938
01:16:19,986 --> 01:16:22,741
What is this place?
It's a bivouac. They sleep here.

939
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:26,385
Can they all shoot stingers?
You better believe it.

940
01:16:26,511 --> 01:16:28,582
Lizardo. Which way?
Over there.

941
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:31,148
You sure?
Believe it.

942
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:33,232
Just once.

943
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:08,499
Where...?
Shh.

944
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,102
What's going on? Where are we?

945
01:17:13,227 --> 01:17:15,869
It's a bivouac, man. They sleep here.

946
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,800
What's happening?

947
01:17:33,922 --> 01:17:36,440
John Isaac, get the boy! Andiamo!.

948
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:40,083
Bigbooty! Go down to the pit. Kill the girl!

949
01:17:43,211 --> 01:17:44,965
Scooter! Where are you?

950
01:17:55,019 --> 01:17:57,775
Hey, somebody turn off
that gosh dang klaxon!

951
01:17:57,903 --> 01:18:02,740
Work. Work. Work..

952
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:07,731
There are monkey boys in the facility..

953
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:09,842
You are secure..

954
01:18:10,888 --> 01:18:11,868
Do not panic..

955
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:17,307
John Emdall must die..

956
01:18:18,396 --> 01:18:20,795
Lord Whorfin must live..

957
01:18:22,602 --> 01:18:23,478
Work..

958
01:18:23,722 --> 01:18:25,042
Work..

959
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:26,717
Work..

960
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:55,941
Sorry. I'm sorry.

961
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:57,502
Sidney.
Buckaroo!

962
01:18:57,628 --> 01:19:00,623
It's good to see you, pal. You got a pistol?

963
01:19:00,751 --> 01:19:02,583
Yeah.

964
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:07,105
What are you gonna use?

965
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:10,592
Where are we?
I hate to tell you.

966
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:13,877
Where are we going?

967
01:19:15,803 --> 01:19:17,761
This way.

968
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:27,684
Get over here..

969
01:19:27,813 --> 01:19:31,649
Keep your noses to the grindstone..

970
01:19:31,776 --> 01:19:34,244
The greatest joy is the joy of duty..

971
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:38,378
Work. Work. Work..

972
01:19:39,061 --> 01:19:42,374
Monkey boys are feeble.
Lord Whorfin is supreme!.

973
01:19:42,504 --> 01:19:48,060
Bigboot! Bigboot! Hold on a minute,
I wanna talk to you.

974
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:53,343
What the hell's the matter with you?
You deaf? I said I wanna talk to you!

975
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:16,965
Jesus!

976
01:20:17,331 --> 01:20:21,168
What the hell is going on here,
Bigboot? Where's my bomber?

977
01:20:21,293 --> 01:20:26,212
Bigbooté. John O'Connor,
put the slug on the track.

978
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:29,172
I don't give a flying handshake
what your name is!

979
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,499
I'm here to see a bomber!
This sure ain't it.

980
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:36,015
Let's just go back upstairs to my office.

981
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:38,421
Talk about this like
two reasonable beings.

982
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,825
You listen to me. Your private life,
that's your own concern.

983
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:46,150
But I'm here to see a bomber
and I'm damn sure gonna see it now!

984
01:20:46,272 --> 01:20:50,234
Look at this place. Don't you have
any pride? It looks like a damn pigsty!

985
01:20:51,678 --> 01:20:56,357
It's not my goddamn planet.
Understand, monkey boy?

986
01:20:57,282 --> 01:21:00,755
Let's get outta here, O'Connor.
But Whorfin said we could kill her.

987
01:21:29,988 --> 01:21:31,899
You owe me one, Buck.

988
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:41,996
It's not over yet.

989
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:45,911
I may be down but I'm not out.

990
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:54,600
What is that? Don't pick it up. No.

991
01:21:57,969 --> 01:21:59,530
Penny.

992
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,483
How's she doing?

993
01:22:02,612 --> 01:22:05,493
I don't know.
There's no overthruster.

994
01:22:05,614 --> 01:22:07,207
Buckaroo Banzai!
What?

995
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:09,692
There is little time!

996
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:13,609
You better come quickly
if your planet is still important to you.

997
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:17,054
Leave her to me.
You take care of business.

998
01:22:17,904 --> 01:22:19,498
Thanks.

999
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,618
Go. Go.
Right.

1000
01:22:24,469 --> 01:22:27,828
Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
He's flown the coop.

1001
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:29,625
Is the girl dead?
Yes!

1002
01:22:29,754 --> 01:22:32,509
Then sound the call to board the ship.

1003
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:35,198
Without the crucial missing circuit,
we'll never make it!

1004
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:39,395
They're only monkey boys! We can still
crush them here on Earth, Lord Whorfin!

1005
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:42,356
No. It's time to go home.

1006
01:22:42,484 --> 01:22:46,081
Bigbooty, you carry my overthruster.

1007
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:49,042
John O'Connor...

1008
01:22:49,168 --> 01:22:51,524
you stick by my side.

1009
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:03,856
The great vehicle itself
is now in final boarding state..

1010
01:23:03,981 --> 01:23:06,371
What is that?.

1011
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:11,139
It's a troop ship. Lord Whorfin..

1012
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:19,309
Massacre them without quarter!

1013
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:40,120
Tell the flight attendants to close
the doors and prepare for a crosscheck.

1014
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:54,818
If you are not inside the great vehicle
itself, you have missed the boat..

1015
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:02,060
We are go for launch.
Do not obstruct the great vehicle..

1016
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:05,664
Do not take to the floor..

1017
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:09,467
Lord Whorfin will return
for all those left behind..

1018
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:14,795
Clear the great vehicle. Voltage is rising.
Electromagnetic field is rising..

1019
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,240
John O'Connor! Install my overthruster!

1020
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:26,640
..all carryon baggage
overhead and secure..

1021
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:28,802
Electromagnetic field...

1022
01:24:28,926 --> 01:24:33,721
What is this?
It looks like one of our thermopods.

1023
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:35,807
But it's a very bad design.

1024
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:43,490
Your tray tables are secure, and your
seat backs in the full upright position..

1025
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:46,692
Your overthruster
is in place, Lord Whorfin.

1026
01:24:46,821 --> 01:24:48,973
It won't work! It won't work!

1027
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:52,061
Shut up, John Bigbooty, you coward!

1028
01:24:52,184 --> 01:24:55,702
You're the weakest individual
I ever know!

1029
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:58,665
We are cooking. Over..

1030
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:04,274
Get away from that, boy,
or I'll drink your blood!

1031
01:25:06,757 --> 01:25:10,274
What you got there, son?
That's not real, is it?

1032
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:13,952
Get 'em up.

1033
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:18,762
H2 tank pressurisation, OK.
We're go for launch..

1034
01:25:18,884 --> 01:25:24,600
John Many Jars, establish overthruster
beam red. Over. Activate oscillator..

1035
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:29,129
Pace accelerator's shorting out!

1036
01:25:29,253 --> 01:25:31,974
John O'Connor! My overthruster!

1037
01:25:40,422 --> 01:25:43,973
Wait! Don't leave! Don't leave!

1038
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,859
This is vacuum cylinder three..

1039
01:25:52,952 --> 01:25:56,424
If he can't connect the dots,
they never gonna penetrate.

1040
01:25:59,317 --> 01:26:03,756
Cabin fluid valves were closed.
Problem is corrected. Over..

1041
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,836
What is that?

1042
01:26:04,961 --> 01:26:08,195
Is OK. No worry.
Is an insulating liquid.

1043
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:10,794
Full speed ahead!.

1044
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:14,524
May I remind you to fasten your seat belts

1045
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:17,484
and extinguish all smoking material.

1046
01:26:17,611 --> 01:26:21,084
We haven't a chance!
Your overthruster's for shit!

1047
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:23,684
One more word out of you, Bigbooty...

1048
01:26:23,816 --> 01:26:26,969
Bigbooté! Té! Té!

1049
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,062
Welcome aboard, Banzai. You're next..

1050
01:26:35,185 --> 01:26:37,302
Let's go home.

1051
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:47,461
The wall is softening..

1052
01:26:49,035 --> 01:26:52,509
Inertial overtones obtaining command.
Oh, no..

1053
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:09,491
Danger! Danger! We do not have
crossover. Negative mass is spreading..

1054
01:27:16,137 --> 01:27:20,258
We're not in the Eighth Dimension.
We are over New Jersey..

1055
01:27:20,379 --> 01:27:22,052
All is not lost...

1056
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:24,742
Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

1057
01:27:25,983 --> 01:27:27,305
Jettison!.

1058
01:27:27,425 --> 01:27:31,104
So sorry, gentlemen,
but I must dump the excess baggage..

1059
01:27:35,872 --> 01:27:38,627
Arrivederci, Banzai!.

1060
01:27:40,275 --> 01:27:44,635
Where's the power?
I'm a diplomat! I failed flight school.

1061
01:27:45,078 --> 01:27:47,116
What do we do, jumpstart it?

1062
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:15,374
Rocket stabiliser.

1063
01:28:15,502 --> 01:28:17,460
What this?

1064
01:28:19,305 --> 01:28:21,263
Looks like a gun.

1065
01:28:26,071 --> 01:28:28,303
John Parker, take this wheel.

1066
01:28:31,475 --> 01:28:35,187
Right, just... just hold onto that.
It flies like a truck.

1067
01:28:35,317 --> 01:28:37,196
Good. What is a truck?

1068
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,202
Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin..

1069
01:29:01,418 --> 01:29:03,489
Thermopod on our tail. Over..

1070
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:07,013
Banzai! Oh, so you wanna play games?

1071
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:12,016
Let's just stabilise her?
Wanna play hideandseek? Huh?.

1072
01:29:12,147 --> 01:29:17,623
OK. OK. Start left. Go left. More, more,
more, more. Left, left. Left! I said left!

1073
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:20,393
This is left!
I mean my left. Go your right.

1074
01:29:20,513 --> 01:29:21,709
Go.

1075
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:24,110
Feet, do your stuff!

1076
01:29:24,236 --> 01:29:26,115
Faster! He's gaining..

1077
01:29:26,237 --> 01:29:31,636
More, more, more. Lock in, lock in,
lock in. Now dive, dive, dive, dive, dive.

1078
01:29:31,762 --> 01:29:34,518
Whorfin... sayonara..

1079
01:29:36,685 --> 01:29:42,209
Banzai! I'll see you in hell!

1080
01:29:43,492 --> 01:29:45,608
We've got him!

1081
01:29:46,493 --> 01:29:48,850
Pull up!
It's stuck!

1082
01:29:55,219 --> 01:29:57,497
John Whorfin... destroyed.

1083
01:29:58,943 --> 01:30:01,060
Deactivate particle beam.

1084
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:05,339
Tracking 000.

1085
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:52,016
I thought you bought it.

1086
01:30:52,144 --> 01:30:54,456
Yeah, me too. Where's Penny?
At the bus.

1087
01:30:54,587 --> 01:30:56,624
New Jersey helped me bring her back.

1088
01:30:56,749 --> 01:30:59,218
How is she?
He said he'd pull her through.

1089
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:02,025
Quite a guy, if you want my opinion.

1090
01:31:02,912 --> 01:31:04,506
You give me that gizmo

1091
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:09,918
and I'll give you a brand new
crisp $20 bill. Huh?

1092
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,355
All right, I'll tell you what...
Hey, Scooter! Fall in.

1093
01:31:20,486 --> 01:31:23,242
This what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

1094
01:31:24,529 --> 01:31:28,970
Scooter... you got his job.
All right!.

1095
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:32,089
Wanna ride with me in the jet car?
Wow! You know.

1096
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:34,488
But I have to ask my dad first.

1097
01:31:35,097 --> 01:31:37,852
OK, you ask your dad, I'll wash up.

1098
01:31:42,144 --> 01:31:43,703
Aw.

1099
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:51,145
I did all I could.

1100
01:31:54,353 --> 01:31:58,314
Buckaroo, President's on line one. Calling about is
everything OK with the alien space cloud,

1101
01:31:58,436 --> 01:32:00,668
or should he go ahead
and destroy Russia?

1102
01:32:00,797 --> 01:32:03,598
Tell him yes on one and no on two.

1103
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:08,154
Which was "yes"?
To destroy Russia or number two?

1104
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,810
Penny.

1105
01:33:24,464 --> 01:33:26,420
Careful..

1106
01:33:28,946 --> 01:33:30,904
You're all right..

1107
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,223
You look awful.

1108
01:33:36,351 --> 01:33:41,305
You don't exactly light up
a party yourself... Penny Priddy.

1109
01:33:52,325 --> 01:33:54,887
So what? Big deal!

1110
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,322

OF BUCKAROO BANZAl
