1
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,575
Our fight is directed against those that

2
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,949
want to keep women
in an inferior position.

3
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:30,982
Oh, I'd change my position
for yours any day.

4
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:34,862
That's what I said to myself
as I sat there in your comfortable parlor.

5
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,544
But do you reproach me
for having a little money?

6
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:38,923
Oh, certainly not.

7
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:43,779
It's the dearest wish of my heart
to do something with it for others.

8
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,221
Don't you believe in
the coming of a better day?

9
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,377
That it's possible to do something
for the human race?

10
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:52,616
Well...

11
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,311
What strikes me most, Miss Olive,

12
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:57,261
is that the human race
has just got to bear its troubles.

13
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,876
Why, that's what men say

14
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:03,297
to keep women in the position
they have made for them.

15
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:07,049
The position of women is nothing
but to make fools of men.

16
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:13,194
- Don't you believe in our emancipation?
- I'll tell you after the meeting.

17
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,878
Your cousin looks like a genius,
my dear.

18
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,842
He's only a distant cousin.
He's a lawyer from Mississippi.

19
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:21,890
He left his mother and sisters behind,

20
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,344
and he's come to try
to make his living in New York.

21
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,266
He's not in sympathy, I'm afraid.

22
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:31,908
Well, I've often found that people
are only waiting for the light.

23
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,312
Oh, there's our guest of honor.

24
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:37,509
Miss Birdseye,
what a pleasure to see you.

25
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:45,095
Excuse me. May I ask you,
who is that lady?

26
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:48,422
Mrs. Farrinder is the leader,
and you might say the apostle,

27
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,976
of the movement
to emancipate the female sex.

28
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,096
Oh, I see.

29
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,111
- How nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:56,934
Matthias Pardon,
representing the press.

31
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,723
Transcript, don't you know.

32
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,929
I'm hoping Mrs. Farrinder
will give an address.

33
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:04,415
I'll write it up for the Transcript.
You know, there is a great interest

34
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,495
in the movement
among the public at large,

35
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,349
and I'm here in the service of
the public at large.

36
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:11,836
Pro bono publico.

37
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:37,245
I beg your pardon.
Are you acquainted with the lioness?

38
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,771
I mean, the renowned Mrs. Farrinder.

39
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,910
Now, has she convinced you
that women are superior to men?

40
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:45,434
I guess I know more
about women than she does.

41
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,679
I'm a doctor. Prance is the name.

42
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,667
I'm Basil Ransom. Hello.

43
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,706
Men and women are all the same to me.

44
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,845
There's room for improvement
in both sexes.

45
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,890
Neither of them is up to the standard.

46
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:04,091
- Mrs. Tarrant. Dr. Tarrant.
- Miss Birdseye.

47
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,977
- Verena, my dear.
- Hello, Miss Birdseye.

48
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,528
The Tarrants.

49
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,042
Dr. Tarrant, he calls himself.
He's a mesmeric healer.

50
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:16,154
Miraculous cures.

51
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,578
If I might request
a few moments silence.

52
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,233
I'll start her up.

53
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,056
Quietly.

54
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,640
Quietly.

55
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,582
It will come, my dear child.

56
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:45,557
- Is she asleep?
- The spirit will come.

57
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,729
Let it gather.

58
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,221
Let it come.

59
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,126
The light.

60
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:59,517
The tide is rising.

61
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,261
Is rising.

62
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:09,784
I feel... I hear a calling.

63
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:12,307
A calling for help.

64
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,616
Uncounted millions have lived
only to be tortured.

65
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:20,856
To be crucified.

66
00:07:21,852 --> 00:07:24,983
Ages of oppression
have rolled over them.

67
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:29,051
But the day of their delivery has dawned.

68
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:33,335
This is the only sacred cause.

69
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:37,625
This is the great, the just revolution.

70
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,840
It must triumph.
It must sweep everything before it.

71
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,169
It will be the greatest change
the world has seen.

72
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,371
And the names of those
who have helped to show the way

73
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:52,566
and lead the squadrons will be
the brightest in the tables of fame...

74
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,481
Do you know my cousin,
Miss Chancellor?

75
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,391
I can't say I know her,

76
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:01,653
but I guess I know
others like her pretty well.

77
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:05,681
When I look at the world and at
the state that men have brought it to,

78
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:10,225
I confess, I say to myself,
"Well, if women had fixed it this way,

79
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:13,176
I should like to know
what men would think of it. "

80
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,805
- They pretend to admire us...
- Do you like it?

81
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,755
What she's saying?

82
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:24,205
Nah. But I suppose she's been
taught all that by her daddy.

83
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:28,205
I say that if this is the best
they can do by themselves,

84
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,791
they had better let us come in a little
and see what we can do.

85
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:36,716
We couldn't possibly
make it worse, could we?

86
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,724
There is a brutal element in the world
which tramples down the feeble

87
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,935
and treads down the weak.

88
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:47,410
I stand in a place of peace and beauty,

89
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:53,073
and I look into a wilderness
of poverty and ignorance and misery.

90
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:57,133
The world is drenched in blood...

91
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,124
I guess I've heard it all before.

92
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,107
But she looks so pretty
when she says it.

93
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:04,946
I think she looks anemic
and she probably eats too much candy.

94
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,669
Well, I've got work to do.

95
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,779
I don't want the gentlemen doctors
to get ahead of me.

96
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:12,429
Oh, nobody'd ever get ahead
of you, Dr. Prance, I'm very sure.

97
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,311
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

98
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,592
I'm only a girl.

99
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,592
A simple American girl.
And of course I haven't seen much

100
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,349
and there's a great deal of life
I don't know anything about,

101
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,337
but there are some things that I feel.

102
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,855
They are in my ears
in the stillness of the night,

103
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,612
and before my face
in the visions of the darkness.

104
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,511
Let us remember in our trials
and discouragements,

105
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:41,359
that if our lives are true,
we walk with angels.

106
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,944
If we trust one another,

107
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,758
if we are true and gentle and kind,

108
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,671
those regal ideas that struggle
for liberty will come forth

109
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:53,485
and spread their wings to soar high.

110
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,696
You speak well, and no wonder,
for you speak in a great cause.

111
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,846
Isn't she wonderful?

112
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,845
There's money for someone in that girl.
You see if she don't have quite a run.

113
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,853
Perhaps I could become
a sympathizer after all.

114
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,411
Will you come and see me?

115
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:18,250
- Where do you live?
- I know where Miss Chancellor lives.

116
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm acquainted with your family,
of course, Miss Chancellor.

117
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:25,477
I believe your father knew my father,
Abraham Greenstreet, the abolitionist.

118
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,199
I want to thank you.

119
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,461
Mr. Ransom.

120
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,322
I was certain you would come.
I felt it all day. Something told me.

121
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,558
Mother said I'd better come right on.

122
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,896
Your mother saw
that I meant what I said.

123
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,905
I was shaken from head to foot.

124
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,913
What power. What power, Miss Tarrant.

125
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,558
It's a regular dreamlike place.

126
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:16,552
I want to know you.

127
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,944
I felt that as soon as
I heard you speak last night.

128
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,277
There's so much I want to ask you.

129
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,832
I can't say much except
when father has worked on me...

130
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,482
- I don't care anything about your father.
- He's wonderfully magnetic.

131
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:32,675
It isn't your father, it isn't your mother.
It's only you, just as you are.

132
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,492
Will you be my friend?

133
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,958
My friend of friends?

134
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,608
Forever and ever?

135
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:47,966
My carriage was ordered for three
and it still hasn't appeared.

136
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,148
You have a visitor.

137
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,971
Miss Verena Tarrant,
my sister, Mrs. Luna.

138
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,525
Why, you're on the stage.
What do you do?

139
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,418
Are you an actress? Do you sing?

140
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,451
I can never carry a tune.

141
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:08,096
- Verena has a divine gift.
- Oh.

142
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,357
Olive, we have another visitor.

143
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,616
Our interesting cousin
whom you so providentially discovered.

144
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,009
We'll meet again soon.
Very, very soon.

145
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,122
This is only the beginning.

146
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,803
Why, Miss Chancellor. Good afternoon.

147
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:35,222
I'm so glad my carriage is late
or you would've missed seeing me.

148
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:39,259
Oh, Mrs. Luna,
I would've been disconsolate.

149
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:43,290
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going back to New York today.

150
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:45,216
Mama! I wanna go!

151
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,615
Newton, you know Mama will be back
an hour from now.

152
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:50,943
- I wanna go! I wanna go! I wanna go!
- Mama has to go, Newton dearest.

153
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,929
No!

154
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,230
Miss Tarrant won't be surprised
if I recognize her,

155
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,929
if I take the liberty to speak to her?

156
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:03,066
- Many gentlemen speak to me.
- We'll see each other again tomorrow.

157
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:06,965
Miss Tarrant,
I know what your ideas are.

158
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,420
You expressed them last night
in such beautiful language,

159
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,844
I am duly ashamed of being a man.

160
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:18,173
But must you go the moment I appear?
Do you flee before the individual male?

161
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:20,278
I like the individual well enough.

162
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,162
Won't you sit down again?

163
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:27,092
I'm certain Miss Chancellor'd
be extremely sorry to part with you.

164
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:30,165
You'll just catch the Charles Street car.

165
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,881
I would like to interpret for you
the position of women in history.

166
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,285
Now...

167
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,413
Well, what do you say to Helen of Troy?

168
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:43,892
The fearful carnage she excited...
all without the benefit of the vote.

169
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,645
Excuse me.

170
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:56,533
- He's a joker.
- He's an enemy.

171
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:01,785
An enemy of our movement and our sex.
You must fear him.

172
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,250
Do you?

173
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:06,933
I fear his ideas.

174
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:15,251
Tomorrow, we'll be alone,
and we'll talk and talk.

175
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,544
Just you and I.

176
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,111
All of Olive's friends are like that.

177
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,649
What an extraordinary young woman,
Olive. Is she your latest discovery?

178
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:33,495
Your veil is not put on straight, Adeline.

179
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,536
Goodbye, Mr. Ransom.

180
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,061
I hope you have a safe journey
back to New York.

181
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,557
Well, I thank you very much for...

182
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:49,238
Come away with me
and I'll explain her as we go.

183
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,520
I must get away from here.

184
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,685
We'll meet often.

185
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,929
I've made up my mind:
A winter in New York.

186
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,063
Look here, Mrs. Luna,
if your sister was not going to like me,

187
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,922
then why in the world
did she write to me?

188
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,323
Because she thought I'd like you.

189
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,953
"Then when a little more
I raised my brow,

190
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:40,776
"I spied the master of the sapient throng,
seated amid the philosophic train.

191

"Him all admire,
all pay him reverence due.

192

"There Socrates and Plato
both I mark'd,

193

who sets the world at chance,

and Empedocles,

196
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:05,486
"Orpheus I mark'd, and Linus,
Tully, and moral Seneca.

197

200
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,732
"Entsagen sollst du, sollst entsagen. "

201
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,001
- What's it mean?
- Thou shalt give up.

202
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,719
Entsagen sollst du.

203
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:59,143
It means to renounce everything...

204
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,627
yourself, your life.

205
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,837
Are you ready for it?

206
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,119
"I feel I am something of
a novice upon this platform.

"One of a race whose inheritance
has been outrage and wrong.

208

"Most of my life had been spent
in battling those wrongs.

209
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:23,107
"But I did not feel as keenly as others

210
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,632
that I had these rights
in common with other women. "

211
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:30,789
Ladies, no movement please.

to Harvard College with our brothers. '

'That is not possible. '

217
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,947

221
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:23,197
What if I were to ask you to give up
your parents, everything...

222
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,018
Oh, how can I ask you? I must give up.

223
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,004
Perhaps you like me too much.

224
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,173
Of course I like you too much.

225
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,276
When I like, I like too much.

226
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:42,654
? When I was a child

227
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:46,268
? And you were a child

228

? In our kingdom by the sea

Right here.

237

Ten cents, please, sir.

238
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:51,095
Would you ask Mr. Richard
if I might settle with him tomorrow?

239
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,856
Thank you.

240
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,989
"Cannot resist the vulgar temptation

Free.

"From manner, we pass naturally

Let me go! Ow!

256
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:56,111
Stop it! Let go!

257
00:20:56,217 --> 00:21:00,210
Stop it! Stop it right now!
Get that awful brute off my Newton!

258
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:02,384
- Take your hands off him this instant!
- Stop it!

259
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:04,310
Don't you be calling my son no names.

260
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:08,597
- It was your little shrimp that started it.
- Are you gonna do it again?!

261
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:17,295
Newton, never start a fight
you can't finish.

262
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,221
Oh...

263
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,578
Let Mother see.

264
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,746
Oh, poor Newton.

265
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:29,774
He needs a father's guidance
to help him stand up for himself.

266
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,859
What do you hear from Boston,
from your sister?

267
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,037
Can you imagine?

268
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:44,523
She's brought that red-headed hoyden
into her house to live.

269
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,181
She's educating her.

270
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,896
Do you mean that rather striking
young lady whom I met in Boston?

271
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,551
Newton, you're too heavy
for Mama. Get down.

272
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:54,765
No, I don't want to...

273
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:57,323
Dori, would you come and get him,
please, and give him a bath?

274
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,151
- No.
- Go on, Newton.

275
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,139
No!

276
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:05,615
Yes, I remember your
being struck by Verena.

277
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,612
Verena? Is that her name?

278
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:12,529
If you ask me, I think she cares
as much for the rights of women

279
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:14,960
as she does for the Panama Canal.

280
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,651
The only right of a woman she wants

281
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:19,568
is to be able to climb up on something
where men can look at her.

282
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,087
But mark my words: One of these days,

283
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:25,008
she'll give her the greatest cut
Olive's ever had in her life.

284
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:27,244
Oh? What will she do to your sister?

285
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:31,055
She'll run away with a lion tamer.
She'll marry a circus man.

286
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:33,640
Unless of course you want to marry her.

287
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:36,200
You seem so interested in her.

288
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,329
Well...

289
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:43,050
I thank you for an excellent dinner.

290
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:46,447
You are not to belong to any Verena.
You are to belong to me.

291
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:55,208
The mind rules the body
with a scepter of reason.

292
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:04,358
Can you feel my hand draw out
the rays of affirmation?

293
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,103
Have you got that, Mr. Pardon?

294
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:13,799
Shut your eyes. Repeat after me.

295
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,868
I am the child of reason, and as such,

296
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:19,972
pure, perfect and without flaw.

297
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:24,993
I am the child of reason, and as such,

298
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:28,843
pure, perfect and without flaw.

299
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,585
Now, rest your mind from the thought.

300
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,553
Eyes shut. Shut, shut.

301
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:40,106
Now, draw back to the thought.

302
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:45,669
I am a child of reason, and as such,

303
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,599
pure, perfect and without flaw.

304
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:52,456
That is all for today.

305
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:56,383
This healing must not strain,
but descend gently.

306
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,311
I am the child of reason.

307
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:05,727
I want you to think of green fields.

308
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,345
Nothing but green fields this week.

309
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,760
Our next session will be on Thursday.

310
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:20,253
Remember to keep her knees warm,
we don't want fluid on her joints...

311
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,637
We're very grateful to you, Dr. Tarrant.
She's felt a beautiful benefit.

312
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,361
Have you got that, Mr. Pardon?

313
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:29,470
Thank you, Doctor.

314
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,395
It's time for Miss Verena to press
forward. I want to see her in a front seat.

315
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:45,282
What do you have in mind?

316
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:47,553
Her name on the biggest posters,

317
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,239
her portrait in the windows
of all the shops.

318
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:54,170
I'll tell you straight: I want to see her
in the music hall, at 50 cents a ticket.

319
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:56,863
We shall have to talk
with Miss Chancellor.

320
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,371
If Miss Chancellor hangs back,

321
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:01,731
I'm prepared to take hold myself.
Do you understand me?

322
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:14,745
The American public want to hear
Miss Verena, and they shall hear her.

323
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,738
Good day, sir.

324
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,016
I don't know what everyone's waiting for.

325
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:27,227
I don't suppose they're waiting
till she's 50 years old.

326
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,640
There are enough old ones in the field.
I've known a lot of celebrated ladies,

327
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:34,266
and had the honor of
condensing them into shorthand,

328
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,955
and some of them
were quite voluminous.

329
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:38,716
But I can tell you this:

330
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,239
There's never been
a more attractive female speaker

331
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:42,872
before the American public.

332
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:44,439
They try to, but does it mean
going to lectures?

333
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,847
- And getting up at 9:00.
- Oh, heaven forbid.

334
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,768
Pleasure to see you in our home,
Miss Chancellor.

335
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:56,345
It quite raises my appetite
for social intercourse.

336
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:59,743
Verena seems to be having
such a time with those gentlemen.

337
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,654
I have the most terrible prejudices.
I'm full of wrong ideas.

338
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:08,534
It's a privilege to hear you talking.
It's what I call real conversation.

339
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:11,159
First I catch one thing, then another.

340
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:14,132
Seems as if I couldn't take it all in.

341
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,380
Miss Verena has charm. And there's
a great demand for that nowadays

342
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,696
in connection with the new ideas.

343
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:23,795
There are just so many
who've fallen dead for want of it.

344
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:26,269
But Miss Verena ought to
walk right up to the top.

345
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:30,326
The truth is,
she needs to shed her father.

346
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:34,454
She don't want him pawing around her
that way on the platform.

347
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:36,629
It don't add to the attraction one bit.

348
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,838
Now, I'll put it to you, Miss Chancellor:

349
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,842
We could run her together.

350
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:46,164
Might I tempt you, madam?
The apple fritters are very fine.

351
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:49,781
If you sat down and listened for
five minutes, you would be convinced.

352
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:51,410
Do offer them over here, Father.

353
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:54,133
You know how students from
Harvard College are always starving.

354
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:55,347
Yes, for truth and knowledge,

355
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:58,200
- and, of course, principally beauty.
- They certainly teach you to talk.

356
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:00,339
We don't wanna talk at all.
We wanna listen.

357
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:02,646
You should listen to Olive Chancellor.

358
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:05,496
She knows much more than I do
and she has wonderful ideas.

359
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,765
- Go and talk to her.
- But we wanna hear you.

360
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,426
- You must speak.
- I can't.

361
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,904
I can't do anything
with a small audience.

362
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:13,619
- Gracie here's a host in himself.
- I wish we brought our friends.

363
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:15,793
Everyone in the university
wants to hear you.

364
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:17,391
We are sunk in ignorance
and prejudice.

365
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:20,247
I didn't realize you were
Harvard University.

366
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:24,435
Mr. Burrage is from New York.
He's very fashionable.

367
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:27,154
He goes out a great deal in Boston.

368
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:30,868
I've no doubt you know
some of the places.

369
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:33,237
His family's very rich.

370
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,150
Well, he knows plenty of that sort.

371
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:37,873
But he didn't know anyone like us,

372
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:40,790
so we told Mr. Gracie,
of course, bring him.

373
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:43,822
I speak seriously.
I don't want to make money out of it.

374
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:48,236
- What do you want to make?
- I want to make history.

375
00:27:48,342 --> 00:27:52,466
I wanna help the ladies... in general.

376
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:56,363
And Miss Verena in particular.

377
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,776
They're asking me to speak.
What do you say?

378
00:28:01,877 --> 00:28:03,568
I know you like me to speak.

379
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:06,669
Yes, at the right time
and the right place.

380
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:08,715
Now is your chance
with Harvard College.

381
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,017
These gentlemen will carry the news.
Make them gasp.

382
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:15,499
- Would you like me to start her up?
- I'll do it alone, if you prefer.

383
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:19,052
This might be a good chance
to try without father.

384
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,617
What do you want me to do?

385
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,829
Oh, come on,
give us the whole program.

386
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:27,023
I want you to address audiences
that are worth addressing.

387
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:30,255
Not to exhibit yourself to individuals.

388
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,744
I want you to touch the heart of nations.

389
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:37,739
Do as you like, my dear. I must leave.

390
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,904
- I can see you don't want it.
- Come with me.

391
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:52,776
- You're angry. What have I done?
- I'm not angry. I'm anxious and afraid.

392
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:56,176
Verena, those young men don't care
for you. They don't care for us.

393
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,306
All they want is to make us give up
everything we think is sacred.

394
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:03,631
No, they don't want that, Olive.
They don't ask as much as that.

395
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:06,827
Then go in and speak for them
and sing for them and dance for them.

396
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:09,416
Olive, you're cruel.

397
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,643
Yes, perhaps I am,
but promise me one thing,

398
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:17,256
and I'll be oh, so tender.

399
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,301
Oh, my poor darling's cold.

400
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:25,446
I'm selfish and dreadful, I know it, but...

401
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,589
But promise me that...

402
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:32,330
Verena, you'll catch
your death of cold out there.

403
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:45,287
Promise me not to marry.

404
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:06,155
Leave us alone, entirely alone for a year,
and I'll write you another.

405
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:11,012
The great thing is to help her to develop.

406
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:16,292
That's all we ask of you:
Just let her act out her own nature.

407
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:19,940
Don't shut down the cover,
Miss Chancellor. Just let her overflow.

408
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:17,598
Miss Birdseye?

409
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:21,214
Miss Birdseye. Good morning, ma'am,
you don't remember me,

410
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:24,066
but I attended an evening
at your house last year...

411
00:31:24,164 --> 00:31:27,198
at which a young lady gave a wonderful
speech. I came with Miss Chancellor.

412
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,689
I remember you now,
and Olive bringing you.

413
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:31,203
But you live in New York.

414
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,529
- Have you come to stay in Boston now?
- I'm here on business for a day or two.

415
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:37,759
May I escort you a little ways?

416
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:39,998
A gentleman from the south
is not required to escort

417
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,466
an old Bostonian around her own city.

418
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:46,785
Well, only in chivalry, Miss Birdseye.
Old southern chivalry.

419
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:50,495
They didn't show me so much of that
when I was down there in the old days.

420
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:52,699
They were always round after me.

421
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:55,486
Why was that? On account
of your work for the Negroes?

422
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:57,887
Yes, I carried them the Bible.

423
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:13,306
A Woman of the 19th Century.

424
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,238
Verena Tarrant spoke on that subject
at the last convention.

425
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,335
Does she speak often?

426
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,033
She raises her voice a good deal

427
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:26,518
in places around,
like Framingham and Billerica.

428
00:32:26,623 --> 00:32:31,130
It's as if she were gathering strength
just to break over Boston like a wave.

429
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:36,411
What a great pity she isn't
speaking somewhere tonight.

430
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,550
Tomorrow I have to return to New York.

431
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:43,640
Today she's visiting with her mother
in Cambridge. Olive mentioned that.

432
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:47,226
Where in Cambridge
does her family live?

433
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,911
Oh, it's in one of those little streets

434
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:52,566
that doesn't seem to
have much of a name.

435
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:55,575
Well, it must be called something.

436
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:59,735
Is it a street, a square, a place?

437
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:03,033
Yes, that's it. A place, yes.

438
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:05,339
- Monadnoc.
- Monadnoc.

439
00:33:05,436 --> 00:33:07,891
- Monadnoc Place.
- I see.

440
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,328
But ain't you going to
see your cousin, too?

441
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,599
Miss Birdseye,
I wonder if you'd be so kind

442
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:19,481
as not to mention our meeting
to my cousin.

443
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,172
You want me to conceal that...

444
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:25,104
I don't want you to conceal anything.
I simply wish you'd let it pass,

445
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,479
not mention it.

446
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:30,578
I never did anything of that kind.

447
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:42,455
Won't Verena tell her?

448
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,066
She tells her most everything.
Their union is so close.

449
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:48,438
She won't want her to be wounded.

450
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:52,311
Well, you are considerate.
It's a pity you can't sympathize.

451
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,547
Perhaps Miss Tarrant
will bring me around.

452
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:57,518
You have before you a possible convert.

453
00:33:57,624 --> 00:34:01,421
In that case, I won't say a word
to Olive about our meeting.

454
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,275
Hi.

455
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:16,148
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

456
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,579
- Miss Birdseye, I hope to see you again.
- I'm always about the streets of Boston.

457
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:29,133
219 West Newton Street.
Good day, ma'am.

458
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,325
I've decided to show you
Harvard College

459
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:09,004
because it seems to me that I ought to
do something for you in return.

460
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:12,552
In return for your kind visit.

461
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:17,513
- And the weather is so splendid.
- What an ideal guide.

462
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:40,997
Do you still make speeches?

463
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:44,748
Olive's told me about you. That you're
a great enemy to our movement.

464
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:48,262
If you regard me as an enemy,
it was very kind of you to receive me.

465
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,090
A great many gentlemen call.

466
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,125
Everyone's so interested.
In our work, I mean.

467
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:00,301
You know, this is where
I ought to have been.

468
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:02,765
I should have liked to study here.

469
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:06,789
Can't expect me to speak with
much admiration of an institution

470
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:09,478
in which the doors are closed to our sex.

471
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:12,395
Do you advocate a system
of education in common?

472
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:16,583
I advocate equal rights,
equal opportunities, equal privileges.

473
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:18,855
- So does Miss Chancellor.
- Oh.

474
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:20,995
I thought what she wanted
was a different inequality,

475
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,653
simply to turn out the men altogether.

476
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:45,605
Now mind, if you don't like
what's in here, it isn't my fault.

477
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,462
Why, is anything against Mississippi?

478
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:49,765
It's in honor of our young men
who fought in the war.

479
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:54,819
- Oh, it says they're brave, I suppose.
- Yes. It says so in Latin.

480
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:57,792
Well, so they were.

481
00:36:57,897 --> 00:37:00,002
I ought to know that.

482
00:37:00,105 --> 00:37:02,014
I had to fight.

483
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:35,928
I wish you could've seen us in June.

484
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,128
We just quivered, Mr. Ransom.

485
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:42,592
It was our convention.

486
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:46,037
There were delegates
from every state and every city.

487
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:50,780
Olive had six wonderful women
staying in the house, two in a room.

488
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,716
In the evenings, we sat
in the open windows and we talked.

489
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,839
And we talked.

490
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:04,084
We ate quantities of ice cream.

491
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,895
Well, now, Miss Tarrant,
I am forced to the painful conclusion

492
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,405
that you're simply ruined.

493
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,641
- Ruined?
- Yes.

494
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,557
Ruined yourself.

495
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,943
Aren't you going to see Olive at all?

496
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,133
She's different now.

497
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:31,096
- She's much happier.
- Why? Because of you?

498
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:33,236
She'll know you've been here.

499
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:37,653
- Not unless you tell her.
- I tell her everything.

500
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,426
I do.

501
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,284
If I don't tell Olive,
then you must leave me here.

502
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,201
And there mustn't be anything more.

503
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:52,981
There must not, Mr. Ransom, really.

504
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:56,499
Why, what are you afraid
there might be?

505
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:02,576
Miss Birdseye's hoping it will be.
She's hoping you'll convert me.

506
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:07,188
Just think how effective, out of darkest
Mississippi, I could blaze forth.

507
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,176
First-class proselyte.

508
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,208
Mr. Ransom,
do you know what strikes me?

509
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:15,761
The interest you take in me
isn't a bit controversial.

510
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:17,490
It's just personal.

511
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,487
Are you going to tell Miss Chancellor?

512
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:31,894
Come hither! Come here!

513
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:35,603
- Over here! Over here!
- Good afternoon, madam.

514
00:40:54,677 --> 00:40:56,564
Ahh.

515
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:15,022
My son's letters are full of nothing
but you and Miss Tarrant.

516
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:19,759
And she is everything he says.
It's charming.

517
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:23,536
- What was it?
- "Lied ohne Worte" by Mendelssohn.

518
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:27,497
- What does it mean?
- Song without words.

519
00:41:28,562 --> 00:41:30,537
She's growing from strength to strength.

520
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:33,609
Her dedication is unshakable.

521
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,146
It would be a privilege
for me to introduce her

522
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,283
to sympathetic circles in New York.

523
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,907
I hope you'll let me.
It would make me happy.

524
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:53,002
And it would
make my son very happy.

525
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:32,197
She is an original, no doubt.

526
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,236
I can see your attraction for her,
with your collector's taste.

527
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:37,861
Oh, Mother, it's a very different affair
from my collect...

528
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:41,314
- Mrs. Burrage.
- Oh, yes, Mr., um...

529
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,038
- Tom Gracie.
- Yes, Mr. Gracie. How are you?

530
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,212
- Very well, ma'am.
- Are you off to supper?

531
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:50,658
To a tutorial, I'm afraid.
How is the delightful Miss Tarrant?

532
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:53,414
Delightful. As always.

533
00:42:53,516 --> 00:42:57,160
Bundle up, Mr. Gracie, it's chilly out.

534
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:59,747
Enjoy the rest of your visit, ma'am.

535
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,772
- Bye.
- Good night.

536
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,362
- Good night.
- Good night.

537
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:14,792
You've been so strange all day,
and yesterday.

538
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,599
Ever since you came back
from visiting your mother.

539
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:22,182
Your thoughts have been away from me.

540
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:24,898
You know, Olive...

541
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:31,709
I sometimes wonder, if it weren't for you,
if I should feel it so very much.

542
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,975
About not having a vote.

543
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,592
Women being exploited.

544
00:43:43,015 --> 00:43:46,179
I feel it all the time.

545
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:49,344
Night and day, I feel it here...

546
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:51,748
as one feels a stain upon one's honor.

547
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,373
I know how it is for you,

548
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:56,031
how exposed to men you are.

549
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,714
Many would gladly stop your mouth
by kissing you.

550
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:07,329
Olive, you know what
you asked me once to promise you?

551
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:11,357
I will promise now.
I'll take any vow you want.

552
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:23,961
I hope with all my heart you never marry,
but not because you promise me.

553
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,937
I would rather trust you without.

554
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:29,978
You'll often be asked to marry.

555
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,733
I never will.

556
00:44:33,763 --> 00:44:38,433
Don't promise. But don't fail me.

557
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:46,337
"The editor regrets... "

558
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,922
Respectfully yours, too, sir.

559
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:43,641
Thank you, Mary.

560
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:50,971
Perhaps, Miss Chancellor's idea
for Verena's future

561
00:45:51,068 --> 00:45:56,054
may not coincide with yours... or mine.

562
00:45:58,012 --> 00:46:00,084
Do you mind?

563
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:04,116
I know it's not what you're entitled to
expect. The daughter of a faith healer.

564
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:09,041
Oh, I like the girl, Henry.
Quite apart from my liking for you.

565
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:14,166
Well, you haven't met the parents.

566
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:17,233
It doesn't in the least matter.

567
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:20,338
A girl like Verena
makes her own standards.

568
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,184
Dear, how lovely you look.

569
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:34,321
Good to see you.

570
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,115
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

571
00:46:36,217 --> 00:46:38,705
- Madam.
- Good evening.

572
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:43,151
Oh, my dear.

573
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,166
Are you a member?
I didn't know you'd joined.

574
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:58,351
I haven't.
Nothing would induce me.

575
00:46:58,455 --> 00:47:00,179
Please come and hear
Professor Gougenheim.

576
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,581
I'll invite you.
He's going to talk about the Talmud.

577
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,533
This woman tonight,
isn't she from Boston?

578
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,794
You must be pretty desperate when you've
got to go to Boston for your entertainment.

579
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:11,277
Why, Miss Chancellor, how very nice
to see you again. May I join you?

580
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:22,638
It's very amusing.

581
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:25,741
We don't have anything
so brilliant in Mississippi.

582
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,586
And how wonderful
to see you and Miss Tarrant,

583
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:31,245
the heroines, on an occasion like this.

584
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:34,064
Do I look like the heroine
of an occasion?

585
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:36,553
Well, now you would
if you didn't hide yourself away.

586
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:38,798
Are you not going into the other room?

587
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,755
I'm going when I'm asked.
When I'm invited.

588
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,372
So, are you going to stir up
the fashionable world?

589
00:47:47,475 --> 00:47:52,209
We carry our work where it is needed.
We have learned to stifle our distaste.

590
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:54,925
You will understand
when you listen to Miss Tarrant.

591
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:58,856
- Hm. Miss Tarrant.
- Why, what do you know about her?

592
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,613
Don't you remember my hearing her
speak that night at Miss Birdseye's?

593
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:03,372
That was the only time.

594
00:48:03,474 --> 00:48:05,808
No, I met her again the next day
at your house.

595
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,432
Mr. Belmont, you really should
be going in.

596
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:10,188
- We're just about to start.
- Thank you.

597
00:48:11,377 --> 00:48:14,311
Excuse me, Miss Chancellor, but if
you'll do me the favor to take my arm,

598
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,199
I'll find you a good seat
in the other room.

599
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:19,151
I recommend you find
a seat without delay.

600
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,215
If you've never heard Miss Tarrant, you'll
have one of the greatest pleasures of your life.

601
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,360
Mr. Ransom only comes
to ventilate his prejudices.

602
00:48:24,464 --> 00:48:26,852
Oh, don't be so rough on me.

603
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:38,062
The last person I expected to see
at the Wednesday Club.

604
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,231
You never told me
you knew Mrs. Burrage.

605
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,756
Well, I don't. I never even heard
of her till she asked me.

606
00:48:42,862 --> 00:48:45,196
Then why in the world did she ask you?

607
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:47,563
I suppose your sister
had her card sent to me.

608
00:48:47,662 --> 00:48:50,117
- Let me find you a place inside...
- My sister, my grandmother.

609
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:52,228
I know how Olive loves you.

610
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:59,078
The chairs are all filled up,
but we could hear from the doorway.

611
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:01,123
We won't be disturbed here.

612
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,498
I don't intend to lose
any of the sport in there, you know.

613
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:06,597
Oh, you won't find much sport
at the Wednesday Club.

614
00:49:09,452 --> 00:49:12,801
Isn't it more fun, just the two of us,
tęte-ŕ-tęte?

615
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,544
It is the greatest pleasure
and privilege for me

616
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:26,596
to welcome Miss Verena Tarrant
on her first appearance in New York.

617
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,852
Some have called her a great
prophetess, some a poetess,

618
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:32,481
some a seer.

619
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:37,343
But I will confine myself to introducing
her to you only as a young woman

620
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:41,192
with an extraordinary awareness
of the great question

621
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,585
pertaining to the equality of women.

622
00:49:48,873 --> 00:49:52,037
There she goes. She's off.

623
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,356
You stand on historic ground.

624
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,323
100 years ago, on this ground,

625
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:08,515
our forefathers poured out their blood
in the name of freedom.

626
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:12,990
In the name of freedom,
I ask you one simple question:

627
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:15,968
Do you think any good
can come to a society

628
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,980
where women are treated as slaves?

629
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:21,218
The public life of the world
will continue in the same...

630
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,962
It was her son's idea, of course.
Just between you and me,

631
00:50:25,062 --> 00:50:29,055
young Mr. Burrage
is in very thick with Verena.

632
00:50:29,157 --> 00:50:32,867
Verena goes around lecturing
how no one should ever get married.

633
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:37,341
But I think, in this case,
she's beginning to change her mind.

634
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:40,059
But first they'll have to deal with Olive,

635
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:42,881
because she has not
changed her mind about marriage.

636
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:45,534
And if you ask me
what offices we may fill,

637
00:50:45,636 --> 00:50:48,985
I should reply, "Any. "

638
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,457
Let us be sea captains
and see how we prove ourselves.

639
00:50:56,323 --> 00:51:00,185
The especial genius of women,
I believe to be intuitive in function,

640
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:04,349
spiritual in tendency,
electrical in movement.

641
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,291
Try us and you'll see.

642
00:51:07,394 --> 00:51:10,111
I am not here to recriminate,

643
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,309
nor to deepen the gulf
that already yawns between the sexes...

644
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:17,752
You know, I've never understood how
Olive can bear Verena's really low style.

645
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:20,824
I'm surprised at young Mr. Burrage.
After all, he is a gentleman.

646
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:23,798
Certainly he can see
that she is not his type of person.

647
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:26,872
Let me find you a place inside. You can
stand on a chair, you can lean on me...

648
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:29,824
Sit down, Mr. Ransom.
Surely you wouldn't be so ungallant

649
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,789
as to leave a lady
absolutely alone in a public place.

650
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:36,922
That is what I should like to
press home to each of you individually.

651
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:38,431
Personally.

652
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:43,284
To give him the vision of the world
as it hangs perpetually before me.

653
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:48,726
Redeemed.
Transfigured by a new moral tone.

654
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:54,963
There would be tenderness,
sympathy, generosity,

655
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,900
where now there is only brute force
and sordid rivalry...

656
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:03,222
- How silly she sounds.
- You can't even hear what she's saying.

657
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:08,278
Mr. Ransom, my sister never sent you
an invitation to this place.

658
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:10,072
Didn't it come from Verena Tarrant?

659
00:52:10,173 --> 00:52:11,548
If Miss Tarrant sent me an invitation,

660
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:13,882
I ought to at least return
the courtesy by listening to her.

661
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,810
If you rise from that seat,
I will tell Olive what I suspect.

662
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:20,818
Oh, what do you suspect?

663
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:24,088
That the two of you have
been in correspondence.

664
00:52:24,956 --> 00:52:26,549
Have you been seeing Miss Tarrant?

665
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:28,954
Have you been going
to Boston on secret visits?

666
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:30,993
You've lost your head.

667
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,409
Who shall judge what we require
if not we ourselves?

668
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:39,573
We require simply freedom.
We require the lid

669
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:43,122
to be taken off the box in which
we have been kept for centuries.

670
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,605
You say it is a very nice,
comfortable, cozy box...

671
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,902
with nice glass sides
so that we can see out.

672
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:54,995
And that all that is needed
is another quiet turn of the key.

673
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:59,282
That is very easily answered.

674
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:02,257
Good gentlemen...

675
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:08,945
you have never been in the box
and you do not know how it feels.

676
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:20,751
Do you know how you strike me?

677
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:24,467
You strike me as men
who are starving to death...

678
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:29,360
while at home they have a cupboard
full of bread and meat and wine.

679
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,515
Or as blind, demented beings

680
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:37,364
who let themselves be cast
into a debtor's prison,

681
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:41,007
while in their pockets they have
the keys of vaults and treasure chests

682
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,405
heaped up with gold and silver.

683
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:48,818
The meat and wine,

684
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:52,013
the gold and silver,

685
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:56,490
are simply the suppressed
and wasted force.

686
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,329
The genius, the intelligence,

687
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:04,363
the inspiration of women.

688
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:09,004
We are the heart of humanity.

689
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:11,496
Let us have the courage to insist upon it.

690
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:03,213
- Don't you think it's all true?
- No, I don't.

691
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:07,053
- But it doesn't matter what I think.
- Oh, well. If you're so indifferent...

692
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:09,517
It's not because I'm indifferent.

693
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:14,501
Mr. Ransom here is about
the hardest subject I've ever met.

694
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:16,394
He will stand out.

695
00:55:16,494 --> 00:55:19,243
- Don't mean to say you weren't moved.
- I didn't say that.

696
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:22,472
- What is it?
- Champagne.

697
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,776
Oh, I can't drink that.

698
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,010
- Is he a great follower?
- He's crazy about our movement.

699
00:55:31,116 --> 00:55:33,450
But if you still wanna
draw me back 5,000 years,

700
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:35,620
I hope you won't tell Miss Birdseye.

701
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:41,157
She's very romantic about us.
About our relations. Yours and mine.

702
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,681
She is sure that I'm going
to convert you,

703
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:45,697
and that you're going
to become a champion.

704
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:50,440
And that when you get to the top,
it will all have been because of me.

705
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:53,256
A sort of marriage
between the South and Boston.

706
00:55:53,354 --> 00:55:56,769
- A marriage of ideas.
- You don't want me to disillusion her.

707
00:55:58,506 --> 00:56:02,084
You mustn't... ever.

708
00:56:09,225 --> 00:56:11,232
Mrs. Burrage, I thank you so much.

709
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:14,784
I never saw an entertainment of any kind
which held me more completely by its charm.

710
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:18,271
I'm so glad you were able to come.
Wonderful creature, isn't she?

711
00:56:18,377 --> 00:56:19,522
Yes.

712
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:22,940
Miss Chancellor is Miss Tarrant's
great friend and colleague.

713
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,357
Let me introduce Mr., uh...

714
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:26,725
No, I have the honor to be
a sort of cousin of Miss Chancellor.

715
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:30,686
- That is, if she doesn't repudiate me.
- Oh.

716
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:33,409
Well, if you're Miss Chancellor's cousin,

717
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:36,129
take her in to have some supper
instead of going so soon.

718
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:39,973
I'm very much obliged.
I never take supper.

719
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:44,315
These occasions leave me exhausted.

720
00:56:45,766 --> 00:56:48,668
Oh, I can imagine that.

721
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,872
I'll leave you to be quiet
with your cousin.

722
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,843
You're in the best of hands, I'm sure.

723
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:05,438
I won't disturb you further
than to ask you a single question.

724
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,217
Where are you staying?
I want to come and see Miss Tarrant.

725
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:10,942
I don't say I want to come and see you

726
00:57:11,044 --> 00:57:13,465
because I have the idea
you would not welcome me.

727
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,343
Why do you ply to me?

728
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:19,647
Well, it seems to me more decent
to go straight to you

729
00:57:19,747 --> 00:57:22,529
for the information I intend to get.

730
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:29,211
If you won't tell me where you're staying,
perhaps you'll ask Miss Tarrant herself to do so.

731
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:31,681
Would she send me word on a card?

732
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:43,358
Number 11, West 10th Street.

733
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:46,141
You're free to come.

734
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:50,398
Of course I am. Why shouldn't I be?

735
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,494
Steady.

736
00:58:56,347 --> 00:58:58,681
It was you who took him up
in the first place.

737
00:58:58,779 --> 00:59:00,786
I thought you would have
married him by now.

738
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:04,403
Marry him yourself. What ever
put such an idea into your head?

739
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,638
Do you think I can marry every man
that follows me about?

740
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:09,495
It must have been you
who encouraged Verena

741
00:59:09,594 --> 00:59:11,536
to send him an invitation
to Mrs. Burrage's.

742
00:59:11,642 --> 00:59:14,162
Verena, to him?
Why in the world should she?

743
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:17,201
Why in the world wouldn't she,
since they're so very close.

744
00:59:17,305 --> 00:59:20,240
She had seen him twice in her life
before last night.

745
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:22,931
- Is that what she told you?
- She tells me everything.

746
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:26,710
Are you sure? Are you sure
that last night was only the third time?

747
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:29,549
Adeline Luna, what are you insinuating?

748
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:32,078
I'm just warning you, that's all.

749
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,972
Mr. Burrage explains everything
so beautifully.

750
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:01,360
Did he try to make love to you?

751
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:04,429
I suppose it was meant for love.
He says he likes me

752
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,698
for the same reason he likes
old enamels and old altar cloths.

753
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:08,725
Ha.

754
01:00:11,957 --> 01:00:17,674
Well, you know, Verena,
this isn't our real life.

755
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,090
- It isn't our work.
- No, it isn't. Certainly not.

756
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,592
How did you get his address?

757
01:00:29,524 --> 01:00:31,411
Mr. Ransom's?

758
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:34,737
To enable Mrs. Burrage to invite him.

759
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:38,668
It was in a letter I got from him.

760
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:42,770
I didn't know you correspond.

761
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:46,161
He wrote me once. I never told you.

762
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:52,871
Why didn't you tell me?

763
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:56,911
I knew you wouldn't like it
because you don't like him.

764
01:00:58,898 --> 01:01:02,574
I don't think of him. He's nothing to me.

765
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,556
- Now you suffer.
- Yes, you can make me suffer.

766
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,640
I never will.

767
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:24,220
I found this note when I came home.

768
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:29,824
He wants to see me.
He says he has so much to say to me.

769
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,190
Do you want to see him?

770
01:01:33,024 --> 01:01:35,391
Well, I must confess, I'm curious.

771
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:38,873
He's so awfully opposed.

772
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:41,785
I would like to meet him
and make him give in

773
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:45,336
at just two or three points
more than I'd like anything in the world.

774
01:01:46,112 --> 01:01:48,054
Needn't be afraid.

775
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:50,048
I'm strong enough.

776
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:05,211
Why do you make me say
such conceited things?

777
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:21,052
Look here, Olive Chancellor,
we can go home tomorrow if you want.

778
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,194
What do you want?

779
01:02:24,865 --> 01:02:27,232
To do whatever you think is best.

780
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,053
And if we do stay,

781
01:02:29,154 --> 01:02:32,056
will you be very much of the time
with Mr. Ransom?

782
01:02:35,266 --> 01:02:38,682
I thought you knew by now
that I'm serious.

783
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:40,674
That I've dedicated my life.

784
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:46,749
I don't know why
you don't seem able to trust me.

785
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:09,822
Olive, I'm starving.

786
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:11,811
Get dressed.

787
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:14,778
I presume you want to be
President of the United States.

788
01:03:14,883 --> 01:03:17,055
Ha. I certainly do.

789
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:23,004
However, since I shall no doubt
die poor and unheard of,

790
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:26,969
nobody'll ever know what visions
of greatness I stifled and buried.

791
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:30,304
You won't die unheard of.
When you start,

792
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:32,737
people had better look out,
with your will.

793
01:03:32,835 --> 01:03:36,697
- What do you know about my will?
- I know it's stronger than mine.

794
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:40,099
It made me come out with you
when I thought I'd much better not.

795
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,216
Well, then... it's settled.

796
01:03:49,316 --> 01:03:54,717
Miss Tarrant will come to us,
and will stay till she's tired of us.

797
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:00,068
Why do you want her
to visit you, Mrs. Burrage?

798
01:04:00,164 --> 01:04:03,098
You must know that
your son desires to marry her.

799
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,019
My son firmly believes
in your movement.

800
01:04:06,596 --> 01:04:08,963
And Miss Tarrant herself...

801
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:13,054
I expected success,
but I didn't expect what she...

802
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:16,026
What you gave us.

803
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:22,523
I know Henry will never again
care so much for any girl.

804
01:04:23,877 --> 01:04:27,586
Oh, my dear Miss Chancellor.

805
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:32,355
The poor boy
has put the affair in my hands.

806
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:34,874
And you see, I put it in yours.

807
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:39,487
I think you have never seen
Dr. Tarrant and his wife.

808
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,011
You mean, they're absolutely fearful?

809
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:46,305
Yes, Henry's told me
they're quite impossible.

810
01:04:46,405 --> 01:04:48,510
I'm prepared for that.

811
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:53,827
And we can,
we do offer certain advantages.

812
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:58,591
I need hardly say
that whatever means we have

813
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:00,832
are at the disposal of your movement.

814
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:06,524
You think I don't want everything
we poor women can get?

815
01:05:07,526 --> 01:05:12,741
And how can I be sure that afterwards

816
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:15,489
you would still care so much
about the question

817
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,307
that has all our thoughts,
hers and mine?

818
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:23,681
You think we're feigning interest
only to get hold of her.

819
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:27,939
Now, that's not very nice of you,
Miss Chancellor.

820
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,233
Of course you have to be
tremendously careful.

821
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:34,878
I dare say you don't like the idea
of her marrying at all.

822
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:40,198
It would break up a friendship
that has so much interest for you.

823
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:50,049
Then I'm to understand
as your final word

824
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:51,973
that you regard us as quite inferior?

825
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:55,716
Oh, for public uses, absolutely.
Perfectly weak and second-rate.

826
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:57,888
But privately, it's another matter.

827
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:01,471
My plan is to keep you at home
and have a good time with you there.

828
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:09,917
You seem to think that I control
Verena's actions and her desires,

829
01:06:10,023 --> 01:06:14,180
and that I'm jealous of any other
relations she may possibly form.

830
01:06:15,048 --> 01:06:19,870
I can only say your attitude illustrates
the way that relations between women

831
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:23,750
are still misunderstood
and misinterpreted.

832
01:06:23,848 --> 01:06:27,231
It is these attitudes we want to fight,

833
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:30,086
with all our strength and all our life,

834
01:06:30,183 --> 01:06:34,144
Miss Tarrant... Verena and I.

835
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,531
Well, Miss Chancellor,
you're quite a speaker yourself.

836
01:06:39,848 --> 01:06:42,695
No, I'm not. I'm awkward and dry.

837
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:47,332
It is she who is eloquent
and graceful and lovely.

838
01:06:48,744 --> 01:06:51,810
My son admires her as much as you do.

839
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:54,847
Of course,
he would never obtrude himself.

840
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:58,884
But suppose he withdraws.

841
01:06:58,984 --> 01:07:02,432
Do you think others would be
as reticent as he?

842
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:06,370
And would you feel yourself
as safe with these others?

843
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,775
What others do you mean?

844
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:19,328
Well, no one in particular.

845
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:22,568
But, for instance,
there is the young man

846
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:28,099
whom she asked me to send
an invitation to my party.

847
01:07:28,905 --> 01:07:30,531
I believe he said he was your cousin.

848
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:33,416
Now, he seemed to me
like a possible admirer.

849
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:39,977
I wonder if I might give you
a word of advice.

850
01:07:40,073 --> 01:07:44,132
My son is gentle, he's good-natured,

851
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,983
and he believes in your ideas.

852
01:07:47,466 --> 01:07:52,998
Miss Tarrant would be, from every point
of view, safer with him than with others.

853
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:55,880
Adventurers, exploiters.

854
01:07:55,978 --> 01:08:01,313
Or people who once they got hold
of her, would shut her up altogether.

855
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,650
Why don't you write out your ideas?

856
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:11,715
I have. Nobody wants to print them.

857
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:13,607
Editors are a mean, timid bunch,

858
01:08:13,707 --> 01:08:16,325
always saying
they want something original.

859
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:19,296
But they're deadly afraid of it
when it comes.

860
01:08:19,947 --> 01:08:23,624
So I get many letters.
They all start the same way.

861
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:25,959
"The editor regrets... "

862
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:29,223
Everyone regrets in New York.
That's all my clients ever do, too.

863
01:08:29,322 --> 01:08:31,744
There must be something
very wrong with me.

864
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:32,799
What do you think?

865
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:36,682
No, I think you'll do pretty well,
except for your opinions.

866
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:39,558
You'll pay for that.

867
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:43,179
One editor sent me back a manuscript,

868
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:47,017
said my ideas were
300 years out of date.

869
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:49,220
But, doubtless some magazine
of the 16th century

870
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,528
would've been happy to print them.

871
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,188
Oh, he's right.

872
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,844
On the rights of minorities,
I am 300 years out of date.

873
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:59,876
But you see, I haven't come too late.
I've come too soon.

874
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:06,049
I'm very sorry you can't get published.

875
01:09:08,108 --> 01:09:10,377
You must keep on.

876
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:11,850
And I hope you do succeed,

877
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:15,047
even though all you want
is to put us back.

878
01:09:15,148 --> 01:09:17,996
You may denounce me
by name if you like,

879
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:21,474
only don't say anything
about Olive Chancellor.

880
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,507
There you are again.

881
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:25,190
You women. You always think
it's something personal.

882
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:29,035
- You always think it means yourselves.
- Yes, that's what people say.

883
01:09:29,133 --> 01:09:33,606
Well, I don't want to talk about you.
My interest is in my own sex.

884
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:36,130
Yours evidently can look after itself.

885
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:40,898
Anyway, I'm tired of always hearing
about women and their freedom

886
01:09:41,005 --> 01:09:43,274
and their education, their liberty.

887
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:23,395
Woe to American women
when you get going.

888
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,886
I love American women.

889
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,056
Only certain examples of it I can't stand.

890
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:33,005
Ones that run around screaming,
"Down with men. "

891
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:37,063
"Down with the love
between women and men. "

892
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:40,109
Not you.

893
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:45,358
Shall I tell you?

894
01:10:48,398 --> 01:10:52,588
I don't believe you mean
what you preach. No, no.

895
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:55,369
It's just your sweet nature.

896
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:59,333
You always want to please someone.
Miss Chancellor, your parents.

897
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:04,871
Whoever else is dear to you.
But it's not really you.

898
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:09,643
You're meant for something different.

899
01:11:09,743 --> 01:11:11,848
You're meant for privacy.

900
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,272
You're meant for love.

901
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:18,185
For me.

902
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:53,352
You paid your visit to Mrs. Burrage.

903
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,833
- Yes, I went through that.
- And what did she say?

904
01:11:58,768 --> 01:12:00,491
She wants you to stay with her.

905
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:04,040
She says New York will be at your feet.

906
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:09,318
I won't stay.

907
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:12,144
I won't.

908
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,681
Olive Chancellor...

909
01:12:26,448 --> 01:12:28,553
take me away.

910
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,142
? For is it not the glorious fourth

911
01:13:24,242 --> 01:13:27,276
? We celebrate today

912
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:30,728
? This day gave freedom birth

913
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:34,282
? Its flame now fills the earth

914
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:37,998
? No storm from off our banner fled

915
01:13:38,098 --> 01:13:41,262
? What glorious light they shed?

916
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:53,802
Well, I guess I go back a long way.

917
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,650
Not all the way to '76, but near enough.

918
01:13:57,747 --> 01:14:01,064
I have seen changes,
I can tell you, glorious changes.

919
01:14:01,779 --> 01:14:03,602
Verena, come here.

920
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:05,936
Oh, there have been so many.

921
01:14:06,036 --> 01:14:11,306
Elizabeth Stanton, Susan B. Anthony,
Mrs. Lucretia Mott.

922
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:15,721
It's like we're one big army
just marching on.

923
01:14:17,811 --> 01:14:20,331
Isn't that lovely?

924
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:51,051
? Columbia's free men brave

925
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:54,419
? Rejoice to do a dare

926
01:14:54,516 --> 01:14:58,029
? This day the winds exalt to praise

927
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:00,499
? The stars and stripes in air?

928
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:03,215
Happy Birthday, Miss Birdseye.

929
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:37,077
Good afternoon.

930
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,131
Oh.

931
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:50,060
I guess it's time I should
take my remedy again.

932
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:53,045
You must tell me how much you take.

933
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:54,833
One spoonful or two?

934
01:15:54,934 --> 01:15:59,156
Well, I guess this time I'll take two.

935
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:03,028
- It's homeopathic.
- I know you wouldn't take anything else.

936
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:07,185
Well, it's generally admitted now
to be the true system.

937
01:16:07,286 --> 01:16:11,345
- One.
- I thought you were Verena.

938
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,326
Two.

939
01:16:18,263 --> 01:16:20,150
Miss Birdseye...

940
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:23,185
you remember the last time we met?

941
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:26,254
You very kindly gave me
Verena's address in Cambridge.

942
01:16:26,358 --> 01:16:30,734
Well, here you are again.
So it seems she has shaken you.

943
01:16:30,839 --> 01:16:32,148
Yes, ma'am.

944
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:34,451
She has shaken me tremendously.

945
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:38,061
We have seven letters
for you, Miss Birdseye.

946
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,578
Why, Mr. Ransom.

947
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:44,566
Where in the world
were you washed ashore?

948
01:16:44,663 --> 01:16:46,452
Well, I walked up, I found the door open,

949
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:48,461
Miss Birdseye seemed to think
I might stay.

950
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:52,364
Miss Birdseye, I appeal to you now,
I put myself under your protection.

951
01:16:52,472 --> 01:16:54,414
Don't we have room for all?

952
01:16:54,519 --> 01:16:58,164
Well, it was by my letter
that you knew we were here.

953
01:16:58,264 --> 01:17:00,631
The one I wrote
just before we came, Olive.

954
01:17:00,727 --> 01:17:03,248
Don't you remember, I showed it to you?

955
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:12,118
This is a charming place.

956
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:15,697
Only for you it has one defect.

957
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,648
Three-quarters
of the summer residents are women.

958
01:17:18,744 --> 01:17:20,654
Miss Tarrant said in her note,

959
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,022
this is a place you can wear
your old clothes and lie on the ground.

960
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,764
Well, I delight to lie on the ground.
All my clothes are old.

961
01:17:27,864 --> 01:17:30,832
I hope to be able to stay
three or four weeks.

962
01:17:51,544 --> 01:17:55,374
- They've accepted one of my articles.
- They have? When does it appear?

963
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:57,848
I got a letter from the editor
of the Rational Review,

964
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:59,669
telling me he should be
very happy to print it,

965
01:17:59,769 --> 01:18:01,777
and he should be very happy
to hear from me again.

966
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:04,402
Never fear, he shall
hear from me again. Oh, this...

967
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:08,215
This will seem pitiful to you,
but you see, for me,

968
01:18:08,314 --> 01:18:10,518
this changes the whole way
I look at my future.

969
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:13,913
Why? Didn't you feel happy
about your future before?

970
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,530
No, I felt very blue.

971
01:18:16,634 --> 01:18:20,725
But now...
now I'm building castles in the air,

972
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,826
and I'm putting you in the biggest
and the fairest of them.

973
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:35,896
Where's Mr. Ransom? I hope you
haven't pushed him overboard.

974
01:18:36,954 --> 01:18:41,591
- He's gone off round the other way.
- I hope he's going to speak for us soon.

975
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,625
He's written a very fine article
for the Rational Review.

976
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:49,619
Well, it's delightful to see
the way it goes on, isn't it?

977
01:18:52,634 --> 01:18:56,911
Oh. Verena Tarrant,
how cold your lips are.

978
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,578
There's something I want to tell you.

979
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:28,240
Mr. Ransom came out to see me
in Cambridge once.

980
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:31,925
We took a walk
and we saw the colleges.

981
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:37,265
I didn't like to tell you,
but now I want you to know everything.

982
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:40,633
What is there between you?
How can I believe you?

983
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:45,238
- You've deceived me.
- Olive, it was to spare you.

984
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:48,694
He wouldn't be here
if you wanted to spare me.

985
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:51,611
Do you mean that I brought him here?

986
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,752
I never in my life was more surprised
than when I saw him.

987
01:19:57,852 --> 01:20:01,813
- What has he come for?
- He's come to ask me to marry him.

988
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:10,170
Help me. Help me.

989
01:20:11,901 --> 01:20:14,716
Why not tell him plainly
that you love him?

990
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:19,004
Love him?

991
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:23,605
Olive, how can I love him when he tells
me he wants me to give up everything?

992
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:26,775
All our work.
Never again to speak in public.

993
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,609
He asks you that?

994
01:20:32,476 --> 01:20:36,600
- In just that way?
- No, it's not that way!

995
01:20:37,853 --> 01:20:39,130
It's very tenderly.

996
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:43,190
For heaven's sake, don't grovel!

997
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:49,788
How does he dare come in here?
Doesn't he know this is my house?

998
01:20:49,885 --> 01:20:52,504
Of course he won't come into it.

999
01:20:54,877 --> 01:20:57,594
He wants to meet me outside...

1000
01:20:58,974 --> 01:21:01,145
for just one hour.

1001
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,729
And I've told him I will.

1002
01:21:08,222 --> 01:21:10,971
He says he wants to know me better.

1003
01:21:11,902 --> 01:21:15,480
Oh, don't leave me. You'll kill me.

1004
01:21:15,582 --> 01:21:18,364
You must help me, Olive.

1005
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:37,212
Mr. Ransom, you have one hour.

1006
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:52,984
Here, boy. Here, boy.

1007
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:57,687
Nobody listens to me, see?

1008
01:21:59,935 --> 01:22:04,724
- Oh. Dammit.
- Are you all right?

1009
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,911
Let me.

1010
01:22:13,855 --> 01:22:15,743
All right.

1011
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:20,469
Verena, I need your help.

1012
01:22:21,055 --> 01:22:22,615
Nice and tight.

1013
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:27,576
That's fine. I've got it.

1014
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:16,853
Hello!

1015
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,054
Hello, Mr. Ransom!

1016
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,486
Basil, hello!

1017
01:24:01,506 --> 01:24:04,059
Olive wants us to leave.

1018
01:24:04,162 --> 01:24:07,261
Well, you tell her it's useless.
I'll follow you anywhere you go.

1019
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:12,251
If I ask you very nicely to go,
to let me go...

1020
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:15,134
Don't you see what you're doing to her?

1021
01:24:15,235 --> 01:24:17,853
I'm not worried about Miss Olive.
She's a fighting woman

1022
01:24:17,955 --> 01:24:19,929
and she's not given me
one inch of odds.

1023
01:24:22,499 --> 01:24:24,833
Can't I make you see

1024
01:24:24,931 --> 01:24:30,233
how much more natural it is,

1025
01:24:30,339 --> 01:24:35,674
not to say agreeable,
to give yourself to a man

1026
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:39,740
instead of to a movement
or some morbid old maid.

1027
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:42,626
Oh, no. No.

1028
01:24:42,723 --> 01:24:46,914
Shh. Shh, it's all right.

1029
01:24:47,011 --> 01:24:49,051
It's all right.

1030
01:24:55,779 --> 01:24:57,667
You know...

1031
01:24:59,812 --> 01:25:03,806
I'm going to have to be
tremendously nice to you...

1032
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:11,170
all the rest of our days
to make up for all this.

1033
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,682
Poor Verena.

1034
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:36,163
Come on now.

1035
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:40,825
Don't you understand,
it's not that he loves you,

1036
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:42,307
but that he hates our cause.

1037
01:25:42,405 --> 01:25:45,951
He wants to prove a man only has to
whistle for a woman,

1038
01:25:46,052 --> 01:25:48,671
for you to come running.

1039
01:25:50,533 --> 01:25:52,955
You're not even listening to me.

1040
01:25:53,061 --> 01:25:54,949
No, I am.

1041
01:25:55,045 --> 01:25:58,176
I want you to say all this.
I want to hear it.

1042
01:25:58,277 --> 01:26:02,619
I want you to make me hate not him,
but what I feel for him.

1043
01:26:04,453 --> 01:26:08,250
Oh, don't let's talk.
Come and sit here beside me.

1044
01:26:09,286 --> 01:26:11,173
Hold my hand.

1045
01:26:22,918 --> 01:26:24,925
You're waiting for someone?

1046
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:29,307
Why, Dr. Prance, I'm waiting for you.

1047
01:26:29,414 --> 01:26:31,835
- Let me help you.
- Why, thanks.

1048
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:33,851
What do you hope to catch?

1049
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:35,900
"The judge
had no sooner taken his seat

1050
01:26:36,006 --> 01:26:40,381
"than the officer on the floor of the court
called out 'Silence! ' In a commanding tone...

1051
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:45,827
"upon which another officer in the gallery
cried 'Silence! ' In an angry manner,

1052
01:26:45,926 --> 01:26:50,149
whereupon three or four more ushers shouted
'Silence! ' in a voice of indignant remonstrance. "

1053
01:26:53,126 --> 01:26:54,272
Oh, don't stop. I am enjoying it.

1054
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,508
Now, go on.

1055
01:26:57,606 --> 01:27:01,349
Mr. Pickwick rang the bell.
That's where we were.

1056
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:07,013
"Mr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell,
and a coach having been procured,

1057
01:27:07,111 --> 01:27:10,209
"the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker
ensconced themselves therein,

1058
01:27:10,311 --> 01:27:12,133
"and drove to Guildhall,

1059
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:17,021
Sam Weller, Mr. Lowten
and the blue bag following in a cab. "

1060
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:25,437
Don't you have to get back to the house?

1061
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:27,430
I presume you don't know
what it's like

1062
01:27:27,527 --> 01:27:31,008
to be one of four women
shut up in a small frame house.

1063
01:27:32,519 --> 01:27:36,960
And Miss Birdseye doesn't need me.
She's asleep a lot of the time now.

1064
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,742
Has she never wondered
why I don't come up into the house?

1065
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,979
Have you never wondered?

1066
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:45,894
I can't speak for Miss Birdseye,
but I don't wonder, Mr. Ransom.

1067
01:27:45,992 --> 01:27:50,400
If I did, I'd never stop,
this being the age of miracles.

1068
01:27:51,528 --> 01:27:53,983
You should hear them
up there in the house,

1069
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:58,081
getting ready for Verena's
great appearance at the music hall.

1070
01:27:58,184 --> 01:28:01,118
The music hall is a pretty big building,

1071
01:28:01,704 --> 01:28:05,283
but I guess it's not so big
as Miss Chancellor's ideas.

1072
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:09,759
I'm surprised Miss Chancellor
doesn't require more effort from you.

1073
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:12,133
She's given up on me.
She knows where I stand.

1074
01:28:12,232 --> 01:28:14,207
Where do you stand?

1075
01:28:14,312 --> 01:28:17,411
I guess the same place where you are,
only I don't matter.

1076
01:28:17,513 --> 01:28:18,920
Isn't that strange?

1077
01:28:19,016 --> 01:28:22,432
They think women the equal of men,
and yet they're a lot more excited

1078
01:28:22,536 --> 01:28:24,958
when a man joins
than when a woman does.

1079
01:28:54,217 --> 01:28:57,348
What a pity it is
that you can't say "damn. "

1080
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:04,262
Yes.

1081
01:29:22,986 --> 01:29:24,164
Hello.

1082
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:28,102
- What?
- Olive will die. It will kill her.

1083
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:30,886
- I can't be with you today.
- One hour.

1084
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:35,141
We said one hour.

1085
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:44,868
If you don't want me to appear in
the musical, you'll have to kidnap me.

1086
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:47,043
Why sing in the music hall
when you can sing for me?

1087
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:54,660
Verena!

1088
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:04,296
Verena, hurry, it's Miss Birdseye.
Get back to the house.

1089
01:30:04,395 --> 01:30:06,850
- What's happened?
- Sir, it's Miss Birdseye.

1090
01:30:11,212 --> 01:30:14,856
Do we know what happened?

1091
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:17,159
What?

1092
01:31:22,573 --> 01:31:25,508
She asked to be buried here.

1093
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,930
It's the only thing I ever
heard her ask for for herself.

1094
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:37,994
This is a queer place to give it.

1095
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:40,908
And I'm a queer sort of messenger
for that kind of thing,

1096
01:31:41,005 --> 01:31:44,354
as I don't cultivate the sentimental side.

1097
01:31:45,261 --> 01:31:49,156
- I have a message for you.
- From Verena?

1098
01:31:49,262 --> 01:31:53,670
She says she can't meet you for a while,
for three or four days.

1099
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:57,352
She wishes to be quiet
and think things over, she says.

1100
01:31:58,062 --> 01:31:59,950
I understand.

1101
01:32:00,718 --> 01:32:03,620
Well, I don't, but that's no matter.

1102
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:06,404
I'm leaving, Mr. Ransom.

1103
01:32:06,511 --> 01:32:08,747
I have to get back
and see my office slate.

1104
01:32:09,486 --> 01:32:11,309
I hope we can go fishing again.

1105
01:32:11,919 --> 01:32:15,017
That will be a treat.
But my place is empty in the city.

1106
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:18,315
I wouldn't have stayed so long
for anyone but Miss Birdseye.

1107
01:32:18,414 --> 01:32:21,481
Goodbye, Mr. Ransom. And good luck.

1108
01:32:45,711 --> 01:32:50,446
I thought Miss Chancellor would've
invited us to stay for a few days.

1109
01:32:50,543 --> 01:32:53,543
She doesn't want to inconvenience you.

1110
01:32:53,648 --> 01:32:55,786
I'll see you very soon in Boston.

1111
01:32:57,871 --> 01:32:59,180
You're looking well, Mother.

1112
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:01,767
I can't say I've been
keeping perfect health,

1113
01:33:01,872 --> 01:33:04,839
and the sea air would be very beneficial.

1114
01:33:04,943 --> 01:33:07,278
You have a new dress.

1115
01:33:07,888 --> 01:33:12,623
I was afraid it might be a little too
colorful for the melancholy occasion.

1116
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,792
We are anticipating great applause

1117
01:33:14,896 --> 01:33:19,336
on the occasion of Verena's appearance
at the music hall.

1118
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,662
You've chosen a fine subject
for her, Miss Chancellor.

1119
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:29,162
A woman's reason.
A very distinguished subject.

1120
01:33:29,264 --> 01:33:31,948
We shall look forward
to seeing you there.

1121
01:33:32,049 --> 01:33:35,529
And if in the meantime,
I might venture to offer my assistance,

1122
01:33:35,633 --> 01:33:38,928
whatever falls within
my humble means...

1123
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:41,414
We shall certainly let you know.

1124
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:47,630
Uh, Mrs. Tarrant and I feel it is our duty

1125
01:33:47,728 --> 01:33:51,852
to participate in the, uh, coming trial.

1126
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:54,539
Our sacred duty as parents.

1127
01:33:55,185 --> 01:33:56,712
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye, Mom.

1128
01:33:56,817 --> 01:33:58,705
Take care.

1129
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,113
Giddap.

1130
01:35:09,523 --> 01:35:11,279
Verena. Oh, Verena.

1131
01:35:11,379 --> 01:35:13,583
- I must see you today.
- I can't.

1132
01:35:13,683 --> 01:35:15,112
You go on, you tell her. Go on.

1133
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,275
I promised him ten minutes.

1134
01:35:35,315 --> 01:35:39,538
You must believe me, Olive.
My choice is made. You know that.

1135
01:35:41,619 --> 01:35:43,507
You must believe me.

1136
01:35:45,459 --> 01:35:47,347
What will you tell him?

1137
01:35:47,444 --> 01:35:49,331
That it's impossible.

1138
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:53,708
That I've thought it over and over,
and I can't, I can't, I can't.

1139
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:05,066
Ten minutes. That will give me time
to finish my letter to Miss Peabody.

1140
01:36:17,973 --> 01:36:19,598
Mr. Ransom.

1141
01:36:44,085 --> 01:36:45,972
Verena!

1142
01:37:19,286 --> 01:37:23,312
- Has Miss Tarrant returned?
- No, ma'am, not yet.

1143
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:30,162
It's getting late. I hope they
took the boatman with them.

1144
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:33,677
That gentleman from the South don't look
like he knows much about handling a boat.

1145
01:37:33,783 --> 01:37:35,692
I'm sure he'll take good care of her.

1146
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:05,367
Basil?

1147
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:20,376
Verena!

1148
01:39:25,241 --> 01:39:27,129
Verena!

1149
01:41:44,829 --> 01:41:48,723
I'm sorry to disturb you. I'd hoped
for a moment I might see Miss Tarrant.

1150
01:41:48,829 --> 01:41:50,487
Miss Tarrant has gone away.

1151
01:41:52,253 --> 01:41:54,293
I took her to the steamer this morning.

1152
01:41:54,397 --> 01:41:56,666
Oh, yes? Where is she going?

1153
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:00,188
I'm not sure I'm obliged to tell you.

1154
01:42:02,493 --> 01:42:04,598
Of course not.

1155
01:42:04,701 --> 01:42:08,630
Excuse me for asking. It is much better
that I should find her for myself.

1156
01:42:08,733 --> 01:42:11,581
- You won't find her.
- No?

1157
01:42:11,678 --> 01:42:13,466
No, I'm sure of it.

1158
01:43:12,095 --> 01:43:14,550
You there! What are you doing in here?

1159
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,468
It's all right.
I have a ticket for the lecture.

1160
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,542
For this seat here, C1.

1161
01:43:19,647 --> 01:43:22,013
I chose it so I could have the best view.

1162
01:43:22,111 --> 01:43:26,651
The lecture isn't until 7:00 this evening.
Please come back at that time.

1163
01:43:28,191 --> 01:43:32,893
Has the orator arrived?
Perhaps I might have a glimpse of her.

1164
01:43:32,991 --> 01:43:34,398
No, sir, she isn't here.

1165
01:43:35,104 --> 01:43:37,689
I understand she hasn't been seen
in a month. She's disappeared.

1166
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:41,501
She will be here punctually tonight.
You have my assurance.

1167
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,487
Will you please leave?

1168
01:45:11,106 --> 01:45:13,146
It's nerves.

1169
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,137
He's here.

1170
01:45:20,034 --> 01:45:21,976
- Don't let anyone in.
- Don't worry, miss.

1171
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:24,700
- There's no one's gonna get in here.
- Thank you.

1172
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:32,152
Calm yourself.

1173
01:45:34,147 --> 01:45:36,830
This isn't like you at all,
to be so nervous and morbid.

1174
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,581
It's more like me.
We seem to have changed characters.

1175
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:12,482
We're together, you and I.
We're together, Verena.

1176
01:46:12,579 --> 01:46:15,841
Trust me. Lean on me.

1177
01:46:15,939 --> 01:46:19,005
I'd be obliged if you take
my card in to Miss Tarrant.

1178
01:46:19,108 --> 01:46:22,403
It ain't much use. You're just
the very man she wants to keep out.

1179
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,605
I don't think Miss Tarrant
wants to keep me out.

1180
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:27,523
It's not her.
It's the other one, Miss Chancellor.

1181
01:46:28,516 --> 01:46:30,753
Could you ask the organist
to play a little longer?

1182
01:46:35,876 --> 01:46:38,015
For goodness sake, keep playing.

1183
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,947
I guess you'd better be quiet.

1184
01:46:47,908 --> 01:46:50,778
Quiet? Is it possible
to be more quiet than I am?

1185
01:46:50,884 --> 01:46:54,594
I've seen crazy folks
look a good deal like you.

1186
01:46:54,692 --> 01:46:57,507
Now... I wouldn't lose
the lecture if I was you.

1187
01:46:57,605 --> 01:47:00,387
Why don't you go and sit around
in the hall with the rest of the public?

1188
01:47:00,485 --> 01:47:02,819
- This lecture won't take place.
- Yes, it will.

1189
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:04,444
As soon as the organ stops.

1190
01:47:04,548 --> 01:47:06,436
Why the devil don't it?

1191
01:47:07,076 --> 01:47:08,004
Sir!

1192
01:47:09,221 --> 01:47:11,108
Verena! Verena!

1193
01:47:32,741 --> 01:47:35,610
There's a lot of dollars out there waiting.

1194
01:47:35,718 --> 01:47:37,627
That's a fact
that should not be overlooked.

1195
01:47:37,734 --> 01:47:42,240
I won't be able to bear it. My ankles
are swelling up. It's always that way.

1196
01:47:42,341 --> 01:47:46,018
Go and speak to them. Will you speak
to them? Give her a few minutes.

1197
01:47:55,077 --> 01:47:57,249
I'm here. I'm with you.

1198
01:48:17,062 --> 01:48:18,950
Ladies and gentlemen...

1199
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:25,404
I crave your patience for my daughter,
Miss Verena Tarrant,

1200
01:48:25,511 --> 01:48:27,900
who is with us in close proximity.

1201
01:48:31,143 --> 01:48:35,878
Trust me. Just me. No one.

1202
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:39,455
...will come to
enable her to bring you the message

1203
01:48:39,559 --> 01:48:41,948
which you have all come here to hear.

1204
01:48:44,199 --> 01:48:47,330
Is it any wonder that she is what she is?

1205
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:52,865
She was nursed in the dark séance
room, suckled midst meditations.

1206
01:48:52,968 --> 01:48:56,001
She had sat on the knees
of somnambulists,

1207
01:48:56,104 --> 01:49:01,887
she has been passed from hand to hand
by celebrated trance speakers.

1208
01:49:03,112 --> 01:49:04,606
Go home!

1209
01:49:07,591 --> 01:49:11,967
I myself have not been lacking
in a certain public notice.

1210
01:49:12,968 --> 01:49:17,191
And while we are waiting, you might
be interested to hear the report...

1211
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,142
Why in the name of goodness
don't she go on?

1212
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,095
If she wants them to call her,
they've done about enough.

1213
01:49:29,192 --> 01:49:31,648
- I have to go in for the Transcript.
- You can't go in for anything.

1214
01:49:31,752 --> 01:49:34,687
- I'm keeping this man out, too.
- Henrietta Stackpole from The Vesper.

1215
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,931
May I ask if you're
a supporter of Miss Tarrant's?

1216
01:49:37,033 --> 01:49:39,618
I'm her greatest supporter, madam.
You may quote me in the headline.

1217
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,338
Oh. How many times
have you heard her speak before?

1218
01:49:42,441 --> 01:49:43,903
About seven occasions.

1219
01:49:44,009 --> 01:49:46,213
Do you think she has a message
for men as well as women?

1220
01:49:51,144 --> 01:49:55,934
"A smaller hand and arm,
when next to a presented,

1221
01:49:56,040 --> 01:50:00,164
"dressed in a full-flowing
white illusion sleeve.

1222
01:50:00,553 --> 01:50:05,888
"This was said to belong to
Mr. Plimpton's sister, Mary.

1223
01:50:08,617 --> 01:50:12,545
"The blossoms were then distributed
between Mr. And Mrs. Plimpton,

1224
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:16,479
"each receiving a tiny bouquet
from the hand of the spirit.

1225
01:50:19,722 --> 01:50:25,286
"The hand then waved, bid adieu,
and while doing so,

1226
01:50:25,386 --> 01:50:28,964
"the slate was projected
by another hand,

1227
01:50:29,066 --> 01:50:33,670
upon which were written
the words 'goodbye. "'

1228
01:50:41,194 --> 01:50:45,056
We want Verena!
We want Verena!

1229
01:50:45,162 --> 01:50:48,937
We want Verena! We want Verena!

1230
01:51:01,707 --> 01:51:05,187
I have never seen anything like this!
What the hell are they doing in there?

1231
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:07,200
- This thing has gone on far enough.
- They're perfectly good-natured.

1232
01:51:07,307 --> 01:51:09,281
- Why isn't she up there now?
- It's her father who's up there.

1233
01:51:09,387 --> 01:51:11,809
If you don't open up this door,
I'm gonna smash it down!

1234
01:51:13,707 --> 01:51:15,594
Wait, please.

1235
01:51:18,155 --> 01:51:20,576
I'll see you tomorrow,
if you'll only go away now.

1236
01:51:20,683 --> 01:51:22,505
Let me go out there. It's only for an hour.

1237
01:51:22,603 --> 01:51:24,578
No, you're mine.
You can't take an hour out of it.

1238
01:51:24,683 --> 01:51:28,098
Is anyone aware that every
quarter of a second is worth $500?

1239
01:51:28,203 --> 01:51:30,592
They can have their money back!
Can't you give them back their money?

1240
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:33,034
Verena Tarrant, you don't mean
to say you're going to back down.

1241
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:36,361
Leave us alone.
Leave us alone for a single minute.

1242
01:51:36,459 --> 01:51:39,394
Just let me speak to him
and it'll be all right.

1243
01:51:41,035 --> 01:51:42,923
Olive?

1244
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:55,814
As soon as I saw you, I was paralyzed.

1245
01:51:55,916 --> 01:51:59,494
I knew that if I tried to speak,
I'd be the most dreadful failure.

1246
01:51:59,596 --> 01:52:02,629
It isn't too late.
Let me go out there. Please.

1247
01:52:13,804 --> 01:52:16,838
Where will we go? What will we do?

1248
01:52:19,629 --> 01:52:22,117
We shall take the night train
for New York.

1249
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:26,828
In the morning, we'll be married.

1250
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:56,419
I will take her place.

1251
01:52:56,525 --> 01:52:59,045
Are you going to speak?
You can't go out there.

1252
01:53:10,317 --> 01:53:13,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
colleagues and friends,

1253
01:53:14,638 --> 01:53:18,500
Miss Verena Tarrant
is unable to speak to us tonight.

1254
01:53:35,086 --> 01:53:40,782
What I want to say to you is
that when there is a great cause,

1255
01:53:41,775 --> 01:53:43,847
the individual is of no account.

1256
01:53:44,911 --> 01:53:50,727
You've come to hear
not the voice of one individual,

1257
01:53:50,831 --> 01:53:54,508
however sweet, however harmonious,

1258
01:53:54,607 --> 01:53:59,658
but the cry of all women,
past, present and future.

1259
01:54:00,463 --> 01:54:04,293
And like the great
William Lloyd Garrison said

1260
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:06,701
in his fight against slavery,

1261
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,469
I say we will be as harsh as truth,

1262
01:54:11,567 --> 01:54:15,244
as uncompromising as justice.

1263
01:54:15,343 --> 01:54:22,021
On this subject, we will not think
or speak or write with moderation.

1264
01:54:22,127 --> 01:54:25,902
We will not excuse,
we will not equivocate.

1265
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,277
We will not retreat a single inch,
and we will be heard.
