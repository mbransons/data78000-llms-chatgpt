1
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,940
(Sound of drums)

2
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,900
This way.

3
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,660
Court is assembled

4
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,460
by the Right Honorable Lords,
Commissioners of the Admiralty

5
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,900
and I quote: To enquire into the cause
and circumstances of the seizure

6
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,420
of His Majesty's armed vessel,
The Bounty,

7
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,180
commanded by
Lieutenant William Bligh

8
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,820
and to try the said
Lieutenant William Bligh

9
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,780
for his conduct
on that occasion.

10
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,540
Surrender your sword
and be seated.

11
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,820
Lieutenant Bligh.

12
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,020
Perhaps it would be useful if you
told the court in your own words

13
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,220
the events
of April 28th last year.

14
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,900
Yes sir. If it please my Lords,
I will first read a list of the mutineers

15
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,380
who seized my ship.

16
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
The crew is not on trial here,
Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial.

17
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,620
The question at issue is
how you came to lose your ship.

18
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,620
To understand that, Captain Greetham,
it is essential to know

19
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,540
who were the mutineers
aboard that ship.

20
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,300
Alleged mutineers.
Continue Mr Bligh.

21
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,060
Fletcher Christian,
Masters Mate.

22
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,820
Wasn't this Christian
a friend of yours?

23
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,820
He was, sir.

24
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,780
(Voices in crowd)
Fifty guineas says he's dead.

25
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,340
Sixty says he's alive.
I'll wager he's still alive.

26
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,860
(Voices in crowd)
How much?

27
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,460
We'll dine within the hour.

28
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,780
- How much?
- Sixty guineas.

29
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,460
Taken.

30
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,580
I'll be back to collect it.

31
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,940
Graham!

32
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,900
Fletcher!
What are you all doing?

33
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
One of our members collapsed.

34
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,700
We're betting
on whether or not he's dead.

35
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,620
What brings you
to this den of iniquity?

36
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,580
Is there somewhere we can talk?

37
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,940
It's a breadfruit.

38
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,140
Breadfruit.

39
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,980
The Admiralty has instructed me to take
breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.

40
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,980
Tahiti?

41
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,900
Fletcher, I want you
to sail with me again.

42
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,460
In what capacity?

43
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,740
The Admiralty's already assigned a
Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship.

44
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,900
He's a good man I think.
But I want you to be Master's Mate.

45
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,340
- If you agree, that is.
- Agreed.

46
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,460
Good, splendid! Good.

47
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,140
Why take breadfruit to Jamaica?

48
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,540
Cheap fodder for the slaves
on the plantations there.

49
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,580
Bananas are very expensive
there these days.

50
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,980
It lacks glory, William.

51
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,980
Well I don't have your connections,
you see Fletcher.

52
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,420
I want to make a name for myself,
before I'm too old.

53
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,420
And this green grocery trip
will make your name?

54
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,220
Now look, we'll go around
Cape Horn to Tahiti.

55
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,660
We'll pick up the breadfruit
then continue on

56
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,180
through the Endeavour Straits around
the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica.

57
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,220
And then back to England.
We'll circumnavigate the globe.

58
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,060
Yes, but why risk
going round the Horn?

59
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,020
Because it is
the quicker route, Mr Fryer.

60
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,980
Quicker if we strike the one week
in a hundred

61
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,660
when there isn't a storm raging.

62
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,740
Oh. So you would have us go the long
way? Around Africa and Australia.

63
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,300
There and back.
Avoid the Horn altogether.

64
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,060
(Sound of clock chiming)

65
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,860
What conditions
do the plants need?

66
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,060
Warmth, light and water.
I shall be giving up my cabin to them.

67
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,740
We shall be like little pigs
in a stye. Shan't we?

68
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,580
No sir, we shall not.
I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer.

69
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,940
I only say
the Bounty's too small.

70
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,500
We should have a frigate,
not a chamber pot.

71
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,460
Yes, and I should
have promotion to Captain.

72
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,660
But the Navy Board would
not heed either request. See?

73
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,660
Quickly now, children.

74
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,420
Ah, my little ones.

75
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,060
They've come to say goodnight.

76
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,660
Oh, goodnight,
goodnight. Off you go...

77
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,780
Aren't you going to say goodnight to Mr
Christian, Mr Fryer? Don't I get a kiss?

78
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,020
(Children giggling)

79
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,220
Goodnight, young ladies.

80
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,620
Goodnight, goodnight.

81
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,460
William a toast.
To circumnavigation.

82
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,060
To circumnavigation.

83
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,460
Circumnavigation.

84
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,780
And your safe and speedy return.

85
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,740
(Bligh) Yes.

86
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,500
(Crowd voices on quayside)

87
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,300
(Bligh voice over)
We set sail two days before Christmas,

88
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,980
23rd December 1787.

89
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Stand by to set the mainsail.

90
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,180
What are you staring at me for? Aloft!
Loose that mizzen topsail, lively.

91
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,420
Remove some of these gussets!

92
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,460
Back down in the rigging!

93
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,660
Stand by, you crew gunners!

94
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,660
Away, you crew gunners.

95
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,260
Southwest by south.
That's your course.

96
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,620
Southwest by south. Aye aye sir.

97
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,140
(Cook)
Right men! Food up! Come on.

98
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,420
(Crew talking) What's the name
of the cook? Lamb?! Hey, Lamb!

99
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,820
I hope
you got some lamb in that stew.

100
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,300
Hey, is it true
what they say about Tahiti?

101
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
You mean the women.

102
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Do they really go around
with no clothes on?

103
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,580
All they wear is tattoos.
In wonderful places.

104
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,900
True?

105
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,500
Cross my heart. Paradise.

106
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,580
Hey!
You're in my place, Quintel.

107
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,860
Move yourself.

108
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,340
Don't look at him.
There'll be trouble.

109
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,660
I said you're in my seat.

110
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,660
- Piss off.
- Bugger off.

111
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,220
- What did you say?
- Shut it, Churchill.

112
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,380
You keep out of this.

113
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,700
(Crew member)
Look out, he's got a knife.

114
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,580
Keep it quiet, Churchill.

115
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,140
(Crew member)
Keep it down, lads.

116
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
(Crew Member)
Churchill!

117
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,140
(Dog barking)

118
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,540
The King.

119
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,380
The King. God bless him.

120
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,580
To the ship. May she swim well.

121
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
The ship.

122
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,460
(Sounds of ship's timbers creaking)

123
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,020
The men are very quiet.

124
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,180
(Sounds of heavy thuds
and timbers creaking)

125
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,700
(Sound of crew member singing)

126
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,540
(Bligh humming)

127
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,220
Charming tune.

128
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,460
And a fine musician.
We're lucky to have him.

129
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes. He is not there
by chance, Mr Nelson.

130
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
Having him there
is good for morale.

131
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,260
Dr. Huggen. Another glass?

132
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,260
No thank you, sir.

133
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,420
You're uncommonly
abstemious tonight.

134
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,780
Well, more men have died
at sea from drink,

135
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,740
disease and dirt than
ever died by drowning.

136
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,220
Depend upon it, gentlemen.

137
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,820
I'm determined the Bounty
shall not lose a single man.

138
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,820
By heavens! I'll drink to that.

139
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,660
Then came
to one soft push.

140
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,140
Then came
the sweetest flower to find.

141
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,540
- Striking a superior officer.
- No I didn't.

142
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,740
- It's a hanging offence, sir.
- Sorry sir.

143
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,100
Can't be helped. We shall all get
to know each other pretty closely.

144
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,820
I wonder what we shall find out.

145
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
It depends how inquisitive
we are, Mr Young.

146
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,380
(Dog barking.
Heavy thuds, noise of fighting)

147
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,500
It doesn't sound quite right to me.

148
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,380
Do you think someone
had better go and look?

149
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:30,820
(Singing) There is a ship and
it sailed to sea. It's loaded deep. -

150
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,180
Good evening, Mr Heywood.

151
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,740
Good evening, Adams.

152
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,380
Evening, Mr Adams, sir.

153
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,980
Everything alright here?

154
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,380
Couldn't be better, sir.

155
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,940
(Sound of coughing)

156
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,140
My place.

157
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,620
Stupid buggers.

158
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,500
You watch
your mouth too, old man.

159
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,260
Don't old man me, Churchill.
You haven't got a lucky face.

160
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir?

161
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,780
Just leaving England.

162
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,060
Oh. Home sick.

163
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,460
- Feels you'll never see it again.
- Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck.

164
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,500
Sorry. Never been to sea before.
Two months ago I was still at school.

165
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,580
Never been to school meself.

166
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh.

167
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,900
Can't even read.

168
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,900
I can't steer a ship.

169
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,100
Any fool can steer a ship, sir.
It's just knowing where to take it.

170
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,380
(Bligh's voice over)
23rd December 1787.

171
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,500
The end of our first day at sea.

172
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,620
Tot of rum, sir?

173
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,220
No, thank you, no.

174
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,380
Come on, sir. We don't cross
the Equator every day.

175
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
No. Thank you. No. Make sure
Mr Heywood has some, though.

176
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,980
OK. That'll do.
Haul him in. Away.

177
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,740
Coming up for sup,
Mr Heywood. Sir

178
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,860
Here you go sir. Have some of that.
Have some of that, sir.

179
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,660
Revive the spirit as they say.
Have a sup of that. Go on.

180
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,260
Get some
of this muck down you.

181
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,140
Well done, sir.

182
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,980
Thank you, Quintel.

183
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,300
Lieutenant Bligh,
I have your log here before me.

184
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,420
In it, there is the frequent entry
of a single word: dancing.

185
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,060
Can you explain that?

186
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,860
I can, sir.

187
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,500
A crew on a long voyage may easily
fall into melancholy and violence.

188
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,780
I believe this can be relieved
by regular exercise.

189
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,660
So for 20 minutes each day, I had the
crew mustered and I had them dance.

190
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,140
- Dance?
- Yes. They danced.

191
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,060
An activity
they participated in wholeheartedly?

192
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,700
I think so. Yes.

193
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
And yet Mr Bligh,
in your own log,

194
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,540
you admit that this rather
unorthodox form of exercise

195
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,420
led to grave discontent.

196
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
On one occasion only,
sir. And not grave.

197
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,500
Charlie. If you only had a frock on,
I'd ask you for a dance.

198
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,380
Get your knees up, Quintel.

199
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,020
I'm doing my best, sir.

200
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,220
Don't answer back.

201
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,940
We're bloody sailors,
not bloody dancers.

202
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,380
Mr Christian. Mr Young.
Put a gag on Quintel.

203
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,220
It wasn't bloody me.

204
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,260
Don't make it worse, Quintel.

205
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,580
It wasn't him, sir. It was me.

206
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,220
Come along, Mr Christian.

207
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,060
You've got the wrong man, sir.

208
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,060
Churchill said it was he
who made the remark.

209
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,980
Gag them both.

210
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,300
Ah, Jesus Christ.

211
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,340
- Do as he says, Mr Christian.
- Sir!

212
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,300
Fletcher.

213
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,100
William, don't you think those men
have been gagged there long enough?

214
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,460
They were both guilty
of an act of insubordination.

215
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
I could have passed it off with
a laugh and have done less harm.

216
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,580
The Royal Navy is not
a humorous institution, sir.

217
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,100
And insubordination
is no laughing matter.

218
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,380
However, you may cut them loose,
Mr Christian.

219
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,020
But mind they appreciate
the gravity of their offence.

220
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,180
Thank you, sir.

221
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,780
Captain's orders.

222
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,620
Ah, yes. Sure.

223
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,940
You can close your mouth.
Or I'll put it back in.

224
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,700
I hadn't expected this from the Horn. Do
you think the weather will stay with us?

225
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
Perhaps.

226
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,020
It doesn't look much. Does it?

227
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,780
No, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen
the Horn when the waves

228
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,700
were as high as three houses
one on top of the other.

229
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,060
I once saw six men washed
overboard on one wave.

230
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
Someone on this ship
is very lucky.

231
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,380
Mr Fryer! Close reef!

232
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,460
Close reef, sir?

233
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,180
Don't argue with me. Close reef.

234
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,220
Close reef, Mr Cole.

235
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,860
Stand by to close reef! All hands
on deck! Move yourselves!

236
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,340
Hurry along and take those sails in!
Get further aloft!

237
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,340
Hurry up, move yourselves!
Get those sails in!

238
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,540
Doesn't seem to like
fair weather, does he?

239
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,220
(Cole) Haul on that sheet!
Get those sails in!

240
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,540
Mr Fryer. I seem to have
made a misjudgement.

241
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,980
You don't make many, sir.

242
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
Make sail.

243
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,700
Make sail, Mr Cole.

244
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:24,060
Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail!
Let go sheets and tack!

245
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,380
Square away!

246
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,940
Get aloft!

247
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,980
(Sounds of crew screaming)

248
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,740
Someone!

249
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,220
Mr Christian!

250
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,020
Pull! Pull!

251
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,780
Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert,
he's on fire! Someone douse him.

252
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,340
We'll all be killed!

253
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,140
All hands on deck!

254
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Close the hatches!

255
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,460
Take the wheel, man.
Steering to port side.

256
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,340
(Continuing shouts
of crew members)

257
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,020
Man those pumps!

258
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,820
Jamie,
hold that board. Someone!

259
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,300
Don't let go on the pumps!

260
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,820
Somebody get a bloody hammer.

261
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,460
Sir! Sir!

262
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,860
Have the carpenter lash
those things down, now!

263
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,180
- We must turn back!
- What?

264
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,660
In my opinion,
we should put about.

265
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,060
In my opinion we should not, sir.
We keep on our course.

266
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,060
(Fryer) You'll never make it
round the Horn. We must turn back.

267
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,420
Mr Cole, Mr Cole!

268
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,140
I want my opinion in the log, sir.

269
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,260
Mr Cole, have that lashed down.
And all the men on deck, now!

270
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,180
I want my opinion in the log!

271
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,660
Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's what
you wish, you shall have it.

272
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,580
The ship can't stand it

273
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,420
The ship can stand it
very well, Mr Fryer!

274
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,100
And how long do you think
the men can stand it?

275
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,060
As long as the officers
can stand it, Mr Fryer!

276
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,340
Get these things
tied down now.

277
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,660
Valentine! Come with me, boy!

278
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,740
Mr Bligh. How long did you
attempt to round the Horn?

279
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,100
31 days.

280
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,260
And how far
did you travel in that time?

281
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,260
85 miles, sir.

282
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,140
85 miles
in 31 days, Mr Bligh.

283
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,780
You endangered your ship
and your crew for 31 days

284
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,420
in order to satisfy your ambition
to circumnavigate the globe.

285
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,700
(Bligh's voice over)
My dearest Betsy,

286
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,620
Only to you in this bitter moment
can I reveal my heart.

287
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,580
I have failed completely
in my attempt to round Cape Horn

288
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,220
and circumnavigate the globe.

289
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,180
My doubts about Mr Fryer's
commitment to our endeavour

290
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,900
have been confirmed.

291
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,540
(Knock on door)
Enter.

292
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,260
- The men are assembled, sir.
- Come in. Come in.

293
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,300
I'm very sorry, William.

294
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,300
Oh. It can't be helped.
Come along.

295
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,340
(Voice off camera)
Lads!

296
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,180
We will go about and run downwind
for Africa and the Indian Ocean.

297
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,700
- Mr Lamb!
- Here Sir.

298
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,260
As soon as we have put about it will be
safe to light your galley fires again.

299
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,580
Tonight I want as much hot mush
as every man can eat.

300
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,980
(Cole) Let's hear it
for the Captain, lads! Hip-hip!

301
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,900
(Crew members)
Hooray! Hooray!

302
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,020
However. However. We're still
faced with a long hard voyage.

303
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,140
I mean to make good use
of every hour of sailing time.

304
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,540
And to assist me in this, I'm replacing
Mr Fryer with Mr Christian

305
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,940
who will now act
as executive second in command

306
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,700
with the rank of
Acting Second Lieutenant.

307
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,620
Mr Fryer, come back here.
Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here!

308
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,500
You'll dismiss when I have done
with you, sir. Do you hear me?

309
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,620
- This is an outrage!
- Mr Fryer.

310
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,660
In all my years at sea...

311
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,300
Your years at sea?
Good Lord, man.

312
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,260
If I had known your nature,

313
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,980
I would not have accepted you
as boson of a river barge.

314
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,100
Must I suffer this before...

315
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,100
You'll suffer my correction,
whenever you're at fault, sir!

316
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,820
What fault?

317
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,380
Damn your eyes, man!
You turned your back on me!

318
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,300
- Oh, for that I apologize.
- Very well.

319
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,220
- But I protest.
- You protest, do you?

320
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,540
I am Master of The Bounty.

321
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,140
And I am Commander, by law!
I am the first. Do you understand?

322
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,700
God damn your hide.

323
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,900
And now you may dismiss, sir!

324
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,220
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

325
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,060
All hands on deck. If you please.

326
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,020
Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise
to replace a professional sailor

327
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,460
like Mr Fryer
with a relative novice?

328
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,540
Fletcher Christian could hardly
be called a novice, sir.

329
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,780
The fact that he was
a good friend of yours,

330
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,620
was not of undue
influence upon you?

331
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,060
Let me know the intent
of your question, Mr Greetham.

332
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,820
We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh,
how you came to lose your ship.

333
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,660
I did not lose my ship, sir!

334
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,780
It was taken from me by a gang of
mutineers led by Fletcher Christian.

335
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,140
The man you promoted.

336
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,020
Yes. I promoted him because
John Fryer was grossly inefficient.

337
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,100
And he was also a coward. Fletcher
Christian at least had courage.

338
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,940
More, perhaps, than you ultimately
found to be acceptable. Eh, Mr Bligh?

339
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,780
(Bligh's voice over)
Friday, October 10th.

340
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,420
At half-past twelve today,
James Valentine departed this life

341
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,700
as a result of illness and fatigue
sustained at Cape Horn.

342
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,860
This after all my care of the men

343
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,060
is surely a result
of our drunken surgeon's neglect.

344
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,580
Oh, God. By whose mercy
the souls of all men rest.

345
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,620
Bless these waters
and absolve from sin

346
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,220
he whose body
we now confine to them.

347
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,860
Eternal rest grant unto him.
And may he rest in peace. Amen.

348
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,140
(Crew)
Amen.

349
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,660
Commit the body to the deep.

350
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,700
(Bligh's voice over)
At four o'clock, we buried Valentine

351
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,940
with all the decency in our power.

352
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,060
Twenty-five degrees.
Thirty-six minutes.

353
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,740
Land Ho! Land Ho!

354
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,660
Where away?

355
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,900
Dead ahead, sir.

356
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,500
(Cries of welcome from natives)

357
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,300
Stand by to fire the salute!

358
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,540
Ready to fire the salute. Fire!

359
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,700
(Sound of canon fire)

360
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,140
Stand by for a second salute!

361
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,940
Fire second salute!

362
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,140
(Excited voices
of natives and crew)

363
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,380
Hey. I'll have her.

364
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,180
Thank you.

365
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,260
(Sounds of drum beats and chanting)

366
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,460
Quintel!

367
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,460
Sorry sir.

368
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,660
Have you ever seen
a woman before?

369
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,900
Keep your mind
and your eyes on your work, man.

370
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,500
Come on, get in line there.

371
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,620
Oars!

372
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,820
Prepare to toss oars.

373
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,180
Toss oars.

374
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,980
Toss your oars.

375
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,980
Thank you.

376
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,220
Hail, Capitan Bligh.

377
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,500
Hail, King Tynah.

378
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,380
(Chief replies in Tahitian)

379
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Thank you, your Majesty.

380
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,740
I bring you greetings from His Majesty,
King George of England.

381
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,660
How is the great Captain Cook?

382
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,300
Captain Cook! He's well
and he also sends his greetings.

383
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,820
- He lives?
- Yes.

384
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,180
- He is my friend.
- I know.

385
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,740
Now you see.

386
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,980
Ah!

387
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,580
He gave me his picture.

388
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,660
Yes.

389
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,420
Some people say he was killed
by the people of Hawaii.

390
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,740
No, er... Captain Cook
is very much alive.

391
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,340
And, er, he's in good health,
King Tynah. He's very much alive.

392
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
(Responds in Tahitian)

393
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,300
As I said,
he sends his greetings to you.

394
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,460
And, er, he always talks of you
as his very close friend.

395
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,820
You told that
to this man... Tynah?

396
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,260
King Tynah, sir.

397
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,100
A savage King.

398
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,220
A King, my lord.
Descended from many Kings.

399
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,180
As our King George
is descended from many Kings.

400
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,780
Yes, in a way, sir.

401
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,700
Then why did you lie to him?
Why did you not tell him

402
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,660
Captain Cook was murdered
in Hawaii 10 years before?

403
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,660
Because they believe
that Captain Cook is immortal.

404
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,580
Literally?

405
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,300
They seem to regard
his likeness as a sacred image.

406
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,460
Interesting.

407
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,780
They also believe that every British
officer is more or less related to him.

408
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,460
So you were
more or less immortal too.

409
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:17,540
It would appear so, sir. And-um -
I also needed their assistance.

410
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,900
Captain Cook was our guarantor.

411
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,500
How long you stay in Tahiti?

412
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
About two months.
Round about the islands.

413
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,620
Stay here. Do not go to the other
islands. No welcome there for you.

414
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Everything you need is here.

415
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm much obliged to you.

416
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,620
His Majesty King George
has sent you many gifts,

417
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,740
King Tynah. Perhaps
I could carry back in return.

418
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,740
Gifts from yourself
to His Majesty King George.

419
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,580
Anything for a King. Pigs.
Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit.

420
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,300
Breadfruit. Breadfruit's
a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit.

421
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,500
I think His Majesty likes breadfruit.
Isn't that true Mr Nelson?

422
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,300
Indeed it is, sir.
His Majesty is a very keen gardener.

423
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,380
He would appreciate
breadfruit greatly.

424
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,660
If you were to send him
little breadfruit plants.

425
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,740
He could grow them
in his own garden.

426
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,980
(Sound of laughter)

427
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,500
We shall grow him
many little plants.

428
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,980
Thank you.

429
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,380
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

430
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,940
Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts
to King Tynah and his good people.

431
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,940
These are gifts from His Majesty King
George of England to yourselves.

432
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,620
(Christian)
Sir.

433
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,980
(Crew member)
Take it away, Mr Cole.

434
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,020
Oh, dear God.

435
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,380
- I hoped to avoid this.
- Avoid what, sir?

436
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,940
Dammit all man,
I'm expected to sleep with her.

437
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,940
She's one of King Tynah's wives. A gift
from one chief to another as it were.

438
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,660
Now look,
five minutes after I go below,

439
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,100
you must call me up on some
important business. Alright?

440
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,140
Yes sir. What business?

441
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,740
Business, dammit.
Any bloody business.

442
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,500
Welcome aboard, Ma'am.

443
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,580
Yes. Get on with your work.

444
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,540
She should soften
the old man up a bit.

445
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,340
Hot.

446
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,740
(Knock on door)

447
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,580
Enter.

448
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,260
Excuse me, sir. I...

449
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,780
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

450
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,500
What demands
my immediate attention?

451
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,180
It could wait until tomorrow.

452
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,220
What is it? Damn you.

453
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,780
The ship is sinking, sir.

454
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,620
Good.

455
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,700
Ma'am.

456
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,340
(Greetham) Was Fletcher Christian
at this time still your friend and ally?

457
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,900
At that time, yes.

458
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,140
There was no indication
of any resentment towards you?

459
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,100
No. None.

460
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,860
Mr Bligh. When you planted
out your breadfruit,

461
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,260
did not the savages carry out
some sort of ceremony?

462
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,860
An indecent ceremony?

463
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,420
Is this relevant, Captain Greetham?

464
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,220
My Lord, if the crew
were allowed to witness it, yes.

465
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,340
Were the crew present, Mr Bligh?

466
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,860
Yes.

467
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,780
And was it indecent?

468
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,300
It is their deep belief

469
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,420
that the earth is rendered fruitful
by the coupling of their Gods.

470
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,140
And that the Gods can be roused
by the coupling of men and women.

471
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,460
(Sounds of drums
and native chanting)

472
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,860
So it did begin at the ceremony?

473
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,820
No sir. Not at the ceremony.

474
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,060
No, it was Fletcher Christian
and the native girl.

475
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,780
You misunderstood the depth
of the emotion between them?

476
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,900
Yes. I realise that now.

477
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,180
I had assumed that it was
simply youthful passion.

478
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,500
It takes more than an infatuated
youth to make a mutiny.

479
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,140
It takes a discontented crew.

480
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,860
The crew were anything
but discontented, sir.

481
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,660
Fletcher Christian corrupted them.

482
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,660
Yes, but what made them
so easy to corrupt?

483
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,100
I don't know.
It was the place itself.

484
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,860
(Sounds of native girls
laughing and chattering)

485
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,140
Come here.

486
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,820
(Fryer)
Mr, Christian.

487
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,940
Come in, whoever you are.

488
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,420
Faya!

489
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,860
Captain Bligh's surprised

490
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:06,540
that he hasn't had the pleasure of your
company at supper for some weeks.

491
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,060
Do you still do that?

492
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,620
And the Captain says
he'll expect you this evening.

493
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,380
Today. Today's not Friday.

494
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,700
Six o'clock.
Prompt, if you please.

495
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,020
Areya.

496
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,620
Wait, Dr Huggen.

497
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,820
I found the most extraordinary plant
today. On the west side of the island.

498
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,700
Just by the mouth of the river.

499
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,140
Mr Christian, it is half past seven.

500
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,140
Well, you didn't wait for me. I hope.

501
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,300
May I ask why you have come
to my table in a state of undress?

502
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,700
Well, I couldn't wear the jacket.
The tattoo's too painful.

503
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,180
Good God.

504
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,580
Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.

505
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,100
It's very painful, sir.

506
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,500
Put on your jacket,
Mr Christian. If you please.

507
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,620
- May I serve now?
- Wait!

508
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,860
Thank you, Mr Christian.

509
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,740
Very well Smith,
you may serve now.

510
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,900
Thank you sir.

511
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,460
- Mr Nelson.
- Sir.

512
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,660
When did you last inspect
the breadfruit plants?

513
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,420
Yesterday, sir.

514
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Not today?

515
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,300
No sir. Mr Christian said a daily
inspection was not necessary.

516
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,460
Oh, did he indeed?
Well, Mr Christian.

517
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,180
And when do you think they will be
ready to transport in your opinion?

518
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,860
They'll be some time yet, sir.

519
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,700
We've already been here thirteen
weeks longer than we intended.

520
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,060
Will we never leave this place?

521
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,940
Because we arrived
so late. The plants...

522
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,820
I want to be advised of their progress
every day, Mr Christian.

523
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,740
Unless you need the time to cover
the rest of your body in pretty pictures.

524
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,580
Wait!

525
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,100
The sooner
we are seamen again the better.

526
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,980
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

527
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,820
Now perhaps you will join me in prayer.
Oh Lord, our heavenly father.

528
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,060
Almighty and everlasting God.

529
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,180
Most humbly do we thank thee
for what we're about to receive.

530
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,780
It won't be long now lads.
You'll all be on your way home.

531
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,340
You're not coming?

532
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,460
I fancy having a look at a few
of the other islands around here.

533
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,300
They'll hang you for desertion.

534
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,420
Only if we're caught.

535
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,260
You with us, John?

536
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:01,340
No. I've got a wife
and three kids back home.

537
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,260
There he goes.
Mr Bligh and bloody mighty.

538
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,500
How do you fancy the Endeavour
Straits? The Indian Ocean?

539
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,300
The South Atlantic?
The North Atlantic?

540
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,740
Nothing
but rotten biscuits and pork.

541
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,460
And his bloody lordship on your back
morning, noon and night.

542
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,100
Not me lads. Not me.

543
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,500
When do we go then?

544
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,660
Who's officer of the watch tonight?

545
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,660
I am.

546
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,420
Yeah?

547
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,340
Yes.

548
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,860
Well that's it, then.

549
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,540
Hey, Fletcher Christian.
Harami.

550
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,340
Maieva.

551
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,740
Harahai.

552
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,180
Thank you.

553
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,060
You wanted to see me, sir?

554
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,940
My daughter...
She has something of yours.

555
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,420
Of mine?

556
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:46,020
You are here now. Tamari.

557
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,180
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I...

558
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,580
Take this tusk.

559
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,660
When you see it, you'll remember
my daughter and my grandchild.

560
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,940
You will never forget Tahiti.

561
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:16,820
Fletcher Christian. Your wife.

562
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,180
- Think we should go as well?
- No, I do not.

563
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,540
Mr Heywood's going to have
to answer for this, you know.

564
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,660
Poor Heywood.

565
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,820
Hey, you bloody fools.

566
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,740
The Hottentots out there aren't as
friendly as these ones, you know.

567
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,460
Yeah. Come on lads.

568
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,740
Good luck to them
that's what I say.

569
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,380
They'll need it.

570
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,980
All hands.

571
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,540
Thank you, Mr Fryer.

572
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,300
Last night. Three men of
Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship.

573
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,740
The penalty for which
is death by hanging.

574
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:18,940
Mr Heywood, how is it you did not
see them? Were you asleep?

575
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,340
Yes sir.

576
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,860
Very well. You shall kiss
the gunner's daughter.

577
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,940
- Bosun.
- Sir.

578
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,780
Put this man over the cannon.

579
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,300
Do it now!

580
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,780
Aye, aye, sir.

581
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,940
Now listen to me, all of you.

582
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,660
In one week's time...

583
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,700
Hiya!

584
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:49,180
Stop that laughing!
Silence! You think this is funny?

585
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,900
You're a pitiful sight,
Dr. Huggen.

586
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,580
Go below to your quarters...

587
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,220
You think
this is a humorous occasion.

588
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,220
You are mistaken. From now on there's
going to be discipline on this ship.

589
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,260
We're going to have order.
And we're going to be like seamen.

590
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:22,260
In one week's time we will put to sea.
There will be no more grog.

591
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:29,180
There will be no more shore leave.
You've become a rabble, all of you.

592
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,980
And you will clean up
this ship and yourselves.

593
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,660
- Bosun.
- Sir!

594
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,260
Administer the punishment now.

595
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,140
Capitan Bligh.

596
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,860
(Bligh)
Mr Christian! Mr Christian, sir.

597
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:08,820
Sir!

598
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,740
(Bligh)
I wish to talk to you outside. Now!

599
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,820
(Christian)
Coming sir.

600
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,980
Thank you.

601
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,460
Is there anything wrong, sir?

602
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:40,100
Yes. Last night while the mate
of the watch was asleep, three...

603
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,380
Stop that noise!

604
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,260
Fiya!

605
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,660
Three men jumped ship last night.
Churchill was one of them.

606
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,140
You don't seem surprised?

607
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,140
Now that it's happened, no.
No, I'm not surprised.

608
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,420
I must say
I'm no longer surprised myself

609
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,860
when I see the example being set
by my first officer.

610
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,780
Just look at yourself, man.
Look at the way you're dressed.

611
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,220
Come on. You're no better
than one of these natives.

612
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,540
At least I am no worse.

613
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,820
I think your brain
has been overheated, sir.

614
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,820
And your body overindulged
in sexual excess.

615
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,180
I have done no more than
any natural man would do.

616
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,020
No. You have done no more
than any wild animal would do.

617
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,140
It always makes me laugh,

618
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,860
but when men lose their self-restraint
they say they're natural.

619
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,300
They are more natural than men
who have nothing to restrain.

620
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,620
Mr Christian, you will report
to the ship before sundown.

621
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,500
Is that understood?

622
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,620
No. No.

623
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:41,700
What did you say? You said no. Is that
what you said? Is that what you said?

624
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,500
No. Alright. You will report to the ship
immediately. Do you understand me?

625
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,820
And you will stay on ship.

626
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,700
There will be no more mixing with the
degenerate natives of these islands.

627
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,500
By any of my officers.
Or by any of my crew.

628
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,660
You comprehend
my meaning, sir? Good.

629
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:15,340
(Crew member) Keep em' coming.
Move it along. Don't drop them.

630
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,900
Come on, Purcell. Remember
that's what we're here for.

631
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,460
And the next one please.

632
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,580
Come on. Keep them coming.
Good lads.

633
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,620
Alright. Where are they?

634
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,380
I don't know yet, sir.
We'll find them.

635
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,060
Damn fools.
Don't make it worse for yourself.

636
01:07:58,180 --> 01:07:59,100
Stand up.

637
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,820
Stand up!

638
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,700
He can't, sir. Bit of trouble
with the locals out there.

639
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,180
You know the penalty
for desertion, mister?

640
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,860
We came back
of our own accord, sir.

641
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,820
You're a mindless animal,
Churchill.

642
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,140
I will decide your punishment
when you're fit to receive it.

643
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,220
Mr Cole!
Get Dr Huggen.

644
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,100
Aye, aye, sir.

645
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,460
(Sound of dog barking)

646
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,100
Sir. Over here.

647
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,540
Is he dead?

648
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,500
Yes sir.

649
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,260
Poor bugger. Alright, bury him.

650
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,340
Will you organise
that please, Mr Cole?

651
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,980
Fletcher.

652
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,300
I've come to say good-bye.

653
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,020
You do not come back.
Do you?

654
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,300
Ever?

655
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,180
- I must go now.
- No.

656
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,460
Not yet. Soon.

657
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,620
Eyes front, Mr Christian!

658
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,020
Off hats.

659
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,620
Take the men below.

660
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,940
- Make sail, Mr Fryer.
- Aye, sir.

661
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,620
Stand aside.

662
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,380
Stand down.

663
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,540
Stand down!

664
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,140
Come on, lads.
No sense in this.

665
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,260
(Sounds of ship's timbers creaking)

666
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:15,500
Well, gentlemen, between ourselves
and home are 27,000 sea miles,

667
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:18,900
the Endeavour Straits
and the Great Barrier Reef.

668
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,860
Now the crew is deeply
demoralised, gentlemen.

669
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,580
And I must accept,
as every captain must accept,

670
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:30,060
the inevitable and theoretical
responsibilty for that.

671
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,900
The actual and immediate
responsibilty, however,

672
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,420
I place on you,
my fellow officers,

673
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:43,580
who met this crisis
with lethargy, impudence

674
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,060
and flagrant defiance
publicly uttered.

675
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:55,820
And perhaps also for that,
I am to blame.

676
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:01,060
I counted on a strength of character
which you do not possess.

677
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:07,620
However, the cure
for our predicament is discipline.

678
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:12,860
And I shall apply it
with an even hand, of course,

679
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,780
but most
where it is most required.

680
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,020
Yes, well that will be all.
Thank you.

681
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,020
You may leave now.
Not you, Mr Christian.

682
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:33,220
Leave it. Now!

683
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:42,300
Alright, Smith, you may
go and close the door, please.

684
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,820
So. You think
I'm harsh with you, eh?

685
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,100
Look, I've been at sea many years,
Fletcher. Since I was twelve.

686
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:04,780
And I have seen many men,
many good men,

687
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,100
Iose their heads over native
women in these waters.

688
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,820
And I've never yet
seen it come out well.

689
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,220
Of course I understand
the excitement and... um.

690
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,140
But think to yourself, man.

691
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:24,260
Could you take a woman like that back
home to your friends and family?

692
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,620
No, of course you couldn't.

693
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,940
They're not like us, Fletcher.
You think I was harsh with you.

694
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:35,500
But you needed someone to show
you where your duty really lay.

695
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,980
Because you were
at a loss, my friend.

696
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:42,020
You may not thank me now
but you will later.

697
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,260
So, let's get the ship
running properly

698
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:51,260
and get back
to where we were before.

699
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,980
Now look, Fletcher.

700
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,780
Listen to me.

701
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,700
I am prepared to forgive
and I am prepared to forget.

702
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,380
Do you understand me?

703
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,380
Will that be all sir?

704
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,420
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you.

705
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,500
You sent for me, sir?

706
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:41,260
Yes I did. This ship is filthy,
Mr Christian.

707
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,500
Sir?

708
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,180
The ship is filthy, Mr Christian!
Look for yourself.

709
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,740
Look! Filthy, sir! Filth there!

710
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,060
And there! And there!
Look at there!

711
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,260
I understand you dismissed
the swabbing party.

712
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,620
You left these decks crusted
with grime. Look at it there!

713
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:06,180
Bloody disgrace.
Now you'll be well advised, sir,

714
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,820
to call them back again
and this time do it properly.

715
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,260
Do you understand me?

716
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,340
Filth Sir! Filthy Mr Christian.
Still filthy! Look!

717
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,500
I see nothing, sir, but your finger.

718
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,260
I'll not have your vile ways
brought aboard my ship, sir!

719
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,660
Do you understand?

720
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,140
Now you'll call up
the swabbing party, yet again!

721
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,940
And this time you'll make bloody sure
that the decks are clean!

722
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,780
Or by God
you'll answer for it sir!

723
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,300
I'll not have any of your filthy
gutter ways on board my ship!

724
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,540
Do you understand? Pigs in a sty
have more comprehension

725
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,260
or cleanliness
than you buggers have.

726
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,020
Now you'll get
these decks clean

727
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,060
or by God I'll make you
lick them clean with your tongues

728
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,100
if you don't mend your ways.

729
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:24,580
There is a thief among us.

730
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,780
Yes, there is a thief on board
this ship, which is unfortunate

731
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,940
because you know what hardship
that means for honest men.

732
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,940
Last night,
my personal store of coconuts

733
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,900
was well up
to the top of the netting.

734
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,380
This morning, I - Well
I mean look for yourselves. See.

735
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:44,100
Now if the thief will declare himself,
I will punish him alone.

736
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,620
And then
we can forget the matter.

737
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,460
Sir.

738
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:50,460
Hold your tongue, Goddamn you sir!
I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian.

739
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,260
Who do you think you are?

740
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,900
Now if the thief
will not declare himself.

741
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,980
I took one.

742
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,220
You?

743
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,300
I was thirsty.
I took one of your coconuts.

744
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,780
I thought it of no consequence.

745
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:11,260
One coconut, Mr Christian?
A dozen were taken, man.

746
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,300
I know nothing of a dozen.

747
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,060
Then, unless you're a liar
as well as a thief,

748
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,500
the rest were taken
by other members of your watch

749
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,940
who look to you
for their example do they not, sir?

750
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,900
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

751
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,420
Impound the personal stores of
every man on Mr Christian's watch

752
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,140
and put them on half rations.

753
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:36,100
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you. Stand down.

754
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,020
(Sounds of movement on deck)

755
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,020
That isn' t a raft,
it's a coffin.

756
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,620
There's a five-knot current running
between here and that island.

757
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:49,900
I'll take my chance.

758
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,940
You think a lot of us
haven't thought of this?

759
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,020
You're not the only one
to have left a woman behind.

760
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,540
Fletcher,
the men are ready for anything.

761
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:10,340
What are you saying, Ned?
Are you inciting me to mutiny?

762
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,220
If I were you,
I'd take the ship. That's all.

763
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,300
Why don't you, then?

764
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:20,260
I said if I were you. I'm not.

765
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:36,100
What I have to say to you is
the result of considerable reflection.

766
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,980
Its consequences
would be two-fold.

767
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,860
Firstly,
our journey will be shortened.

768
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,300
Which I know is a consideration
that cannot distress you.

769
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:49,940
And secondly,
upon its successful conclusion

770
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:54,780
not one of you in later years
will look back without a surge of pride.

771
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:02,540
We shall go with the winds
to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn.

772
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,020
You'll kill us all.

773
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,700
What did you say, Adams?

774
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,900
We tried the Horn before.
It was almost the end of us.

775
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,460
Damn you, man.
Don't you bloody cross me.

776
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,580
Mr Cole, take this man below.

777
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,500
And tomorrow we will assemble
to watch him receive punishment

778
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,260
for cowardice
and insubordination.

779
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,140
Mr Cole.
Take him below, sir!

780
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,820
You, Mr Fryer.
Give him the makings.

781
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,820
Sir.

782
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:52,380
Now. We set out to circumnavigate
the globe. And by God we shall do it.

783
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:57,700
To the greater glory of us all.
Is that understood?

784
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,700
Thank you.
Now you may dismiss.

785
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,180
(Murmurings among the crew)

786
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,980
(Knock on door)
Enter.

787
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,940
- Can I have a word with you?
- I'm busy. Is it important?

788
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:30,660
I think, yes.

789
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,220
Be brief!

790
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,660
William, about your decision
to go around the Horn.

791
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:43,260
William? Not sir?
Not captain? William.

792
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,820
I don't think the men will have it.

793
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,460
Oh, the men won't have it.
Are they in charge of the Bounty?

794
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,180
They might be if you insist.

795
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,580
Again. Will you repeat that, please?
The men might be in charge.

796
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,500
What are you threatening me with?

797
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,900
It's not a threat, it's a warning.

798
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,580
Oh. There are rumblings,
are there?

799
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,820
No. There is fear.

800
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,900
Around the Horn
is the easiest way. The better way.

801
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,460
And that is
how we will go. Anything more?

802
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,260
Don't put Adams under the lash.

803
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,860
He was insubordinate.
Cowardly and insubordinate.

804
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,220
He frightened the men.
I did not put that fear there, he did.

805
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,140
So he will be lashed
and we will go around the Horn.

806
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,340
Are you frightened to go
around the Horn, Mr Christian?

807
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,460
Are you a coward too, sir?

808
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,140
There will be no killing.

809
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:15,940
Except Bligh.

810
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,140
There will be no killing.
We set him adrift.

811
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:32,180
Hi. Christian's taking the ship.
Are you with us?

812
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,140
(Seaman) Come on, wake up.
We're taking the ship.

813
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,860
- Wake up.
- Mmm.

814
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,780
- Wake up!
- Whaa!

815
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:42,460
Shut up. Christian's taking the ship.
Christian's taking the ship.

816
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,380
We're taking the ship. Are you with us?
Come on.

817
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,060
Come on, Fryer. Wake up!
Get up! Come on, Fryer!

818
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,260
Mr Bligh.
Will you get up? Get up.

819
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,740
Get up!

820
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:14,780
On your feet.

821
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,380
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

822
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,380
Tie him.

823
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:21,660
What are you doing?

824
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,500
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

825
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,700
Come on, get up on deck.

826
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,340
Mr Cole! You'll hang, for this.

827
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:32,700
Mr Nelson.

828
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,540
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship.

829
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,620
(Seaman) We've taken the ship.
We've got Bligh. Get on deck.

830
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,260
Dance. Dance.

831
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:50,300
Easy.

832
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,020
Dance. Dance.

833
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,260
You shut up. Dance. Dance.

834
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,580
Come on. Get going.

835
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,020
You're a fool, Quintel.
You'll hang for this.

836
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,300
- Are you in this, Norton?
- No, sir I'm not.

837
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,380
Shut up your trap!

838
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,300
Desist this madness!

839
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,700
Be quiet!

840
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,180
Have you any conception
of what you're doing?

841
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,780
Just shut your mouth!

842
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,500
Are you in this, Adams?

843
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,460
It's all you fault. There was
never a coward on this ship!

844
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,140
You're a coward, sir!

845
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,620
And that was your mistake!

846
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,140
You're a blackhearted villian, sir!

847
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,580
Pritchard, get over here.

848
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:36,100
Stay there, Pritchard.

849
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,380
Stay Pritchard, you're a man.

850
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,580
Get over then.

851
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,780
Allison, get over here!

852
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,220
Shut up. I'm staying here.

853
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,780
Let's kill the bugger now, lads.

854
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,980
I said leave him!
You sodding bastards!

855
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,700
You take you hands off him!

856
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,340
Let's kill him.

857
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,620
Take your hands off him, now!

858
01:30:58,780 --> 01:30:59,580
Kill him!

859
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:02,460
Get your hands off him. Now!

860
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,820
Mr Christian,
I appeal to you sir.

861
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,980
Put aside this madness and it will be
forgotten. I give you my word.

862
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:12,980
It's too late.

863
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,580
Think of my family and
my friendship. Think of my wife.

864
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:22,380
I am in hell. Hell, sir! Why are you
being so damn reasonable, now?

865
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:28,740
God damn your blood
to hell with mine, sir!

866
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,180
God damn your blood!

867
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,420
Mr Christian,
get a hold of yourself!

868
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,460
You be quiet
or I will run you through.

869
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:34,820
Do it, Christian. Kill him!

870
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:39,980
Just shut your mouth! Shut
your mouth! I will run you through!

871
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,940
And then I will kill myself after.
You get him dressed now.

872
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:46,140
Get him dressed!

873
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,100
Bastard!

874
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,180
What's the matter with you all?

875
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,260
You be quiet!

876
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,900
Gun him down, damn you!
They're common criminals.

877
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,820
Get out of it, Cole!

878
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:03,340
You will be silent or
I will have you killed! You bastard!

879
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:07,780
You do and you will have
my blood on your hands.

880
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,540
Stop!

881
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:17,340
Quiet! We will get him in the boat.
Set him adrift. Get him dressed!

882
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,900
Will someone
give me my britches?

883
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,260
Pass us your watch up here then.

884
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:27,100
Come on, move yourselves.

885
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,220
You blackguard! Traitors!

886
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,340
Mr Bligh, come here, please.

887
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:48,540
If you wish to leave some
of these men on the ship,

888
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,940
I give you my word
they will not be harmed.

889
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,740
Lads. One of you will have
to come out. There's no room.

890
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,260
Mr Fryer,
you come up here.

891
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,980
(Seaman) We'll do without him.
We don't want you.

892
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,220
Mr Fryer. Get up here.

893
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,980
Stay where you are.
Or I'll blow your head off.

894
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,380
God damn you!
You're the scum of the earth!

895
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:07,860
Fulman. Get up here.

896
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,660
Come on, Fulman.
Move yourself.

897
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:12,220
Faster, man.

898
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:19,380
It will be fairly reported that you were
not part of this rabble. Thank you.

899
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,780
Smith bring that chest to me.

900
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,180
Do it now.

901
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,620
Get in the boat.

902
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,420
(Crew member laughing)

903
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,300
What use is that without charts?

904
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,380
I need the charts. Turn around.

905
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,300
You really think you'll be able
to command this rabble?

906
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,340
I'll do my best.

907
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:02,140
Well, I did my best
and I had the authority of the law.

908
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,140
You're a dead man, Fletcher.

909
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,100
(Crew members)
That's enough of that.

910
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:07,860
Get on the boat, sir.

911
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:12,620
Quickly.

912
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:15,100
You've not seen the last of me,
Ned Young. Take my word for it.

913
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,020
Thank you, Mr Lamb.
Or you, John Adams.

914
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,420
You've not seen the last of me.

915
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,100
- I wouldn't wager on it.
- We shall see, sir.

916
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:27,900
I'll see you hanged.

917
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,540
Veer them away.

918
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,060
- Did you bring anything, Smith?
- Yeah I got a carpent...

919
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:36,020
Veer them away...

920
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,460
(Cole) Get ready, boys.
Get the oars out.

921
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:42,700
(Mutineer)
Sorry to see you go.

922
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:45,620
Isn't this what you came for?
Here you go.

923
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,820
(Cheers and jeers
from the mutineers)

924
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:06,420
(Mutineer) Goodbye, boys.
Hope I never see you again.

925
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,300
If you get home,
tell my mother that I love her.

926
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,420
She's got a lovely
little Tahitian grandson.

927
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,340
Have a long ride, Tim.
I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer.

928
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,060
(Bligh's voice over) I hope never
to see Fletcher Christian again.

929
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,860
Unless it is to see him hanged.

930
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:02,140
How could he betray my friendship
and kindness to him?

931
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:06,740
I can only assume he has decided
to return to a life in Tahiti.

932
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:12,540
After taking stock of the meagre
provisions allowed us,

933
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,540
I have decided to make
for the island of Tafuha

934
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:18,780
in the hope of supplementing
our supplies of food and water.

935
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:22,940
By now,
there are many natives about us.

936
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:27,580
And by their manner, we do not expect
our welcome to last much longer.

937
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,220
- Mr Cole?
- Sir.

938
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,340
You take charge of my log...

939
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:45,660
and slowly make
your way out to the launch.

940
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:51,380
- Easy, Mr Cole.
- Aye, aye, sir.

941
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,420
Go now?

942
01:36:58,140 --> 01:37:00,060
Now. That's right.

943
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,660
(Sound of natives angry chanting)

944
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:16,540
You give me no summer,
my boys. Nasty bugger.

945
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,660
(Seaman)
Come on lads.

946
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:22,740
Get in the boat! Lose that barrel.
Stop playing games.

947
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:31,620
Is that what you want?

948
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,540
Everybody in the boat!
Prepare to pull away!

949
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,180
Mr Bligh.

950
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:52,020
Where's the captain?
Where's Mr Bligh?

951
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,220
Over there.

952
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,420
Come on then.

953
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:58,660
Norton come back. You fool.

954
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,260
Mr Bligh!

955
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,780
What are you doing?

956
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,540
Get aboard, sir!

957
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:14,860
Mr Bligh.

958
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:21,300
Get back, you bastards!
Keep back, you bastards!

959
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,900
I'll have your eyes for footballs!

960
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,220
Get back in the boat!

961
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,220
Help the man.

962
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,300
Get in the boat, sir.

963
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,820
My God, no!

964
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:59,900
Row for your lives!
Take your clothes off.

965
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:05,620
Throw your clothes over!
Bloody savages!

966
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:12,660
We're chops and liver
to them if they catch us.

967
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,540
That's the spirit.
Come on, we'll do it.

968
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:45,180
We cannot risk going ashore again.
What are we going to do, sir?

969
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:53,500
Well, we shall just have
to try and reach Coupang.

970
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,620
Without charts?

971
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:59,180
Well, I shall have to navigate
from memory, Mr Fryer.

972
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,020
It'll take us close to the most
savage islands in these waters.

973
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:08,140
The Fiji islands where cannibalism
is perfected almost to a science.

974
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:10,540
And from there,
my friends, God willing,

975
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:13,380
we shall proceed onward
to the Great Barrier Reef itself.

976
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,980
Then
to the coast of New Holland

977
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,100
and from there across
the Timor Sea to Coupang.

978
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,260
Now it will take us
at least two months

979
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:22,620
and we have provisions or more
enough to last us one week.

980
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:26,140
So that is the situation,
gentlemen. Plain and simple.

981
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:34,300
Well, we'll just have to make
the best of it. Won't we sir?

982
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,700
Make the best of it, Smith?
Yes, but will you?

983
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:39,340
That's what I ask myself.
Will you make the best of it?

984
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:43,580
Do you hear me? Are you prepared
to make the best of it? All of you?

985
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,420
Because all I can promise you, lads,
is relentless pain and hardship.

986
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:51,460
Now, if you're prepared
to make do and make sacrifices

987
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:54,620
and furthermore
are willing to swear by it,

988
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:57,900
I promise you our chances
of survival are fair.

989
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,740
You hear me?
You all say, aye.

990
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,580
(Seaman)
Aye.

991
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:05,700
Good.

992
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:09,580
Mr Fryer, make way.

993
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:14,460
Prepare to make way.
Make way.

994
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:21,260
(Bligh and crew
sing a sea shanty)

995
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:46,100
Fletcher!

996
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,580
Fletcher!

997
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,740
In the box are gifts
for the people of Tahiti.

998
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:31,300
We did not expect you back. We have
already given you everything.

999
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:37,420
We only want our women. And perhaps
some men to help me sail the ship.

1000
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,460
Where's Captain Bligh?
Why doesn't he come himself?

1001
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:45,500
He's no longer with us.
I've taken the ship.

1002
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,460
He's dead.

1003
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:52,020
No. No, he's not dead. We set him
adrift with some of the crew.

1004
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:06,420
You shame me by coming here.
You shame me.

1005
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,740
King George
will send many ships

1006
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:13,100
with many guns to punish us
for what you have done.

1007
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,260
We can give you nothing.
Go now.

1008
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,260
Some of the men would like to remain
here and wait for the next ship.

1009
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,540
Er, they wanted to go with Bligh
but there was no room in his boat.

1010
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:34,660
(Chief and advisor speaks
in native dialect)

1011
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:41,820
They can stay, but not you.
Take your gifts and go.

1012
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,340
(Chief speaks in native tongue)

1013
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,460
No!

1014
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,260
(Chief speaks in native tongue)

1015
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,820
Should she not be allowed
to choose for herself, sir?

1016
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,140
Ah.

1017
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:38,180
(Chief 's daughter
speaks in native tongue)

1018
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,180
Where will you take her?

1019
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:08,580
I don't know. Somewhere
the British ships won't find us.

1020
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:15,940
Take her. You will have
all the men you need. Go now.

1021
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,780
(Sounds of natives cheering)

1022
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,420
Goodbye, Peter.

1023
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,500
Good luck, sir.

1024
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,140
I think you'll need it more than I.

1025
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:09,780
Thank you.

1026
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:22,220
I'm not coming, Fletcher.
I've thought it out. And I'm staying here.

1027
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:27,020
Let's go.

1028
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,980
I think I'll stay too, sir.

1029
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,860
Get out. Let's go.

1030
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:34,780
Come on lads.

1031
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:38,620
They'll hang you.

1032
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:41,980
I might just have a lucky face.

1033
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:20,540
(Crewmen)
Here they come. Get it. Good one.

1034
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,940
Loads of them.
They're all over the place.

1035
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:43,580
Here we go. There we go. Go on.
Sod it. Who loaded these things?

1036
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:50,580
Come on, man.
Quick. Yeah!

1037
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,580
(Christian's voice over)
The only one I wholly trust is Adams.

1038
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,900
I go everywhere
with a loaded pistol.

1039
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:09,900
And where we are to head beyond
the reach of justice, I know not.

1040
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:29,740
(Bligh's voice over)
Thursday June 11th.

1041
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:34,020
In the afternoon we saw gannets
and many other birds.

1042
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:37,340
And at sunset
we caught one in our sail.

1043
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:40,420
Which I reserved
for our dinner next day.

1044
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,140
Who shall have this?

1045
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,540
Smith.

1046
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:51,820
And who shall have this?

1047
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:53,380
Mr Fryer.

1048
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,740
What about the rest of us?

1049
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:07,100
You just have to wait your turn,
Purcell, like everyone else.

1050
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,940
Some of us
haven't had nothing in days.

1051
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,500
That's enough, Purcell.

1052
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:14,660
Well, it's not enough for me, sir!
I'll tell you something.

1053
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:17,220
The officers
and their lot get everything.

1054
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:18,900
Shut your mouth, Purcell.

1055
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:21,500
I'm as much a man
as you are, sir.

1056
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,540
What did you say?

1057
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,580
I said
I'm as much a man as you are!

1058
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:27,180
Are you indeed?
I'm not so certain about that.

1059
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:31,580
Sit down, damn you!
I'll knock you on the head with it.

1060
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,620
Sit down! Sit down!

1061
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,500
Mr Cole,
give this man my share of food.

1062
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:11,300
(Christian's voice over) I am committed
to a desperate enterprise.

1063
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:13,140
I have said farewell

1064
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:16,100
to everything I've been accustomed
to regard as indispensable.

1065
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:18,580
But I suppose
I have found freedom.

1066
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:27,780
So you've found
freedom, have you?

1067
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:31,100
Freedom, retribution,
that's what you want.

1068
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:33,700
Isn't that
why you gave him your compass?

1069
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,060
I wanted to give him a chance.

1070
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,900
A chance to survive
so he'll come after us again.

1071
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:40,220
How can he come after us?
He'll be marooned on some island.

1072
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:44,180
I only wish to God I'd given
him muskets. Now get out.

1073
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,020
(Christian's voice over) At least
ten times we have touched land.

1074
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:01,980
Only to find either barren rocks
or hostile inhabitants.

1075
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:05,060
And once nearly ran
a foul of an English frigate.

1076
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,580
Our stores are low.
The spirit of the men, even lower.

1077
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:12,580
His royal highness
woken up at last, has he?

1078
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,660
Given you a rest, has he, darling?

1079
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,260
Fletcher wants you.

1080
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,620
Ned, I found it. Listen.

1081
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,740
Where is it?

1082
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:36,060
July 2nd, we discovered an island,
seeming uninhabited. It was

1083
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,900
well timbered. But we did not linger
for we could find no anchorage.

1084
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,900
That's perfect.

1085
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:44,380
Every ship in the Royal Navy has a
copy of that book and those charts.

1086
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:45,820
They never drew it on the charts.

1087
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:48,460
All they give is a latitude,
25 degrees south.

1088
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:52,220
Now it seems to me, all we have to do
is simply sail along this line of latitude.

1089
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,740
We'll find the island.
Somewhere.

1090
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:58,300
And if we don't? These men need a
home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once.

1091
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,540
Oh, they'll have a home.
Pitcairn's Island.

1092
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,220
They'd better.

1093
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:16,180
(Bligh's voice over) I can
no longer write for lack of strength.

1094
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:19,740
Commend me to your parents
and our loving daughters.

1095
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:26,220
Mr Bligh,
when my spirit is gone,

1096
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:30,820
there will be nothing
but flesh remaining.

1097
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:40,900
I beg you use that poor flesh
to save the others.

1098
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:45,340
No, no, Mr Nelson.
We're civilised men not savages.

1099
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,980
And as civilised men we shall die.
Have no fear.

1100
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:31,980
Sir, we'd like a word.
We've had it up to here.

1101
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:35,660
There is no island.
We want to turn back to Tahiti.

1102
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,580
And who'll navigate?

1103
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,620
You. You're the navigator.

1104
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,820
I'll navigate.

1105
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,300
This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island.

1106
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:51,100
Sir!

1107
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,820
Sir!

1108
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,820
Smith.

1109
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:04,820
It's land.

1110
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:07,620
- What?
- I think it's land.

1111
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:15,780
Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack.

1112
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,780
It's not proper
to land without identification.

1113
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,940
(Cries and shouts of natives)

1114
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:21,860
Oh. God.

1115
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:34,380
Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh.
I'm a British naval officer

1116
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:38,940
and I have
to report an act of piracy.

1117
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,300
(Native talking in Tahitian)

1118
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,180
(Christian answers in Tahitian)

1119
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:55,460
(Native talking in Tahitian)

1120
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:58,420
We've found it.
We've found it, Ned.

1121
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:02,020
It's our island.

1122
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:06,100
(Cries of excitement
from mutineers and natives)

1123
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,620
We could easily have missed it.

1124
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,060
Yes.

1125
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:35,180
We'll never get off this island now,
will we sir?

1126
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,260
Never see England again.

1127
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:49,340
This court finds that the seizure of
His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty,

1128
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:55,540
was an act of mutiny by Fletcher
Christian and others of her crew.

1129
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:02,780
And that her captain, Lieutenant William
Bligh, is in the opinion of this court,

1130
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:06,620
to be exonerated
of all blame on this occasion.

1131
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:13,540
Indeed, in the matter of his command
of the Bounty's open launch,

1132
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:19,740
we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his
courage and exemplary seamanship.

1133
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:24,420
Will you please
come forward Lieutenant?

1134
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:42,940
My Lord. Thank you.
