1
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:05,011
The 130th Spirit House gives
the neighborhood youth...

2
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:08,347
...an education in history
and a background in Islam culture.

3
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:12,617
The Spirit House is funded
totally through private donations.

4
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,964
May Allah guide you, brother.

5
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,932
Police! Police!

6
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,850
Police!

7
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,209
Damn, Odell!
Yo, man, this machine is fucked.

8
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,903
If it is, you fucked it.

9
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,881
Zapped my spaceship right off the screen.
Wasn't nothing even close to it.

10
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,076
Maybe it was internal malfunctions.

11
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,154
What do you mean,
"internal malfunctions"?

12
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:07,315
A spaceship doesn't have to get hit
to crash. Some get internal malfunctions...

13
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:10,291
...like when the astronauts
cash in their tickets.

14
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,829
Can I help you, brother?

15
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:43,289
That's the seat McVeigh was sitting on
the night Percy Williams shot him.

16
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,454
Don't nobody like to sit on that seat.

17
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,190
Something the matter, brother?

18
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,059
There's a power in that seat.

19
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,637
- Machine is fucked.
- Internal malfunctions.

20
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,273
Damn, did it again.

21
00:14:55,641 --> 00:15:00,578
They say it won't be long before all those
satellites they sent up there years back...

22
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,981
...gonna be crashing back down to Earth.

23
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,015
Insides wear out up there.

24
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,980
Things go haywire.

25
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,247
Oh, man, they just get tired.

26
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:14,359
You know, start out with this orbit
that's real high and wide.

27
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:17,018
Next time around, it get a little closer
to Earth.

28
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,221
Next time, a little closer and so on...

29
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:22,265
...until gravity hook into it,
and it come crashing down.

30
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:27,532
You hear some noise on your roof, and you
got a sputnik sizzling in the living room.

31
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,368
Get you something to drink?

32
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,605
Maybe he don't drink.

33
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:36,510
- Man don't drink, why'd he come in a bar?
- Man is a fugitive from a chain gang.

34
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,115
He got a hunted look on him.

35
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:41,117
The man's a wino, who should be
out on the street.

36
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,620
Damn, Odell getting hardhearted
since he owned this bar.

37
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,191
Yeah, Odell, ain't nobody after the chair
he's on. Let the man sit.

38
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,192
Got bloodhounds at his heels.

39
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:53,093
He's got internal malfunctions
if you ask me.

40
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,030
Damn, Odell! Look at it now.
Look what it's doing.

41
00:15:56,202 --> 00:16:00,229
Looks like that thing they hook up
to the dude's heart for surgery on TV.

42
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,397
- You broke it?
- I didn't break nothing.

43
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,702
Damn machine up and quit on me.

44
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,812
- Sure you don't want nothing to drink?
- I want my quarter.

45
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,076
You know what's on them satellites
come crashing down?

46
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,486
Diseases.

47
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:17,248
Diseases we ain't even got a name for.

48
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,583
Space germs.

49
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:22,159
Can't nothing live out in space.
Not even germs. No atmosphere.

50
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,819
- Odell, give me my quarter back.
- These ones can.

51
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,830
Man sat on the death seat...

52
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,763
...and he felt it.

53
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,070
The seat's got a power to it.

54
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,367
Sit down, Smokey.
You'll get dizzy again.

55
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,306
This machine has had it.
Give me my quarter back, Odell.

56
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,879
I loaned you that quarter
in the first place.

57
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,744
Hey, brother...

58
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,975
...do you speak English?

59
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,458
You'll get everything eventually.

60
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:01,259
Every time I come in here,
I bring that whole damn folder.

61
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,698
Birth certificate, death certificate...

62
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,804
...doctor's certificate, job certificate...

63
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,873
...landlord certificate, tax form...

64
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,942
...receipts, bills.

65
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,045
And every time I come in...

66
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:18,343
...the one little piece of paper I ain't got
is the one they want.

67
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,677
Mrs. Brown, I think...

68
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,412
If I was 10 years younger...

69
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,649
...I'd take another job
and be shed of the whole lot of you.

70
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:31,263
- Mrs. Brown, the only way...
- Man tell me I got to be recertified...

71
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,796
...because the regulations is changing.

72
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:38,232
Ain't nothing changing.
He just lost the damn form.

73
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:42,807
You look at that pile on his desk.
He can't even find the telephone...

74
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,840
...under that pile on his desk.

75
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,535
No way he gonna find my ADC form.

76
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,044
Mrs. Brown, I think...

77
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:52,048
He got egg salad all down his front...

78
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:56,154
...every time he talks to me,
and it ain't even lunchtime yet.

79
00:17:56,322 --> 00:18:00,224
Mrs. Brown, I'll take over
your recertification if you want me to.

80
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:04,386
Man wanted my folder,
but I wouldn't give it to him.

81
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:09,330
He done lost my whole life
under that pile on that desk.

82
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,399
Do he wash?

83
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,300
Mrs. Brown, I'm out of here
in half an hour.

84
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:15,804
Let's get this thing done.

85
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:19,570
They never should have let him
pass the civil-service test.

86
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,475
Man don't wash.

87
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,581
The man is deaf, the man is crazy...

88
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,343
...or the man is a wino.

89
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,954
Takes one to know one, Smoke.

90
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,152
Odell?

91
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,692
When did we have that
new sign put up?

92
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:37,886
Let me see...

93
00:18:38,063 --> 00:18:41,328
That was the day Mookie Wilson
stole home.

94
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,593
- Late August.
- Yeah.

95
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,532
I can't find the bill.

96
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:48,832
That's because your cousin put it up,
and he can't write.

97
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,135
Don't be smart.

98
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,644
What you want for dinner?

99
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,508
You mean, what do I want...

100
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,411
...or what do I want
that you can cook?

101
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,751
Well, in that case, where are you
taking me for dinner?

102
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,185
What do you wanna have?

103
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,758
You mean, what do I want
or what do I want...

104
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,190
...that you can afford?

105
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,459
Smokey! What is he doing?

106
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,828
Diagnosis.

107
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,337
Diagnosis.

108
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,367
Pour me a drink, Odell. Scotch.

109
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,202
Maybe it's rested up now.

110
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,401
Give me another quarter, Odell.

111
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,207
Here. Just gonna bust it up some more.

112
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,209
How about...

113
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,977
...Chinese food?
Think you can handle that?

114
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,780
Long as the menu's in English.

115
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:39,982
- I don't eat anything I can't pronounce.
- Oh, this man.

116
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,762
What are you doing
with that drink, Smokey?

117
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,863
Diagnosis.

118
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:01,806
Crazy.

119
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:06,717
The man is definitely crazy.

120
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,521
How about...

121
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,452
...Szechuan West?

122
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,856
- I don't go down there.
- Come on. Don't be that way.

123
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,758
Baby, you name me one thing,
one thing...

124
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,923
...they got below 110th Street
that we ain't got up here.

125
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,865
- You name it, I'll stock it in the bar.
- What's cooking?

126
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,664
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

127
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,808
- What it is, brother?
- All right.

128
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,674
Touchdown.

129
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,712
- My man.
- Man's still got them soft hands.

130
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,906
Hey, Bernice. Smokey.

131
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,311
Hi, Sam.

132
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,511
Try not to break anything valuable.

133
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,747
Just in time.
We got a client for you.

134
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,051
I'm off duty.

135
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,388
Check out the guy in the corner.

136
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,564
Who's his tailor?

137
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,460
Man's crazy. I gave him a test.

138
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,159
He don't talk, neither.

139
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,965
- What am I supposed to do?
- You the city, Sam.

140
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,767
Figure out where to put him.

141
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,876
- Men's shelter?
- Too smelly.

142
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,807
Okay, the Hilton.
You got the tab?

143
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:10,176
- What they pay you for?
- I just make phone calls.

144
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:14,080
- You want him out, you could call the cops.
- Cops? Oh, man.

145
00:21:14,253 --> 00:21:17,188
He knew the death seat
when he sat down on it.

146
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:21,258
It's not like I got to drum up
more business for the city, you know?

147
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,237
Hi.

148
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,746
- What's your name?
- Man don't talk, Sam.

149
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,423
- What's that he talking?
- Man might be Haitian.

150
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,627
Damn Haitians got diseases, man.

151
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:08,364
Voodoo germs. You drank out of
that glass he touched.

152
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,337
He ain't no Haitian.

153
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,444
Can you talk?

154
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,541
Nod your head yes or no.

155
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:20,048
Only people got worse diseases
than the Haitians is the Polynesians.

156
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,052
- This is yes.
- Them poor suckers got leprosy.

157
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,019
This is no.

158
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,181
Can you talk?

159
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:32,362
You got leprosy,
first thing happens, your penis drops off.

160
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:35,864
You can't talk,
but you can understand.

161
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,731
Damn, damn, damn!
Bust again.

162
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,462
Get this thing fixed, Odell.

163
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:44,166
Only you play here.
You don't even use your own quarters.

164
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,437
Who wants to waste quarters
on a machine that always busts?

165
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,046
He got up on his feet.

166
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:51,079
After it drop off...

167
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,048
...they just don't seem
to care no more.

168
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,789
He's messing with the space shooter.

169
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:02,256
You go to them Polynesian islands,
you see some long faces, man.

170
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:06,228
Don't never go drinking out of
somebody else's glass, Smokey.

171
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,990
He fixed it!

172
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,101
The brother fixed it.

173
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,331
How you do that, man?

174
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,408
Say, brother...

175
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:21,944
...how did you fix that machine?

176
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:25,948
You don't send somebody who can
fix a machine to no damn shelter.

177
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,483
The brother got talent.

178
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:31,214
Sam, Bobby's wife been taking in
boarders now and then.

179
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,881
- Bobby Carter's wife?
- Yeah. Big white girl.

180
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,358
- She's in ADC. She better watch her ass.
- You a cop or something?

181
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:42,228
- Hey, the thing work, Odell.
- I just don't want her to lose her benefits.

182
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,599
Another thing you don't wanna do
is sit on no Polynesian toilet, neither.

183
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:51,835
Walter, you a space shot. You know that?
You cruising the stratosphere.

184
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,978
You know how to fix things?

185
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,305
- Man's got talent.
- Where you from, bro?

186
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,584
Up.

187
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,420
- Uptown?
- South Bronx.

188
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:11,791
- They all crazy up there.
- What if he's dangerous?

189
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,990
- It's just her, the kid and Bobby's mother.
- Dangerous?

190
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,635
You're a real pussy
since you moved downtown.

191
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:20,795
- Come back home, it's all dangerous.
- I never lived here.

192
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,668
- Sam's from Englewood.
- What's that?

193
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:25,002
It's in New Jersey.

194
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,171
You let people know that?

195
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:34,217
I hear playing those machines too much
does something to your brain cells.

196
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,580
Look here, Sam.

197
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:39,588
I think she's charging $50 a week,
room and board.

198
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,357
You got any money?

199
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,358
You the city, Sam. You pay for him.

200
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,588
Every man's got a talent.

201
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,391
Yep.

202
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:48,692
Yours is drinking.

203
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,461
Yeah, and I'm the best too.

204
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,195
Hey, Sam.

205
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:58,434
- Don't tell Bernice.
- Make some calls, Sam. Get the man a job.

206
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:02,975
- While you're at it, get me one too.
- Ten to 6, Walter.

207
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:05,173
Thank you, sir.

208
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:09,254
If my wife calls,
I have not been here.

209
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:12,515
In this bar or on this planet?

210
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,088
I'll walk him over.
It's on my way to the subway.

211
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:20,888
Come on.

212
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,692
- Come on, brother.
- Sam, you got a quarter I could borrow?

213
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,531
Say hi to Snow White.

214
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,764
David's cookies.

215
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:32,138
Come on. See you later, guys.

216
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,336
If I was you...

217
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,981
...I'd throw that glass away.

218
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,250
I can't promise you anything,
but I'll make some phone calls.

219
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:51,829
I'm afraid you'll have to go through
some paperwork.

220
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:56,658
I hate to do this to you,
but I got to cover my ass on this one.

221
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:01,431
We'll get you set up somewheres,
but it takes a little time.

222
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:05,743
Hey, brother.

223
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:08,971
Come on, man.
It's been a long day.

224
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,588
I got a few ideas on jobs
if you can really fix things.

225
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:19,553
If this doesn't pan out,
I'll take you to the men's shelter.

226
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,784
Nice pants, man!

227
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,862
Pajamas and shit, man!

228
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,627
Change that shit, man!

229
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,292
You don't talk, huh?
Well, that's good.

230
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:34,905
You don't talk,
you don't talk people into things.

231
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,564
You don't talk, you don't lie.

232
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:40,268
My Bobby, he's living with this other girl.

233
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:43,812
He's always talking people into things.
He's great at that.

234
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:46,678
If they had it in the Olympics,
he'd win a gold medal.

235
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:48,683
Bobby, Bobby.

236
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:52,187
I met him at this place.
He comes up and starts talking.

237
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:55,292
Next thing you know,
I'm big as a house with Little Earl.

238
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,792
Bobby's sweet if he doesn't
get bored with you...

239
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,955
...or see something better
across the street.

240
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,122
You eat pork?

241
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,766
You're out of luck tonight,
because that's what we're having.

242
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:10,500
Of course, you don't talk,
so you can't complain, right?

243
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:16,805
Mother's going to complain.
Like she's some gourmet cook.

244
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:18,176
I cut my knee.

245
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,049
My philosophy is, you got complaints,
you go eat somewheres else.

246
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,621
My mama made us clean our plates
every night...

247
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,816
...and she couldn't cook worth shit.

248
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,427
She couldn't even cook pudding.

249
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:34,554
She'd cook chocolate pudding,
and there'd be these lumps like tumors.

250
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:38,635
Like what people with
breast cancer have cut out.

251
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,606
<i>Look here, muscle-brain,</i>
<i>you pour the water down...</i>

252
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,908
<i>... and mop head will stand under</i>
<i>and see if it leaks.</i>

253
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,073
<i>Watch out!</i>

254
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,775
There were six of us.

255
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:58,821
I'm from Alabama. Can you handle that?
Pidcock, Alabama.

256
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,493
I'm taking care of the old lady
and Little Earl...

257
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:05,061
...and he's off making time
with some girl.

258
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,666
Doesn't have any more sense
than I did when I was her age.

259
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,029
If they could see me now.

260
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:14,764
Where you from? You look like
you might be from the South.

261
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,844
No way I'm going back there.

262
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:22,606
Not with Little Earl, I'm not.

263
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:24,339
I burned my bridges.

264
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:28,043
Here. You look like you might be
about Bobby's size.

265
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,247
Serves him right. He didn't even
come by to pick up his stuff.

266
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:36,258
You know, this stuff
is going to rot your brain.

267
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:43,256
Sometimes I feel like I've been
taken for a slave.

268
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,063
They have them, white slaves.

269
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:50,368
The Arabs keep them.
It's like a whole other world up here.

270
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,942
A whole other planet.

271
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,909
With all the talking he did,
Bobby never told me...

272
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,312
...how I couldn't go back.
Not unless I give up Little Earl.

273
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,748
And that's one thing I'm not
ever gonna do.

274
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,186
That's the one thing Bobby gave me
that he didn't take back later.

275
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:13,025
I gotta stay and keep Little Earl safe
from all that mess outside.

276
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,432
Shoes are almost new.
He didn't wear them but once or twice.

277
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:23,731
His mother's okay, you know.
She's got a good heart.

278
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:28,039
But she resents it because she thinks
I drove Bobby away from her.

279
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:31,444
He couldn't wait to get out.
He said it was like being in jail.

280
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:35,211
And now he says he's really in love
and all this stuff.

281
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:41,019
Like he doesn't remember that he said
the same things to me when we first met.

282
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:45,558
Like I got no memory.
Like I got no feelings.

283
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,667
The worst is being alone here all day.

284
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,497
Little Earl. Yeah, but he talks
just about as much as you do.

285
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,666
And when he does, he's 5 years old.

286
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:04,479
Sometimes, I just think I am gonna
go crazy living up here like this.

287
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:06,650
You eat pork?

288
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,936
Three-toe.

289
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:06,302
- Boy didn't marry her for her cooking.
- He didn't marry me, period.

290
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,451
You're lucky you missed the rain.

291
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:20,857
Who's that?

292
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:22,650
Boarder.

293
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:27,995
- What's his name?
- I don't know. He doesn't talk.

294
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:32,432
They brung him over from Odell's.
He's nice.

295
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,273
What's he wearing Robert's clothes for?

296
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:39,105
They fit.

297
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:44,176
What's Robert gonna say, he sees
somebody walking around in his clothes?

298
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:48,749
Bobby's got himself a new wardrobe.
He don't care, Mama.

299
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,958
You gonna work this weekend?

300
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,787
- Looks like it.
- Well, sit down and put your feet up.

301
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,190
I'll bring you some dinner.

302
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:01,763
<i>- Bright, white lights streaking over</i>
<i>the Statue of Liberty.</i>

303
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:05,903
<i>Government officials attribute the UFO</i>
<i>sightings to commercial air traffic...</i>

304
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,901
<i>... and clear atmospheric conditions.</i>

305
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:13,908
If Big Earl was still living,
he'd straighten that boy out fast.

306
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:19,175
- See you got the TV fixed.
- No, it just fixed itself.

307
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:23,287
Girl, nothing in this world fix itself.

308
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,590
Little Earl, take your nose away
from that machine.

309
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,024
Come give your Grandma some sugar.

310
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:48,110
- Where's his tools?
- You need tools?

311
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:51,443
- Everybody needs tools.
- Look, just let him try it.

312
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:56,349
- Lf he doesn't fix anything, it won't cost you.
- He doesn't have parts. You need parts.

313
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,045
Come on.

314
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:03,755
What's it gonna hurt? You might
even get some cheap repairs out of it.

315
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:06,653
Hector!

316
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:10,358
We're in the Job Corps.
Come and get this guy.

317
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:23,080
Here it is, brother. Pinball graveyard.

318
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:27,650
I've been bugging Mr. Lowe
to unload these turkeys for months.

319
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:35,222
Mr. Lowe says you don't talk.

320
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:23,106
Hey, you looking for the outlet, brother?
There it is right here.

321
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,318
You gonna fix these machines, brother,
or what?

322
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,291
There she go again.

323
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:51,034
That's the reason why these suckers
are all on the blink.

324
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:56,435
That girl. She can play all day on a quarter
if she don't get bored.

325
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,237
Wears the machines down.
I mean, she's in here <i>todo los dias</i>...

326
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,972
...like a fucking zombie.

327
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:11,986
Hey, you must be from Carolina, Puerto Rico.
That's where all the brothers come from.

328
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:15,718
You know? Like Clemente.
He was out of this world, man.

329
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:20,593
He made it to the top without a knife
or a gun. He used a baseball bat.

330
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,357
Yeah.

331
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:26,498
Anyway, Mr. Lowe
is a weasel-dick motherfucker.

332
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,798
So you watch your ass with him, okay?

333
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,873
And if you need anything...

334
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,343
...<i>llama</i> Hector.

335
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,864
It's a whole new breed coming up.

336
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,209
They don't know.

337
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:10,942
Young bloods got no sense of history,
coming up.

338
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:15,312
They give themselves
some African-sounding name.

339
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:20,481
Jamocha Ali, Rashid Quadruple X.

340
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,891
- They think they're in touch with the past.
- Don't start up with that again, Walter.

341
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:26,462
It messes with my game.

342
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,331
I remember when there was history here.

343
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,663
Go light on them cookies, Smoke.

344
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:38,468
- Suckers cost a fortune.
- They're good, though.

345
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,170
Yeah, this was where it was, Fly.

346
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:44,144
- Harlem was the place.
- Still is, Walter.

347
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,909
- Not like it was.
- Ain't nothing like it was.

348
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:50,350
That's history, man.
Don't stand still for nobody.

349
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:54,752
Yeah, this is where it was, Fly.

350
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,986
Harlem was the end of the line.

351
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:01,097
I don't see nobody here going nowheres.

352
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,203
Yeah. You hit Harlem, you had made it.

353
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,770
Smokey remembers. Don't you, Smoke?

354
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,739
Some days I do. Some days I don't.

355
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:15,471
I'd rather be a cockroach
on a baseboard up here...

356
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,478
...than the emperor of Mississippi.

357
00:37:17,649 --> 00:37:19,776
I remember certain Saturday nights.

358
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,681
I was a little boy
peeking around my mama's legs.

359
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,789
What it was? It was elegant.

360
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,892
- Harlem was the place.
- Yeah.

361
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,898
End of the line.

362
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:21,673
Beer.

363
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:23,937
What kind?

364
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:25,982
Draft.

365
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,087
On the rocks.

366
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:33,421
Have you seen this man?

367
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:37,652
We have reason to believe
he's been in here.

368
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,797
Lots of people been in here.

369
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,989
- What's his name?
- Didn't he tell you?

370
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,067
How a man gonna tell you his name
when he can't talk?

371
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:49,070
Where is he?

372
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,107
Look, y'all got any kind of ID?

373
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:54,743
- ID?
- Your badges, man.

374
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,174
- Badges?
- What badges?

375
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:58,406
We don't have to show you any badges.

376
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:02,349
- Look, if you're dicks, you got badges.
- What makes you think we're dicks?

377
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,421
I could answer that.

378
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,590
If you ain't dicks, why am I talking to you?

379
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,286
- Government.
- Whose government?

380
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,058
- Immigration.
- We have reason to believe this man...

381
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:19,192
...is an illegal alien.
- So is half the fucking city. So what?

382
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:24,504
Could we see your green card, mister?

383
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:26,541
Green card?

384
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,772
Man, what you talking, green card?
Green card, my black ass!

385
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:35,351
My people built this country, sucker!
You ever been to South Carolina, huh?

386
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,512
- My people built that.
- Can't build a state, man.

387
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,090
When they got off the boat,
nothing was there.

388
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,524
Now there's shopping malls
and what's that shit? Miniature golf.

389
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:47,654
From nothing! Ask me for a green card.

390
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,596
My people was in the Revolution, Jim!

391
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,229
How long you been here?

392
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,784
Keep the change, sport.

393
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:19,729
That's $2, man.

394
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,900
We'll be back.

395
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:57,230
White folks get stranger all the time.

396
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:01,301
Hey, taking lunch now, okay?

397
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:05,738
- How's the colored fella doing in the back?
- Haven't heard a peep out of him.

398
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,107
The colored are clever with their hands,
but they forget things.

399
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:11,943
This one forgot his tools.
No management skills.

400
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:18,615
English, Hector.
<i>Se habla</i> English here!

401
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,088
How's it going in here, brother?

402
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:33,968
You've been a busy man!

403
00:41:47,752 --> 00:41:52,155
Since you're all finished, how's about
you keep a lid on the kids while I get a bite?

404
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:57,151
All you gotta do is make change.
You know how to make change, don't you?

405
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:02,557
Hector will be back 10 minutes late, as usual.

406
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:06,533
The Spanish give you a good day's work,
but they got no sense of time.

407
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:40,666
Are you the new fix-it man?

408
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:44,470
Fast as you can fix these things,
I can wear them down.

409
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,902
They don't make them fast enough.

410
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:49,979
I'm playing, like, warp 10
on everything in here.

411
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:55,915
Playing max on the difficulty scale, and
still, I'm totally inside their time, you know?

412
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:02,281
Know what that's like? It's like
everything in the world is going slow-motion.

413
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:03,859
Except you.

414
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:07,796
Boring, right?
Can't do nothing about it.

415
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:10,832
You know everything that's gonna happen
before it does.

416
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:14,403
You can't change it.
Just shoot it down when it comes.

417
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:17,769
Bad enough in here.
You should see what it's like at home.

418
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:20,137
Do you know what I'm talking about?

419
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,848
Just once. Just once, I wish
it could be me going slow-motion.

420
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,646
Everything else zipping past.

421
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:39,923
Hey, what are you doing?

422
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,823
Hey, all right.

423
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,399
No way you beat me, though.
I'll wear you down.

424
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:18,194
That was fantastic.

425
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,545
Excuse me.

426
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,523
You wanna see a card trick?

427
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,429
<i>- Uptown A Express. 59th Street next.</i>
- No, really. It's a story.

428
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:28,970
<i>- 59th Street next.</i>
- Move over.

429
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,869
Go ahead, move over.

430
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:34,371
I'm gonna tell you a story...

431
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:36,877
...about Joe and the bartender.
Bartender says:

432
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,039
"You know, business has been slow, Joe.

433
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:42,481
I was wondering if you could get four
buddies to drink at my bar.

434
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:45,087
I'll give you $2."
Joe goes, "I could use money."

435
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:47,986
So Joe goes out. Cut the cards.

436
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,255
Cut the cards.

437
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:53,221
I'll cut them for you. So Joe goes out.

438
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,798
And Joe's gone five. He's gone 10.
He's gone 15.

439
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:59,697
He's gone 20. He's gone 26 minutes.

440
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,395
And he comes back huffing
and puffing and says:

441
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:05,064
"Here's your four guys to drink at your bar."

442
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:06,766
Bartender goes, "There's $2."

443
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,812
They're sitting there talking. Bartender goes,
"These four guys are lonely.

444
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:14,417
Go get four girls to drink with the four guys.
I'll give you $2."

445
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:17,145
Joe goes, "That's easy.
I got lots of girlfriends."

446
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:19,346
So Joe goes out. Cut the cards.

447
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:22,654
Go ahead. That's right.

448
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,557
Okay. I'll do it. So Joe goes out.

449
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:29,392
And Joe's gone five. He's gone 10.
He's gone 15.

450
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:32,001
He's gone 17 minutes
and comes back huffing and puffing.

451
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:35,229
He says, "There's your four girls
to drink with the four guys."

452
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:39,968
Bartender says, "There's $2. It took you
so long to get the girls, the guys left.

453
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:44,205
So do me one last favor. Go get
four more guys, two cases of whiskey...

454
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:47,839
...change for two 20s. I'll give you $2.
Last time I send you out."

455
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:50,714
Joe goes, "Sure, but I don't wanna
go out anymore."

456
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,186
So cut the cards.

457
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:53,948
Go ahead.

458
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:01,828
Okay. I'll cut them again.

459
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,524
So Joe goes out,
and this time, Joe hurries back.

460
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:08,001
He's gone five. He's gone 10.
He's gone 15 minutes.

461
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,662
And he comes back and says:

462
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,106
"There's your four drinking buddies, your
two cases of whiskey and your change."

463
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,041
Bartender goes, "There's $2. Thanks."

464
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,011
They're talking.
Bartender goes, "Are you a family man?"

465
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:21,242
Joe goes, "Sure am. I've got seven kids."

466
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:24,819
Bartender goes, "I got seven kids.
That's great, Joe. How old are you?"

467
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:28,857
"Well, I'm 67. My wife, she says she's 55.
She's really 65."

468
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:31,187
"That's great.
Joe, are you a gambling man?"

469
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:34,331
"I sure am. I play at the 96 Club
on 42nd Street.

470
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:37,331
The other night I won $499.
My partner had a full house.

471
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:40,231
Which usually wins, but I said,
'Not this time, sucker.

472
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:42,998
I got a straight flush."'

473
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:49,742
I have another magic trick for you.

474
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:53,042
Wanna see me make
all the white people disappear?

475
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:56,620
<i>59th Street, Columbus Circle.</i>
<i>125th Street next.</i>

476
00:47:56,787 --> 00:48:00,382
<i>This is the Uptown A Express.</i>

477
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:05,552
<i>Change for the double A local</i>
<i>across the platform. The D.</i>

478
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:08,493
<i>- On upper level, change for Broadway train.</i>
- See?

479
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,497
What'd I tell you?

480
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:19,273
<i>Uptown A. 125th Street next.</i>

481
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:24,509
No, no. We're not late. It says here:

482
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:28,550
"Professor Maxwell,
seminar participants only, wine and cheese."

483
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,688
- Oh, good. I'm starving.
- "Four o'clock." There we are.

484
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,187
Now we just gotta find the...

485
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:37,692
Ed, do you recognize any of this?

486
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:40,323
What do you mean, the architecture?

487
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:42,192
No, no.

488
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,964
The neighborhood, actually.

489
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,998
I don't seem to remember
seeing quite so many...

490
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:51,636
Maybe it's the back way in.

491
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:56,503
I remember there was a gate,
and you could see the library.

492
00:48:56,814 --> 00:49:00,716
- Yeah. I don't see the library, Ed.
- Well, it's behind a wall.

493
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:04,184
I think we're in Harlem, Ed.

494
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:08,580
- That's not where we wanna be.
- No, it isn't.

495
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:11,254
You...

496
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,889
You haven't been paying attention,
have you, after we got out of the subway?

497
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:22,301
Well, I couldn't tell you where
the subway entrance is or how to find it.

498
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:24,236
Is that what you mean?

499
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:26,504
We're lost.

500
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,871
We're lost in Harlem.

501
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:35,649
- I don't think we'll make that reception.
- No, no.

502
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:50,393
Couple of beers, please.

503
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,262
You have Bud?

504
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:02,277
Hi.

505
00:50:03,347 --> 00:50:05,110
How's it going?

506
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:11,885
We're in for the self-actualization
conference.

507
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:14,054
At the university.

508
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,462
You know where the subway is?

509
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,367
Good. He knows.

510
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:29,897
We're from Indiana.

511
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:33,268
That's right next to Illinois.

512
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,537
- Where Chicago is.
- He knows that, Ed.

513
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:40,878
Well, a lot of folks around here don't have
a very clear picture of the Midwest.

514
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:48,687
Can you, like, point in the direction
of the subway?

515
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:57,126
He's right. That's where it is.

516
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:02,432
So, where are you from?

517
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:19,947
I mean...

518
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:26,394
...I didn't want to be like Ernie Banks.

519
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:30,363
I wanted to be Ernie Banks.

520
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,329
Mr. Cub.

521
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:39,771
And it never really dawned on me
that he was black.

522
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:41,433
You know.

523
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,038
Wrist hitter.

524
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:49,910
I was, you know, what? Seven years old.

525
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:54,584
And he was just Ernie Banks.

526
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:56,952
He was my hero.

527
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:00,730
All in the wrists.

528
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:06,360
There weren't any black people in my town.

529
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,664
At least, I don't think there were.

530
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,202
Mr. Cub.

531
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:19,205
It's 8:00?

532
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:22,676
Jeez, will you look at that?

533
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:26,285
This is really something, huh?

534
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:29,017
Wander in here off the street.

535
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,659
I mean...

536
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:38,132
...if people would sit down
and talk like this more often...

537
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,997
Communication.

538
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,365
That's what it's all about.

539
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:52,079
Three blocks south. One block east.
Subway entrance.

540
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:56,548
You want the A train. Downtown.

541
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:00,484
Okay, right. Thanks.

542
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:04,817
Yeah.

543
00:53:06,163 --> 00:53:08,631
That's quite a grip you got there.

544
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,896
Give me five, brother.

545
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,741
Thanks a million, folks!

546
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:36,755
You a popular man today, brother.

547
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:41,626
- There were two others here looking for you.
- Men in black.

548
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:49,370
No, man. White skin, black clothes.

549
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:55,142
And they were stranger than these two.

550
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,636
Motherfucker, hand it over!

551
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:26,572
- I'll cut your fucking face! Put it out here!
- He's retarded, man.

552
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:28,870
- Don't know what you're saying.
- He's holding out.

553
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:31,913
- The money, mister. Give him your money!
- Hurry up, punk!

554
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:33,777
That's for holding out, motherfuck!

555
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,476
- Pick it up, Willis.
- You got blood all over it, Rickey!

556
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:39,781
Man, hustle your butt or I'll cut your ass too!

557
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:45,020
Let me go, mister! Let me go!

558
00:54:57,975 --> 00:55:01,240
There was blood on the floor,
at the bottom of the stairs tonight.

559
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:05,245
I hope one of them poor boys
hangs out there didn't get hurt.

560
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:09,613
They're not poor boys, Mama.
They're junkies.

561
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:14,153
- They bust that light down there again?
- Light was out.

562
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:19,694
If the super doesn't put a lock
on that front door, I'm gonna wring his neck.

563
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,397
Where are you from?

564
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:54,427
Noreen, did a client come in
while I was out?

565
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:57,727
Black man around 30-something,
kind of strange, doesn't talk?

566
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,391
No.

567
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:01,526
No-show?

568
00:56:01,672 --> 00:56:04,505
Third interview
he's crapped out on this week.

569
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:10,277
More power to him
if he can do it without us.

570
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:05,409
The girls and I had our first hit
with this one. Hope you like it.

571
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,646
That's how it is, brother.

572
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,382
Cover charge is $15.
All you got is 5 and some change here.

573
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:20,190
The boss wasn't around, I'd slip you by,
but he's been on my ass all night.

574
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,160
Some other time, all right?

575
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:26,599
Yo, brother!
You forgot your money!

576
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,510
Welcome to Babylon, brother.

577
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:02,286
You've got that faraway look
in your eye.

578
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:06,623
Come out here with things
upon realizing the truth, I think.

579
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:11,260
There's many a peril
out there for you, brother.

580
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:14,259
Don't want to lose your way.

581
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:22,505
Let Virgil guide you, man,
and inform you on the ways of the night.

582
01:03:25,281 --> 01:03:28,216
Children withering away
up here, brother.

583
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:31,520
Worshipping the idol of capital.

584
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:36,082
Lusting after the false salvation
of here and now.

585
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:40,085
Black brother and sister
perishing up here, man.

586
01:03:40,263 --> 01:03:43,323
Waiting for scrap
from oppressor table.

587
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,692
Oppressor got us for a house pet.

588
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,430
Doing tricks to get reward.

589
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:53,337
Oppressor need a slave
and find it here.

590
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,002
Oppressor need a harlot
and find it here.

591
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,510
Oppressor don't need you at all.

592
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:01,172
Why get away from the mob?

593
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,581
You fellows wanna party?

594
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:07,211
- All people on the street at nighttime.
- I'll give you a blowjob...

595
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,085
...if you fix my shoe.

596
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:11,124
Look at what we own.

597
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:12,591
You think you can fix it?

598
01:04:12,762 --> 01:04:17,563
Everything Babylon make,
everything it take in, it shit out here.

599
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:21,397
Hey, listen. Listen, it's a bargain.

600
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:27,237
Hey, mop head, bring your
handsome friend back here.

601
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:35,778
Nighttime is promise, brother.

602
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:38,079
You make deals in the night.

603
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:41,189
Pay all you got for what you can't see.

604
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:45,726
And when sun come up,
illuminate, we been cheated again.

605
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:50,365
All the people desire walking
the streets at nighttime, brother.

606
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,899
All the people feeling.

607
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:57,096
People dream, people fear,
people hatred.

608
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,203
All that eating your heart in the day.

609
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:04,107
All them feeling too dangerous
to show the oppressor...

610
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,239
...come out prowling
for confrontation at nighttime.

611
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,920
We're killing each other
on these streets, brother.

612
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,250
This place not
your home, brother.

613
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:44,852
Virgil don't have to inform you this.

614
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:47,116
Here, brother.

615
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,315
Take the ship back.

616
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:53,428
Just for a night,
take the ship back.

617
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:59,767
Just for a night, take the ship
home to the promised land.

618
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:01,747
You seen this man?

619
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:07,656
Could you say that in English?

620
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:25,808
I think we'll have to speak
with your supervisor.

621
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:40,855
Harriet Tubman made over 30 trips
back South after she escaped that first time.

622
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:44,185
Every time, she was in danger
of being captured...

623
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,296
...and sent back to the people
who had owned her.

624
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:59,669
Men and women who had been slaves
made their way with Harriet's guidance...

625
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:02,206
...through hostile country.

626
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:07,376
Going from station to station
on the Underground Railroad...

627
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,984
...until they reached New York.

628
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:13,254
Now, New York was the promised land.

629
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:15,583
New York was the end of the line.

630
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:22,186
Sometimes, bounty hunters would trap them
up North and kidnap them back into slavery.

631
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,434
Randy Sue Carter?

632
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:42,747
We would like to ask you
some questions.

633
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:46,253
If you're looking for Bobby,
I have no idea where he is.

634
01:10:46,389 --> 01:10:49,916
We have reason to believe
that this man has been living with you.

635
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:53,286
He comes and goes.

636
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:54,861
Right now he's gone.

637
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:56,760
Where does he work?

638
01:10:56,966 --> 01:11:00,197
Here and there. He fixes things.

639
01:11:00,436 --> 01:11:02,199
What do you want with him?

640
01:11:02,672 --> 01:11:04,196
Immigration.

641
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:07,206
Immigration? Give me a break.

642
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:11,210
We had a kid overdose downstairs
last night, and you're pestering people...

643
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,441
...about having some piece of paper
that says they're legal?

644
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:16,245
Will he be coming back tonight?

645
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:19,115
- You wanna know my opinion?
- Just the facts, ma'am.

646
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:22,655
My opinion is that you people
just made up this immigration scam...

647
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:24,851
...just to keep people
under your thumb.

648
01:11:24,994 --> 01:11:27,861
- Is he coming back tonight?
- What am I, his mother?

649
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,056
Wait for him. See if I care.
Just don't do it in my kitchen.

650
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,326
Ma'am?

651
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,765
Have you ever looked at his feet?

652
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,032
What are you, sick?

653
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:09,195
You gonna sit on that all night?

654
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,702
Very funny.

655
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:15,433
Look, can I get you another drink?

656
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:21,916
I don't care, but the boss
has been on my ass all night.

657
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,379
Good. I'll get you another one.

658
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:06,223
Thank you. Thank you.

659
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:09,658
Thank you.

660
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,131
Thank you.

661
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:19,102
Listen, I'm gonna sit here for a minute,
but don't get any ideas, all right?

662
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:22,540
The man that owns this club has been
on my ass since I opened here...

663
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,703
...and I'm trying to keep him off of it.

664
01:13:24,847 --> 01:13:29,341
So if he comes by, you are my gentleman
friend from Philadelphia. Okay?

665
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:32,146
What's your name, honey?

666
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:37,556
You can't talk?

667
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:41,458
Some alibi you're gonna be!
You can hear, can't you?

668
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:52,465
You like my singing?

669
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,771
Oh, well. My voice isn't what it used to be
when I was with the girls...

670
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:58,880
...but it's got character.

671
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:02,848
There you are, precious.
How's my girl tonight?

672
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:09,353
Mr. Price, this is Louis.
Louis is from Philadelphia.

673
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:11,550
Pleased to meet you, Louis.

674
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:13,986
Louis doesn't talk.

675
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:18,033
Oh, is that so? Well, that's awful.

676
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:22,896
That's just terrible.
Must leave you out of the conversation.

677
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,830
Hey, look here, precious.

678
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,442
What I found digging through the office.

679
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,741
Must have been taken 15 years ago.

680
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:36,618
Oh, look at this, Louis.
This is me and the girls.

681
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:38,549
We were just kids.

682
01:14:39,121 --> 01:14:42,784
You were flying high in them days.

683
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:45,791
Must have felt like it would last forever.

684
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:49,187
I remember when you were
working the Apollo.

685
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:51,833
I had to stand in line to get a ticket.

686
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:53,559
That'll happen.

687
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:58,573
Standing out in the rain a whole hour
just to see my favorite singer.

688
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:03,075
And now here you are working my club.

689
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,571
Here I am.

690
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:13,051
You know, it's funny how when one
is shooting up, the other is tumbling down.

691
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:16,851
- Must be a law of nature.
- That's real funny.

692
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:21,453
But there's always some point when the one
shooting up and the one tumbling down...

693
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:22,791
...is on the same level.

694
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:25,929
Even if it's just for one little second.

695
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:35,304
I was wondering...

696
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:38,607
...after your last set tonight...

697
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:41,443
...maybe you and I could...?
- Oh, Mr. Price, I'm so sorry.

698
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,847
Louis and I have made other plans.

699
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:48,683
Well...

700
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:53,591
That's just too bad, isn't it?

701
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:58,533
Nice talking to you, Louis.

702
01:16:03,505 --> 01:16:05,473
Flying high...

703
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:07,332
...in them days.

704
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:16,748
I will never tumble down that low.

705
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:21,252
Another drink.

706
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,125
Thank you.

707
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:38,867
Now, do you really like my singing?

708
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:41,974
Really?

709
01:16:43,846 --> 01:16:48,283
As long as I have been wearing these
things, I still haven't gotten used to them.

710
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,181
Likely to go blind,
flapping them around in bed.

711
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:54,918
I'll only be a second, honey.

712
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:59,159
You haven't gone to sleep
on me, now, have you?

713
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,488
Look, make a noise if you're
still awake, okay?

714
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:13,470
I have been out with some guys
who were quiet, but this really takes it.

715
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:16,276
You know, I don't do this a lot.

716
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:21,212
People think because you're on tour, you're
always sleeping around, but it's not true.

717
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,950
Well, most tours it's not.

718
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:28,590
When we were young and foolish
and still singing in bowling alleys...

719
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:34,226
Of course, that all changed
when I hooked up with Rodney.

720
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,326
Boy, you know, I hardly even think
about Rodney anymore.

721
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:43,232
But as bad as things got,
I sure missed the girls.

722
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:47,574
Well, you didn't waste any time
getting comfortable, did you?

723
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:52,678
Well, here I am. Still interested?

724
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:06,617
How come I like you so much?

725
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,891
You could be anybody.

726
01:18:32,187 --> 01:18:33,677
Louis.

727
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:36,484
Hey, try and stay with me, okay?

728
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:40,424
I mean, let's forget about that woman
that you saw on-stage.

729
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:45,096
It's just you and me. Okay?

730
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,272
I'm flying at 4, so I've got to be
to Kennedy by 3:00.

731
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,643
I remember when Rodney
decided to go on the road with me.

732
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:37,911
As long as he didn't have to carry
my bags, he said.

733
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:41,887
He wouldn't even let me carry them.
Sometimes, we'd wait for half an hour...

734
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:43,548
...for the porter to come.

735
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:46,454
Rodney was like that, though.

736
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:48,892
Real proud about the little things.

737
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,025
I don't know when I'm gonna
be back in New York...

738
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,931
...because I don't have any bookings
after Atlanta.

739
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:01,666
You were great in bed last night.

740
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:06,342
But you're gonna have to do something
about them toenails.

741
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,751
- How about a little help?
- Come on. Put it in the hoop, man.

742
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:17,221
Come on, brother. Come on.

743
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,128
Come on, shoot it up. Come on!

744
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:28,661
All right!

745
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:31,897
Funny-looking motherfucker,
but he can shoot.

746
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,147
So what? He looked at you.

747
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:43,682
Nobody looked at me. He doesn't
know anything about what we been doing.

748
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,281
Did you see him go inside?

749
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:50,550
- No.
- All right, man. Look, let's go. Come on.

750
01:21:57,326 --> 01:22:01,092
So how long you been up here, pal?

751
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:05,591
I mean, you a native, or what?

752
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:11,903
It's my first day in this precinct.

753
01:22:13,242 --> 01:22:16,473
My partner upstairs has been
handing me all kind of horror stories.

754
01:22:16,912 --> 01:22:19,881
Like how they're gonna cook
me and eat me alive up here...

755
01:22:20,015 --> 01:22:22,108
...if I don't look out what I'm doing.

756
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,018
Can't be all that bad, I figure.

757
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,415
It's pretty damn nice to me, Harlem.

758
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:35,226
I mean, you know,
people are people, right?

759
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:39,424
I mean, you put on a uniform, it's not like
you hand in your status as a human being.

760
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:42,933
I mean, we're here to protect
and serve, right?

761
01:22:43,272 --> 01:22:46,435
Like it says on the L.A. Cruisers
on <i>Adam-12.</i>

762
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,611
They never should have
taken that show off the air.

763
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:58,076
So, what do you think?

764
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:11,397
Yeah, well, take it easy, pal.

765
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:09,115
Is Sam Prescott in?

766
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,320
Are you clients of his?

767
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:19,331
- We're looking for this man.
- Ever see him?

768
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:24,004
Are you gentlemen with an agency?

769
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:25,230
- FBI.
- Immigration.

770
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,304
We're working together on this one.

771
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:31,344
I see. Okay.

772
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,811
This is an interagency
request-for-information form.

773
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:38,749
Complete this and take it to the Applications
receptionist. Line 7 in the central office.

774
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,287
I'm going to need documentation
for you both. Birth certificate...

775
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:45,858
...alien naturalization papers,
draft registration, military ID...

776
01:24:46,027 --> 01:24:49,827
...military discharge papers. I'll need
a letter from your departments...

777
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:54,128
...on official stationery verifying employment
and something with a picture on it.

778
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:55,531
No student IDs allowed.

779
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:58,935
This is form 107G.
Fill this out and have it notarized...

780
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:02,270
- We'll come back later.
- When Mr. Prescott is in.

781
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:08,375
And I'll need social security
numbers on both of you.

782
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:49,314
I'm sorry, you just can't stay.

783
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:54,754
If it was just me, it would be different, but I
have Little Earl and Mama to think about.

784
01:25:54,896 --> 01:25:56,591
I have got to take care of them.

785
01:25:56,765 --> 01:25:59,563
I mean, those guys,
they just gave me the creeps.

786
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:03,226
Is there anything that you need?
Clothes or money or anything?

787
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,531
Well, I hope you understand.

788
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:11,201
But whatever it is you're messed up in,
I can't take the chance.

789
01:26:11,746 --> 01:26:13,270
It's been nice knowing you.

790
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:49,259
- Hey, man, what's happening?
- Hey, man, how you doing?

791
01:28:58,213 --> 01:28:59,578
All right.

792
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:24,718
Great deal. Casios, $40.

793
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:28,590
My low overhead
ensures you great savings.

794
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:34,167
Casio 45s, $40. Forty dollars.
Great deal, sir.

795
01:31:34,335 --> 01:31:39,864
Great deal. Forty dollars.
Anyone can be a musician.

796
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:46,503
Just try it. It's a great gift.
Step right up. Play your Casio.

797
01:31:55,123 --> 01:31:58,889
So I say to him, "Barry, I wouldn't call
what we have a relationship."

798
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:02,552
He says, "What would you call it?"
I said, "We're seeing each other."

799
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:06,427
He says, "To me, that's a relationship."
I said, "Call it what you want.

800
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:09,833
To me, we're just seeing each other."
I can't believe this guy.

801
01:32:10,004 --> 01:32:14,168
I've gone out with him five times,
and he wants a relationship. Why?

802
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:17,072
I can't believe it.
I don't wanna get that serious.

803
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:21,272
I mean, I someday wanna get married
and have babies. But five times?

804
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:24,748
He's cute and everything. I mean,
I knew he was interested in me.

805
01:32:24,919 --> 01:32:27,479
Believe me, I knew
he was interested in me.

806
01:32:27,655 --> 01:32:31,682
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?

807
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,454
You can't go in if you don't
have an appointment.

808
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:37,598
Do you have something
to deliver to Mr. Vance?

809
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:40,996
Look, go downstairs,
have them call up...

810
01:32:41,169 --> 01:32:45,538
...and we'll get you a floor pass,
and we'll start from scratch, okay?

811
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:57,208
Number one, he's short.

812
01:32:57,385 --> 01:33:00,286
He can't help that,
but I can't help the way I feel.

813
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:05,449
You know what else? He wears those
shirts with the epaulets on the shoulders.

814
01:33:08,129 --> 01:33:10,529
Hey, brother. What's happening?

815
01:33:20,108 --> 01:33:23,908
I know how the man feels. My bladder
ain't worth beans these days.

816
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:37,285
I heard Bobby's old lady threw him out
on account of them guys looking for him.

817
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:39,392
I wonder how he's making out.

818
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,155
Oh, the flesh is weak,
but the spirit finds a way.

819
01:33:43,331 --> 01:33:47,267
- What was that, man?
- I'm open, Dell, hit me.

820
01:33:47,735 --> 01:33:50,568
- Hit me.
- Flea-flicker.

821
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:54,967
- Buttonhook at 10.
- Look at them hands.

822
01:33:55,143 --> 01:33:56,633
Z-out and fly.

823
01:33:56,945 --> 01:33:58,242
Bump and run.

824
01:33:59,013 --> 01:34:00,310
Come on.

825
01:34:00,848 --> 01:34:03,408
- Let a man drink in peace, will you?
- Buttonhook.

826
01:34:04,585 --> 01:34:06,177
The bomb.

827
01:34:13,261 --> 01:34:14,728
Where is he?

828
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:51,186
Now, Smokey.

829
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,033
You know, I don't know
if I like him in bed or not.

830
01:36:10,211 --> 01:36:12,475
The sex is okay, it's not great.

831
01:36:12,647 --> 01:36:16,208
He has fabulous hands.
He's from New Hampshire, though.

832
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,376
I always thought I'd meet
the kind of guy...

833
01:37:22,683 --> 01:37:24,048
Who are you?

834
01:37:25,419 --> 01:37:27,148
How did you get in?

835
01:37:50,144 --> 01:37:51,577
Who sent you?

836
01:37:53,648 --> 01:37:55,240
Gregory send you?

837
01:38:16,537 --> 01:38:18,767
Do you want some of this, is that what?

838
01:38:20,241 --> 01:38:23,608
Here. Take all you want.

839
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:41,985
Look, whoever is paying you for this
isn't paying you what I could.

840
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:48,994
I've got an organization here. We're
diversifying. Moving in every direction.

841
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:54,507
This is nothing.

842
01:38:56,344 --> 01:38:59,404
It solves some cash-flow problems...

843
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,414
...solves some problems on the books.

844
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:11,115
You tell me who sent you,
and I'll cut you in.

845
01:39:12,793 --> 01:39:16,422
That's what you want, isn't it?
A piece of the action?

846
01:39:17,298 --> 01:39:19,960
It's stupid to go for just one score.

847
01:39:24,171 --> 01:39:27,766
Oh, I knew it was a mistake
getting involved with you people.

848
01:39:27,942 --> 01:39:32,345
You don't see the big picture.
You just don't see...

849
01:40:24,932 --> 01:40:26,627
What are you?

850
01:40:31,706 --> 01:40:36,643
Look, whoever you are, we can still talk.

851
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:38,909
There's still time.

852
01:40:57,398 --> 01:40:59,559
I own real estate.

853
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,047
Three-toe.
