1
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,577
It was like I was watching myself.

2
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,871
And I told the kids to get in the car,
told them to wait.

3
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,797
It was march 9th, 1977,
in dansville, Michigan.

4
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,731
What's happening?

5
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,428
What the hell is going on?

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,726
Hey!

7
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,229
- Hey, there!
- There's kids in there.

8
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,898
- Is there people in there?
- Please, don't!

9
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,157
My boy is in there!
I think my boy's in there!

10
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,596
Where's Fran?

11
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,143
Mrs. Hughes, my name is aryon greydanus.

12
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,773
The court has appointed me
to be your attorney.

13
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,362
It's sort of ironic.
I used to work in a prosecutor's office.

14
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,241
A few months ago,
i would have been prosecuting this case.

15
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,624
Mrs. Hughes, I've been told
that you committed murder.

16
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,793
Is that correct?

17
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,967
I've been told
that you confessed to committing murder.

18
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,635
Is that correct?

19
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,392
If the information
i have been given is accurate,

20
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,520
this will be an extremely difficult case
to defend.

21
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,399
It will be impossible if you won't help me.

22
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,819
Please answer me, Mrs. Hughes.

23
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,155
Yes.

24
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,618
Yes? Yes what? Yes, you did kill him?

25
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,333
Mrs. Hughes?

26
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,008
Last night I dreamed that he...

27
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,553
He was here.

28
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,098
He came into the jail,
and keys were dangling.

29
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,103
He came into my cell,
and sat down, and said,

30
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,106
"everything will be all right. I'm sorry."

31
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,238
I loved him.

32
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,533
I did.

33
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,471
Who's that guy over there?

34
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,266
- Who?
- The one smoking.

35
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,977
That's Mickey Hughes. He's older.

36
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,147
Isn't he cute'?

37
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,233
He's really wild, too, I think.

38
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,485
Let's get something to drink.

39
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,738
- Come on.
- Francine!

40
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,925
You're one of the Hughes boys.
I heard about you.

41
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,638
What did you hear?

42
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,101
Why aren't you dancing?

43
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,439
Ain't found anybody I want to dance with.

44
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,073
Want one?

45
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,158
No.

46
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,036
What's the matter,
you afraid it'll stunt your growth?

47
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,747
I'm not afraid of anything.

48
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,712
- Am I gonna see you Friday?
- Maybe.

49
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,290
Faster! Faster, Mickey!

50
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,336
Hey! Okay! All right!

51
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,711
Okay!

52
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,757
Don't.

53
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,186
Don't, Mickey.

54
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,770
What's the matter?

55
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,313
Come on,
you've got nothing to be afraid of.

56
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,817
I know what I'm doing.

57
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,028
You wouldn't believe what happens
at the night shift at the nursing home.

58
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,196
Mickey.

59
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,573
They got these two nurses, and...

60
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,826
Hey! Come on, you guys, knock it off.

61
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,875
I just love it when you say my name.

62
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,711
You'd try to convince me of anything.

63
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,964
Yeah, I could, if you'd just close your eyes.

64
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,894
Mickey, don't! Don't.

65
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,485
You can hear what's going on
in the backseat, can't you?

66
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,114
I want to do it right,
not in the front seat of a car.

67
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,240
I want to wait until I get married.

68
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,952
Right. Okay, so let's get married.

69
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,121
- When?
- Right away.

70
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,830
What's the hurry?

71
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,126
I can't believe you!

72
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,464
Dinner's ready.

73
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,383
Why don't you two come on in
and sit down?

74
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,265
You sit right here.

75
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,476
Thank you.

76
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,564
Mickey says your folks
are mountain people, too.

77
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,734
- I guess you've got some manners.
- I hope so, ma'am.

78
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,949
Well, I wasn't no older than you
when Berlin and I got married.

79
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,872
Well, I guess I've got something to say
about that, right, Mickey?

80
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,833
Would you cut the roast, daddy?

81
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:50,043
Francine, I really can't believe
you don't want to see him anymore.

82
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,094
Don't be so hard on him.
Why don't you take him back?

83
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,556
- Because I need some time to see if...
- Why?

84
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,475
He just... I don't know.

85
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,645
He won't leave me alone.
He's always talking about getting married.

86
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,606
- What's that color?
- Pinkissimo.

87
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,233
I like it.

88
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,070
He said I'll destroy him
if I make him wait any longer.

89
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,239
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

90
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,328
He really loves you.

91
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,205
Francine, come in here and help me, hon.

92
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,749
Just a minute.

93
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,252
- He does, doesn't he?
- Yeah.

94
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,590
He's sitting home alone,
listening to records and crying.

95
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,009
That's love.

96
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,679
Yeah, it's real...

97
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,430
I don't know. I think I should finish school,
maybe get a job, just get out of here.

98
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,569
You're everything to me.

99
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,907
Nobody ever said that to me before.

100
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,828
Well, I never said that to anybody.

101
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,332
I told him over and over
that I wanted to wait,

102
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,043
but he wouldn't take no for an answer.

103
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,757
I didn't know what to think.
I mean, nobody ever loved me like that.

104
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,053
It was real powerful.

105
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,767
I'm such a lucky guy.

106
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:30,143
Marry me, Fran. Marry me. Make me happy.
Make yourself happy.

107
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,400
I want to.

108
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,944
I don't know anymore.

109
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,156
It's such a beautiful night.

110
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,037
Big girls don't cry

111
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,914
hey.

112
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,749
Big girls don't cry

113
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,880
do I look any different?

114
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,257
No. Why?

115
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,052
Look at me. Look in my eyes.
What do you see?

116
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,262
Same thing I see every day, pupils.

117
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,557
- L'm serious.
- So am I.

118
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,435
- What are you talking about?
- Want a donut?

119
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,855
I'm taking a donut.

120
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,985
- Am I walking any different?
- No.

121
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,905
Come on, I give up. What's the big deal?

122
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,115
I did it.

123
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,658
You what?

124
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,829
My god, Francine, that is a big deal.

125
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,998
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

126
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,044
Think anybody will be able to tell
by looking?

127
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,882
- Don't look.
- No.

128
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,467
I hope not.

129
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,427
I hope I'm not pregnant.

130
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,055
He didn't have any...

131
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,932
My god.

132
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,102
Well, did you like it?

133
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,939
I don't know.

134
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,232
Where were you?

135
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,027
- Where else?
- Yeah.

136
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,411
- I guess you'll marry him, huh?
- I guess.

137
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,706
That one's $93.

138
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,669
Ma, I'm gonna need a little help.

139
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,630
How much help?

140
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,760
$93 worth of help.

141
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,849
You can buy it on time if you have credit.
You just make monthly payments.

142
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,726
I'll make good on it.

143
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,899
Hell, you ain't gonna get married
every day, now, are you?

144
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,567
Not on your life.

145
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,948
Well, when I was a young man
and never been kissed

146
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:48,036
I got to thinkin' it over
how much I had missed

147
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,164
so I got me a girl
and I kissed her and then, and then

148
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,125
oh, lordy, well, I kissed her again

149
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,463
because she had kisses sweeter than wine

150
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:03,759
she had kisses sweeter than wine

151
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,264
kisses sweeter than wine

152
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,642
well, I asked her to marry
and be my sweet wife

153
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,480
- you like being married?
- I like it a lot.

154
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,817
We're home, newlyweds!

155
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,863
Come on, my zipper!

156
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,157
I can't wait till we get a place of our own.

157
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,408
- I want some soda pop.
- Me too.

158
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,286
I'll get it.

159
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,456
Fran, would you help out?

160
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,667
Of course. Stop it!

161
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,546
Can't wait, huh?

162
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,089
Lover boy.

163
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,304
You'd best be looking for a steady job now.

164
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,473
I'm working on it.

165
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,228
We'd been married about a year,

166
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,481
but we were still living
with Mickey's parents.

167
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:04,065
I was trying to fit in the best I could.
We were hoping Mickey would find a job.

168
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,072
Now, here's Mickey when he was six.

169
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,370
Quiet little thing.
Never used to make a bit of fuss.

170
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
Sure hope he likes this.

171
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,335
- I think you look real pretty.
- Thanks.

172
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,884
Thought you pulled the head on this thing.

173
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,138
- Did you get a job?
- No.

174
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,598
Weren't for bad luck...

175
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,516
Yeah, you got it.

176
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,603
Awful early in the day
to quit looking, isn't it?

177
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,198
What do you think?

178
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,991
- Got a beer?
- Me, too.

179
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,203
Well, what do you think?

180
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,914
Where'd you get that?

181
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,749
Kmart, on sale for a dollar.

182
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,209
Take it off.

183
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,879
- Mickey.
- Take it off. Get me a beer.

184
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,131
I'll get it.

185
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,591
Get it yourself.

186
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,675
Hey!

187
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,428
Well, that's different, ain't it?
That's real sassy.

188
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,097
Make a fool out of me,
sassing me in front of my family!

189
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,683
You're crazy!

190
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,227
Hey, let me in!

191
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,231
Promise you'll be good.

192
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,359
Don't you ever lock
no door on me, ever! Ever!

193
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,278
- Give me that!
- Don't!

194
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,407
You know how to behave!

195
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,381
Fran, come on.

196
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,968
Look...

197
00:16:55,765 --> 00:17:00,060
It's just that you look so good
in those things. They're too sexy.

198
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,729
I only wanted to look good for you.

199
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,357
Yeah, I know.

200
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,236
It wasn't so wrong to look pretty
before we were married.

201
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,740
- Why is it now?
-Lt's not. It's not.

202
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,911
Look, it's just that I love you so much,

203
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,748
I can't stand to think
of you dressing up for anybody else.

204
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,960
Mick, I'm sorry.

205
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,435
This came for you.

206
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,070
Mrs. Hughes, we're just wasting our time.

207
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,738
If you can't learn to trust me,

208
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,741
then perhaps you would be better served
by another attorney.

209
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,120
I've been turned down on a plea bargain.
You've been denied bail.

210
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,207
I don't have a clue
of how to plead this case.

211
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,756
What do I have to do or say
to convince you to defend yourself?

212
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,721
You like it in here? Do you?

213
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,058
Well, fine.

214
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,186
Do you know what this is?

215
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,482
This is a letter from a woman who has
been beaten by her husband for years.

216
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,528
She read about what you did,
about what was happening to you,

217
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,322
and she realized that
she had to leave her husband.

218
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,742
Mrs. Hughes, you are not alone.

219
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,475
I always wanted to have
a house in the country,

220
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,395
the kids, you know, the whole thing.

221
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,566
Mickey and me, we dreamed about it.
It was fun.

222
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:17,448
When he was working,
he'd always buy me something nice.

223
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,282
Something real nice.

224
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,327
How do you like my girl?

225
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,330
That's a beautiful scarf.
You buy that for her, Mickey?

226
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,415
You bet.

227
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,960
That's a fine woman, indeed.
You're a lucky man.

228
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,550
Anyway, when I got up
to the top of that building,

229
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,427
there was this observatory.

230
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,514
I looked up,
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky,

231
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:47,098
just the full moon,
as naked as me the day I was born.

232
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,398
Don't tell me that! I saw!
You were looking at him!

233
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,817
Knock it off, won't you?

234
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,529
What's going on?

235
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,202
So I left.

236
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,206
Berlin took me
to my mama's place in Jackson.

237
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm gonna get a job.
I was thinking maybe they needed...

238
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,810
Help me with this root, will you?
I can't seem to get it all out.

239
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,105
I was thinking maybe they needed
somebody down at the donut shop.

240
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,857
I'd like to try to finish school.

241
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,026
You always was good with gardening.

242
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,321
Mama, I don't want to go back.

243
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,449
Bless me, I had to sell
your old bed, Francine.

244
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,368
I want to stay here for a while.

245
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,496
Lots of women, they have
to put up with their men.

246
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,873
Especially if there's children.

247
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,209
And mostly the men don't mean it.

248
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,212
Hand me that can over there,
will you, honey?

249
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,927
If you make a hard bed,
you have to lay in it.

250
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,765
Have you been sick in the mornings yet?

251
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,893
It ain't fair.

252
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,770
Now, you know that
Mickey's gonna be coming by.

253
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,440
- He's already called you...
- I don't want to talk to him!

254
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,027
It's his baby, too.

255
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,862
I know he's jealous, but that's only natural.

256
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,033
It's your duty to stand by him.

257
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,829
Francine, he loves you.

258
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,043
It's not really so bad, is it?

259
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,755
No, it ain't so bad.

260
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,551
Here.

261
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,644
My daughter!

262
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,606
Christy Marie.

263
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,609
He was so proud when Christy was born.

264
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,697
When she was six months old,
we moved into our own place.

265
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,075
It wasn't the greatest, but I was real happy.

266
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,717
Would you get
the baby seat out first, honey?

267
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,390
Got our own place finally.

268
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,975
I love you.

269
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,979
You know where I want to plant
the garden? Right in the front.

270
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,608
You are my sunshine

271
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,278
my only sunshine

272
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,449
the new job, it's gonna work out just fine.

273
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,869
The baby's so big.

274
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,622
- How old is she now?
- Six months.

275
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,207
Can you believe that?

276
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,710
Did my mother ever feel
that way about me?

277
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,047
I love her so much, and so does Mickey.

278
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,298
Get up.

279
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,343
Hey, you girls, come on in.
We're gonna play some records.

280
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,553
I'm glad you're here.

281
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,930
You guys ready for some more beers?

282
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,808
Everybody is.
We want some more food, honey.

283
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,188
- Ernie wants five hamburgers.
- Make it three.

284
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,316
Hey, when did you do this?

285
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,819
Yesterday.

286
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,028
Where?

287
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,948
Hey, Mick, will you change the record?

288
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,241
In town.

289
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,867
Why?

290
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,496
I just took Christy into town, Mickey.
We get lonely out here.

291
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,251
I told you not to go in town without me.

292
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,483
So what do you think?

293
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,860
- Not bad.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

294
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,780
You okay?

295
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,242
I don't know how you can put up with it.

296
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,953
Things have been really good
since Christy was born.

297
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,831
He's just a little ragged
since he lost his job.

298
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,751
I'm sorry, Francine,
but that don't make it right.

299
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,378
It was just as much my fault.

300
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,172
We're a family now.
I've got to try to be a good wife.

301
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,176
I've got to figure out
what he wants and what he's thinking.

302
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,971
Just wait. He'll be in here
apologizing any minute.

303
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
You gonna let him?

304
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,520
It's not easy for him, too, you know.

305
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,439
It's hard being
a good husband and a good father.

306
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,192
He's doing the best he can.

307
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
Stop looking at me. I'm all right.

308
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,657
Really.

309
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,539
Everybody's gone.

310
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,173
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

311
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,051
Fran,

312
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,054
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,265
Don't talk about it, okay?

314
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,649
I don't know
how you put up with me sometimes.

315
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,152
Can't control myself.

316
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,035
I don't really deserve you.

317
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,958
No?

318
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,047
I don't?

319
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,719
"Yes. Yes, you do, Mickey. You deserve me.

320
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,305
"Of course you do, Mickey. Don't say that."

321
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,778
My only sunshine

322
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,573
you make me happy

323
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,325
when skies are gray

324
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,660
- excuse me.
- Louder. Sing louder.

325
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,997
You'll never know, dear

326
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,081
<i>louder .</i>

327
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,499
How much I love you

328
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,833
play!

329
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:30,376
Please don't take my sunshine away

330
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,763
I told you to shut up.
You have a big mouth, Fran.

331
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,431
Leave me alone!

332
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
- Shut up!
- You're sick!

333
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,436
Don't!

334
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,397
Don't!

335
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,692
No, don't!

336
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,111
I hate you!

337
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,946
"No! <i>'</i>

338
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,743
bitch!

339
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,476
Fran, come here.

340
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,604
I don't want to.

341
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,195
- Come in here. I want to talk to you.
- No.

342
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,744
I want to tell you I'm sorry.

343
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,768
I love you.

344
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,523
Why'd you do it? Why?

345
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,167
Don't cry.

346
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,838
Please.

347
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,645
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hughes,
but we don't make the rules.

348
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,898
The head of the household
must apply for welfare.

349
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,568
Now, why didn't your husband
come with you?

350
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,445
He just...

351
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,905
I guess he's too proud.

352
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,991
My kids are hungry.

353
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,997
The problem is, you can't get welfare
unless you separate from your husband.

354
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,583
Now, all you have to do
is sign the proper papers.

355
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,128
I could give you a food order right now
if I had those papers.

356
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,630
- And all I do is sign?
- That's all.

357
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,840
Honey.

358
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,140
My husband said he'd kill me if I left him.

359
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,435
The courts would protect you.

360
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,192
- Where are the papers?
- They're right here.

361
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,154
Now I want you to read before you sign,

362
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,823
and then you just pay the filing fee,
and the papers are served.

363
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,783
The fee'? How much?

364
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,660
$7, Mrs. Hughes.

365
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,832
$7? You think I'd be here if I had $7?
I don't have it.

366
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,835
I see.

367
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,214
Well...

368
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,472
I can't pay you back.

369
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,560
You'll want to read this very carefully,

370
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,438
and in six months,
you'll go to court for the final decree.

371
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,485
- This is the divorce paper?
- Yeah.

372
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,822
You can be divorced just like that?

373
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,449
Just like that.

374
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,415
"Charlotte and Sally were inside the house.

375
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,791
"They were laughing.

376
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,003
"When Willie reached
the edge of the forest,

377
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,466
"he lay down on a mound
of cool, green moss.

378
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,181
"The moon sat like a big saucer in the sky.

379
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,184
"He looked up and..."
What do you think happened?

380
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,312
- A bear got him.
- A bear.

381
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,480
No, they couldn't see him anymore
because night had fallen.

382
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:07,486
"And when they looked out in the morning,
he was gone." Where'd he go?

383
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,583
Okay, get in the back seat. Come on.
You be good. Play a game.

384
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,710
I'm proud of you, honey.
It's a real good thing you're doing.

385
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,254
I'm kind of afraid to let go.

386
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,632
Stop it! Stop it!

387
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,384
- Come on, be nice.
- I said it first!

388
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:30,221
I packed so fast,
i don't even know if I got everything.

389
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,806
You'll be all right, Francine.

390
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,599
- I said it.
- You're gonna be fine.

391
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,352
Let's sing a song, okay?

392
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,104
- You are my sunshine?
- Yes.

393
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,479
You are my sunshine

394
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,856
this is that stupid song!

395
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,192
My only sunshine

396
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,111
you make me happy

397
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,655
when skies are gray

398
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,074
you'll never know, dear

399
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,869
how much I love you

400
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:57,248
please don't take my sunshine away

401
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,208
you are my sunshine

402
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,668
my only sunshine

403
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,961
you make me happy...

404
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,051
Would you keep them on the porch?

405
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,012
You're going to have a baby sister.
What's a good name?

406
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,388
- Shelly.
- Shelly?

407
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,849
- Hey, there.
- Look who's here.

408
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,185
- How you doing?
- Hi there, honey.

409
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,980
I'm happy you're here.

410
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,733
- My, you're getting big.
- Yeah. Come on in.

411
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,236
Hey! How you doing, Christy?

412
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,945
- Guess what?
- What?

413
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,282
- L'm pregnant again, too, myself.
- No kidding?

414
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,326
Don't show yet. Just two months.

415
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,870
- How's Ernest and the baby?
- Fine.

416
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,456
- You stay on the porch.
- Hey, Jimmy.

417
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,672
I don't believe this.
Look at all these names!

418
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,175
My gosh.

419
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,177
There I am. "Gaby and Ernest."

420
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,595
I know.

421
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,555
There's Vic and Lois.

422
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,350
There's the twins, Terry and Tommy.

423
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,646
My gosh, where are all these people?

424
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,526
Seems like another world, don't it?

425
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,404
Yeah.

426
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,074
I heard the divorce is going through.

427
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,993
I didn't know what else to do.

428
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,830
I thought he'd be by, but he hasn't.
I heard he has another girl.

429
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,958
You're just down, Fran.

430
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,961
You did your best.

431
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,965
Mickey has that real bad temper.
He always did.

432
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,675
But he loves me.

433
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,930
Maybe this'll be the best one yet.

434
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,139
Yeah.

435
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,317
Francine?

436
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,029
I seen her.

437
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,326
Berlin was just saying he can't tell
which one of you she looks more like.

438
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,124
Well, you look fine, Francine.

439
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,668
She was a pretty easy birth.

440
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,420
What you calling her?

441
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,507
I don't know. Maybe Nicole.

442
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,801
From the soap opera, remember?

443
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,553
Them was good days.

444
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,181
Ain't you gonna ask about Mickey?

445
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,561
Well, he's just fine.
He's got himself all straightened out.

446
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,104
He's working.

447
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,859
Now, when are you two
gonna get back together

448
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,320
and be a family like you ought to?

449
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,238
We're divorced.

450
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,492
You just had his child, Francine.
That ain't no divorce.

451
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,704
Your children need their father.

452
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,457
I did it for the children.

453
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,167
He's changed now.

454
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,254
Don't you love him no more, Francine?

455
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,011
Woman's got to take
the bitter with the sweet, you know.

456
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,890
Mickey loves you, Francine,
something awful.

457
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,934
He wants to see his children.

458
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,981
I'm afraid.

459
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,775
He won't hurt you, honey.

460
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,735
Now, he stayed away 'cause you wanted it,

461
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,072
but it's wrong
to keep a father from his own children.

462
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,369
This ain't no use talking to her.

463
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,288
Yes, it is.

464
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,874
She heard me.

465
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,151
Looking great.

466
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,321
- Care if I come in?
- Yeah.

467
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,162
You do all this yourself?

468
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,790
You run a great household.

469
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,336
- That your chicken?
- Yeah.

470
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,672
I've been missing your cooking.

471
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,216
Missing you.

472
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,599
You working?

473
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,644
I'm all straightened out.

474
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,898
- You want to see the baby?
- Yeah.

475
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,818
Look at that.

476
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,279
Looks like Christy, huh?

477
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,115
Hey, here's your papa.

478
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,161
Gaby will be bringing
the kids home any minute.

479
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,663
I can't wait around to see them, though.

480
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,667
Hey, Fran, I want us to get back together.

481
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,837
We're divorced, Mickey.

482
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,757
A thousand divorces can't change anything.
You're mine.

483
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,177
I don't want to go back.

484
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,554
I don't want it the way it was.

485
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
Hey!

486
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,770
Nobody knows me like you do.

487
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,022
Go on, tell me you ain't missed me.

488
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,777
Yeah, I missed you.

489
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,574
It'll be a lot better this time.

490
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,785
I promise.

491
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,631
It's over.

492
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,008
You know, I can come and go
as much as I want.

493
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,885
Just leave, Mickey.

494
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,267
Christy, don't run. Christy.

495
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,525
Grandma!

496
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,738
I knowed you'd come!

497
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,240
He's hurt real bad, Francine.

498
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,491
He went through a stop light
and got hit by a telephone truck.

499
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,659
Oh, no.

500
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,620
They're flying a surgeon in from Chicago.
Some kind of specialist.

501
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,790
- He don't want me nor no one.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

502
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,583
He just keeps calling for you.

503
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,793
How bad is he?

504
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,170
He's real bad.
The doc says he may not make it.

505
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,589
-L've got to go to the bathroom bad!
<i>-L'll</i> take him. I'll take him.

506
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,549
Come on. Let's go, boy.

507
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,970
He's all busted up inside.

508
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,492
I come to spare you.
You go get you some sleep.

509
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,036
Rest of 'em is in the waiting room.

510
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,996
He still doesn't know me, wimpy.

511
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,580
It's a wonder he knows anything at all.
He was awful close to death.

512
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,838
Doctor says it's a miracle.

513
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,674
I got to hand it to you, Francine.

514
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,886
We sure didn't think much
of you divorcing Mick,

515
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,055
but you're okay in a pinch.

516
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,515
We're glad you're back.

517
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,809
Thanks.

518
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,396
I'm gonna stay a little while longer.

519
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,952
I thought,
"my god, he's never gonna make it."

520
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:18,166
When I took his hand, he started to cry.
I did, too.

521
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,583
I stood there thinking how awful it was.
Nobody deserved this.

522
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,767
What?

523
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,934
Yeah.

524
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,520
That's real good.

525
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,070
No, my bed isn't too hard.

526
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,158
What's the matter, honey?

527
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,077
I can't hear you.

528
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,417
I'm hugging you too over the phone.

529
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,671
I hope I see you soon, too.

530
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,008
I love you.

531
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,514
Gaby kept telling me not to go back.

532
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,933
But I felt I owed it to Mickey
to help nurse him.

533
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,977
So when flossie said
the place next door was empty,

534
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,604
I decided to move in.

535
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,150
You want to talk to my mom?

536
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,277
I decided
if I'm going to help Mickey get better,

537
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,446
I might as well be close by.

538
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,114
- I owe him that.
- Mom, it's for you.

539
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,740
You owe him nothing.

540
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,494
Hello, I'm busy. I'll have to call you back.

541
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,497
You didn't see him in the hospital.
He nearly died.

542
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,831
I wish he had.

543
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,335
My gosh, that was a terrible thing to say.

544
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,711
I'm sure glad Ernest didn't hear me.

545
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,296
Be careful.

546
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,882
You know, Francine,

547
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:54,178
sometimes I think that's the only way
you're going to get rid of him.

548
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,268
We're divorced, Gaby.

549
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,645
Anyway, he's gonna live over there
with flossie.

550
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,690
Soon as he's better, I'm on my way.

551
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,233
You're really fooling yourself, Francine.

552
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,068
Thanks for helping me get settled.

553
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,655
Against my betterjudgment.

554
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,664
They're here!
Mommy, mommy, they're here!

555
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,589
Daddy! I missed you!

556
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:35,173
The kids were so happy to see Mickey
when he came home from the hospital.

557
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,345
Fran.

558
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,682
The doctors weren't sure
whether he'd ever be the same.

559
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,145
Wait, is Fran coming?

560
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:47,106
You'll feel better
as soon as we get your dressing changed.

561
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,984
I thought, "how could I leave?

562
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:54,155
"What would the kids think
if I walked away and left their father?"

563
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,037
Fran!

564
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,707
Fran, come here!

565
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,585
Hey, Fran!

566
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,424
Mom, daddy says he wants you,
and he wants you now.

567
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,551
I know. I can hear him.

568
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,011
Come on, Fran! Come here!

569
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,187
Mickey wants you to change his dressing.

570
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,523
He can change it himself.
Doctor said he's got to learn.

571
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,692
Do it for me, Fran.

572
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,490
Don't seem like anybody
can do anything right for him but you.

573
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,993
Look at him. He's been home over a month,
and he's still lying around.

574
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,162
The doctor said
he should be up trying to walk.

575
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,955
How's he going to get better
if you keep babying him?

576
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,041
This is my house. I don't think
you ought to take that tone with me.

577
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,337
I'm sorry. I'm tired.

578
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:55,674
I've got three babies at home
to take care of, and him over here...

579
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,843
He won't do anything for himself.

580
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,596
I'm going home. I'm going to stay.
I can't take it any longer.

581
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,806
Hey!

582
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,314
You can't stay.

583
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,318
How about a nice welcome?

584
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,403
Daddy!

585
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,280
You ain't staying, Mickey.

586
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,948
Well, who's gonna stop me?

587
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,326
- We're divorced. The welfare.
- Come on.

588
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,536
Hey, come on, Fran.

589
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,874
It's time I came home.

590
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,502
Things are getting out of line here.

591
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,844
- Any more'?
- No.

592
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,930
Put 'em down.
You want to help me fold 'em?

593
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,849
L'm hungry-

594
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,644
I'll have supper ready in a little while.

595
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,814
That's not what I'm hungry for.

596
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,691
Mickey.

597
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,401
-L'm all better now.
- The kids.

598
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,156
Let's get married again.

599
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,825
- No, it wouldn't work.
- Sure, it would.

600
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:07,496
You're mine, Fran.
A thousand divorces can't take that away.

601
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,123
No, Mickey.

602
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,667
Hey, you think I'm not man enough for you?

603
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,419
I think you're gonna be just fine.

604
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,962
I'm fine now.

605
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,176
It don't work no more, Mickey.

606
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,597
- Stop that! Stop it!
- Don't do it!

607
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,182
- Go get grandma!
- Nobody's gonna help you now!

608
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,935
Grandma!

609
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,479
Don't!

610
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,648
Don't hurt me! Stop!

611
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,650
Don't! Don't!

612
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,486
No!

613
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,495
Who'd want to be married to you, anyway?

614
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,041
Boy, you got a problem.

615
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,460
- Get out of my way.
- Come here!

616
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,016
Fran? Where are you?

617
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,527
We got him calmed down, ma'am.

618
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,447
Says he's not going to bother you anymore.

619
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,160
You're not going to take him away?

620
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,829
Sorry, ma'am,
but we didn't see him do anything,

621
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,583
so we're not allowed to make an arrest.

622
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,545
Well, you can go to the prosecutor's office
in the morning

623
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,671
and swear out a complaint.

624
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,716
Complaint?

625
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,183
Would you like me
to take you to the hospital?

626
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,392
No.

627
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,663
Got a little drunk.

628
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,879
Guess I'm not all well yet.

629
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,177
Frannie, I'm humbling myself.

630
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,640
Sorry. I won't do that no more.

631
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,861
Don't ever hit me again in front of my kids,
or anyone.

632
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,446
Your kids?

633
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,659
I'll leave you. I'll take the kids and go.

634
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
You ain't going no place.

635
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,708
Get that idea right out of your head.

636
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,295
Wherever you went, I'd find you.
Then you know what would happen?

637
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:30,175
Yeah, you're gonna stay right here,

638
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:38,391
or those kids ain't gonna have no mother.
Understand?

639
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,602
Yes.

640
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,452
Francine, in all my research,
i haven't found a single precedent

641
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,580
that would support a plea of self-defense,

642
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,790
so this is what I recommend.

643
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,461
Forget self-defense,
and we change the plea

644
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,547
to not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity.

645
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,966
You mean crazy?

646
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,679
No, I mean, if I can get expert testimony

647
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,931
as to your state of mind
at the time of the murder,

648
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,808
we may have a chance.

649
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,978
Now, you'll have to see
a number of psychiatrists.

650
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,147
Are you willing to do that?

651
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:30,319
The next couple of years were
just about the best we had.

652
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:35,365
Mickey calmed down a little,
even let me apply to college.

653
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,911
And the kids getting older
made everything easier.

654
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,623
Let me have that Crescent wrench.

655
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,002
- One wrench.
- Thanks.

656
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,927
I need that ball-peen hammer.

657
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,807
- Here's the hammer, daddy.
- Thanks.

658
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,479
- Where'd you guys go yesterday?
- The store.

659
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,232
- What did you get?
- We needed some milk and bread.

660
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,159
Where's that hammer? I need the hammer.

661
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,079
- It's right there.
- Daddy!

662
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,665
Well...

663
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,168
- Daddy, you're all dirty.
- So?

664
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,337
You're making me all dirty.

665
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,048
- I love your mom.
- I love my mom, too.

666
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,052
Come on.

667
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,846
- Oh, no!
- Come on.

668
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,265
I'll teach you.

669
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:49,106
- Expecting something?
- No.

670
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:52,234
Mickey Hughes, Mickey Hughes.

671
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,487
Francine Hughes.

672
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:02,411
- Thought you weren't expecting anything.
-L'm not.

673
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,207
"This is to confirm that you..."

674
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:11,253
It's a check! From the government!
I got the Grant!

675
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,340
They'll give me money
to go to business school.

676
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,094
You're not going to school.

677
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,806
If I get a degree, I could get a job.

678
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,601
I could just go in the mornings,

679
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:29,355
and I'd be home
by the time the kids got back.

680
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,023
I could still take care of the house.

681
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,028
If I don't go, we don't get the money.

682
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:44,031
In the beginning, I was afraid
to even open my mouth in class.

683
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:48,665
But little by little, I felt better.

684
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,045
I liked to pretend
the other part of my life didn't even exist.

685
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,972
One of each, please.

686
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,224
Thank you.

687
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,517
No, thank you.

688
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,478
I swear, Fran, you hardly eat anything.

689
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,607
Just because you eat enough for both of us.

690
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,984
You want to go shopping after class?
We're going to the mall.

691
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,986
I can't. My husband needs the car.

692
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,154
Hiya, Henry.

693
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,656
- You remember Henry.
- Yeah. Hi, Henry.

694
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,159
Henry here protects our school,
don't you, Henry?

695
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,327
Hi.

696
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,083
- Henry eckworth.
- Hi. Francine Hughes.

697
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,961
Pleased to meet you.

698
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:40,466
Mickey started complaining more and more
about me going to school.

699
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:44,054
I was afraid he was going to try
to make me stop.

700
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,891
He got drunk one night
and started in on me and the kids,

701
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,226
so I packed the kids in the car.

702
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,123
You looking for this?

703
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,666
Every time I'd try to run away,
he'd catch me,

704
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,043
and things would get worse.

705
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,545
Mickey, stop it!

706
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,672
Hey!

707
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,021
Stop!

708
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,149
Stop!

709
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:26,656
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

710
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,621
Get your hands off him!

711
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,580
- Get off that boy!
- Stay back!

712
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,917
You're hurting him!

713
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,126
Get off him!

714
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,045
Get back!

715
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,382
Get your hands off him, I tell you!

716
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,761
Get off him! Get off him!

717
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,513
- Stop!
- Leave him alone!

718
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,306
Leave that boy alone!

719
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,647
It's been going on too long now.

720
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,024
Something awful's gonna happen.

721
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,156
You're family.

722
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,659
You've got to help us.

723
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,498
She's right.

724
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,463
It ain't Mickey's fault,
nor Francine's, either.

725
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:27,217
He just ain't right.

726
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,928
Never has been right since that crash.

727
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,847
I ain't gonna sit here and listen to this talk.

728
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,684
It's true, Berlin.
I knowed it that night in the hospital,

729
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,769
the minute he pushed my hand away.

730
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,980
It's for Mickey, too.

731
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,191
He's got to be sent someplace
where he can get some help.

732
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,275
And the children.

733
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,030
There's no son of mine
is going to no mental ward.

734
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,034
Not whilst I'm alive to stop it.

735
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,952
Sit down, Berlin. I know what's right.

736
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,997
I think you're all being
awfully hard on Mickey.

737
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,624
-L'm leaving.
- You ain't.

738
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,167
You watch me.

739
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:14,093
Berlin stayed away for three weeks.
Flossie just crumbled.

740
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:19,019
She took to her bed
and stayed there until he came back.

741
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,272
We never discussed
committing Mickey again.

742
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,649
I knew I was totally on my own now.

743
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,361
- So, how can I help you, Mrs. Hughes?
- Last night, my...

744
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,822
My ex-husband tried to kill me.

745
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,657
He hit a police officer.

746
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,118
Come on, let's go. Could we go, please?

747
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,078
I see by the records he's on probation.

748
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,914
Have you been in touch
with his probation officer, Mrs. Hughes?

749
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,541
No, sir.

750
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,878
Well, don't worry. Since he's on probation,
he'll automatically...

751
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,547
- I want to go see daddy.
-...Be picked up.

752
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,925
Put it back.

753
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,593
Come here. Come over here. Move over.

754
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,887
- Mom!
- When?

755
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,347
I can't say when.

756
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,101
As I've said, he's violated
his probation by assaulting a police officer.

757
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,435
He'll serve time for that.

758
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,689
Could I fill out a complaint?
You know, for attempted murder?

759
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,858
I'm afraid he's going to kill me.

760
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,568
I don't know what else to do.

761
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,612
I'm going to have to let probation handle it.

762
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,573
But come back to see us
if there's any more trouble.

763
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,661
Let's go.

764
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,289
- My name is Francine Hughes.
- Stop it.

765
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:23,416
I'm at a pay phone in Lansing with my kids.

766
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,543
- Stop it.
- Stop it!

767
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,046
I don't have any money.

768
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,547
Stop it. Mom, could you take her?

769
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,050
My ex-husband
who's on probation beat me up.

770
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,137
He threatened to kill me.
I need some protection.

771
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,679
I'm sorry. Stop it!

772
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,182
I'm sorry. I need some protection.

773
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,101
When?

774
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,769
Take her. Take her.

775
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,896
Mom!

776
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,485
Well, he's home right now.
I'm afraid to even go there.

777
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,321
- Pick it up.
- I want to go home!

778
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,199
I want to go home! I don't want to!

779
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,034
I want to go home!

780
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,119
- A couple of days?
- I want to go home!

781
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,288
- Stop it!
-L'm working on this. No!

782
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,457
- Stop it!
- I want to go home!

783
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,012
Mom, we need help.

784
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,891
- Good night.
- Good night.

785
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,478
- Love you.
- I love you.

786
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,276
Everything's gonna be all right.

787
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,611
- Good night.
- Good night.

788
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,154
Sweet dreams.

789
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,448
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

790
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,242
- Love you.
- Love you.

791
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,417
Let me in! I just want my kids!

792
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,548
Give me my kids!
I'll break this door in your face!

793
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,761
He's here right now.

794
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,639
- Could you please send some help?
- I want those kids! Let me in!

795
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,808
The police are on their way.
Get away from here!

796
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,810
What'll they do?

797
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,356
- Let me in!
- No!

798
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,525
I just want my kids!

799
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,320
Maybe just for now
you ought to let him have the kids.

800
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,613
He'd never hurt 'em.

801
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,407
Give me those kids,
or I'll break this door on your face!

802
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,950
It'll calm him down.

803
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,287
Please, Francine,
i can't take any more. I just can't.

804
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,872
Oh, god.

805
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,917
Flossie will be real good to 'em, honey.

806
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,252
And you can get 'em back later.

807
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,550
Come on, kids, let's go.

808
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,961
Francine, want something to eat, honey?

809
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,630
I can't. I have to get going.

810
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,174
I've got to get some help
before my money runs out.

811
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,635
Got to do something about Mickey.

812
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,888
It was wrong to let him take the kids.

813
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,348
We had no choice.

814
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,475
I've got to get some gas
before I go to Lansing.

815
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,809
Wish me luck.

816
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,520
I sure do, honey.

817
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,039
You could get my kids back.

818
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:54,127
You could keep my husband
from doing anything he pleases to me.

819
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,630
That's a police matter, Mrs. Hughes.
Maybe you should hire a lawyer,

820
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,674
and sue your husband
for the custody of your children.

821
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,342
Custody? They're my children!

822
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:06,180
I think something has to be done now
before he gets drunk and kills me.

823
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,683
Lots of women leave the state
just to get away.

824
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,184
I can't do that.

825
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:14,522
I don't have a car. I don't have any money.
I can't leave my children!

826
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,652
I'm getting aid to dependent children,

827
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,155
and he's not supposed
to be living with me, but he won't get out.

828
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,657
That's breaking the law, isn't it?

829
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,035
Yes, but the only thing
that this department can do

830
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,995
is take your welfare away.

831
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,581
And where would
your children be without that?

832
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,875
I don't have my kids. He has my kids.

833
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,044
All I want is my kids back.

834
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,507
I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do for you.

835
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,887
Why don't you throw away
all his clothes and lock the door?

836
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,014
Or you could get a peace bond
and keep him away.

837
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,309
- And then, if he beats you...
- After he beats me. After.

838
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,144
I know how you feel,

839
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:57,686
but you see, Mrs. Hughes, if we take action,
the only one we can prosecute is you.

840
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,276
You don't know how I feel.

841
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,665
I'm not coming, Mickey.
I don't care what you promise.

842
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,089
Fine. Go ahead.

843
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,010
I'm not gonna do it.

844
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,560
Okay, send the kids over to your mother,

845
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,812
-go in the bathroom, and lock the door.
- He really sounded...

846
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,274
- What?
- He really sounded sorry.

847
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,027
Don't call me anymore!

848
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,947
Hi, honey.

849
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,824
How are you?

850
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,785
No, I love you, too.

851
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,500
Okay, it's time for you to go to bed.

852
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,918
I love you.

853
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:00,962
Bye.

854
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,976
It's almost time for church, honey.

855
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:18,187
Just a second, mama.
I've just got to finish this.

856
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,495
- Mommy!
- Come here!

857
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,330
- Mommy!
- Mom!

858
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,665
Oh, god!

859
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,502
- How are you doing?
- Good.

860
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:45,173
Hi, Fran. The kids wanted to see you.

861
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,007
Don't worry. We won't stay long.

862
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,512
It's okay.

863
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,768
Want some coffee?
We're just getting ready to go to church.

864
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,980
Well, we won't keep you.

865
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,734
- Fran, I want to talk to you.
- Come on, kids.

866
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,861
Come here, partner.

867
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,029
Okay.

868
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,742
Really, you don't have to come back.
I'm not even going to ask you.

869
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,536
I just want to tell you

870
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,956
I quit drinking.

871
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,000
And I'm going to church.

872
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,504
I did all those things to you
because of the drinking.

873
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,965
It'll never happen again.

874
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,719
That's real fine, Mickey.
I made up my mind I'm not coming back.

875
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,184
The kids miss you something awful.

876
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:42,188
Children need a mother and a father both.

877
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,734
Soon as I get a job and I get settled,
I'm going to come get the kids.

878
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,736
Fran, I love those kids.
I'll never give them up.

879
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:53,320
Give them up? I'm their mother.
If I have to, Mickey, I'll get a lawyer.

880
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,994
Mom, you should have seen the breakfast
i made for everyone.

881
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,912
And I took the laundry
down to the laundromat.

882
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,456
Such a good girl.

883
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:03,125
Lot of responsibility for a little child.

884
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,004
I'm real sorry you won't be coming with us.

885
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,381
I guess you've made up your mind.

886
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,759
You've got your reasons,
but it's a crying shame,

887
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,928
'cause he's doing his best.

888
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,724
Come on, kids, let's get in the car.

889
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,061
I miss you.

890
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,565
- Bye, mom!
- I love you, mom.

891
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,815
I love you.

892
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,986
Please, Fran. It'll be different this time.

893
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,280
I love you.

894
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,324
I want you with me and the kids.

895
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,036
I'll never take another drink.

896
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,956
If I do, you can leave.

897
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,250
Bye, morn!

898
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,344
Bye, mommy! Don't miss me!

899
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,678
Goodbye!

900
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,270
You will also hear the testimony

901
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:50,149
of Christy Hughes
and her brother James Hughes.

902
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,527
They will tell you
that they observed the fight.

903
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,529
They will also tell you that the fight ended,

904
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,491
that James Berlin Hughes
went to bed in the bedroom,

905
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,161
and that somewhere
between a half an hour

906
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,164
and two hours after he went to bed,

907
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,334
Francine Hughes told them
to put on their coats,

908
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,836
that as they were going to the car,

909
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,297
they both saw a gas can
sitting on the back porch,

910
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,342
which they had not seen earlier that day.

911
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:20,012
Shortly thereafter,
Francine Hughes came out of the house,

912
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,848
got into the car, and started to drive away.

913
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,811
After all the evidence
has been presented to you,

914
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,981
we will ask that you find
the defendant guilty as charged.

915
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,316
Guilty of premeditated murder.

916
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:37,567
Now I'm going to ask you to put yourself
in the place of Francine Hughes,

917
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,991
and when she tells you
about what she experienced,

918
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,953
about the inhuman situation
she found herself in,

919
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:48,040
try your hardest
to put yourself in her place,

920
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:52,582
to see all the circumstances
from her point of view.

921
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,589
Francine Hughes
is not a cold-blooded killer.

922
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,803
When you hear the history
of Francine Hughes,

923
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,305
when you hear her human situation,

924
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,978
you will enter a verdict
of not guilty at the conclusion of this case.

925
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:16,148
Now, you indicated that Mickey Hughes
made repeated threats to kill Francine.

926
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:20,490
He said specifically,
as I recall your testifying,

927
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,576
that it was "all over for her"?

928
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,330
My question is this, officer,
why didn't you take him away?

929
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:32,251
Because he made the same threats to me,
and they didn't seem like...

930
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,586
They were just words.

931
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,837
I see.

932
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,007
On what did you base this conclusion?

933
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,469
That he had an opportunity
while he was threatening me

934
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,722
to back it up, but he didn't.

935
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:50,853
Do you put yourself
in the same position, sir,

936
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,648
with your uniform and gun?
I assume you were wearing your gun.

937
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,860
Yeah, that's right. I had a gun.

938
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:01,072
Are you equating
your situation with Francine's?

939
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,824
Wasn't it quite obvious to you

940
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,119
that he wasn't going to be doing anything
while you were still there?

941
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,704
I didn't assume that, no.

942
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:12,750
Mrs. Hughes, do you see the person known
to you as Francine Hughes

943
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,961
in the courtroom here today?

944
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,423
Yes, sir, I do.

945
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,636
Mrs. Hughes, she was married
to one of your sons?

946
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,847
Yes, sir.

947
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,684
Which son was that?

948
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,148
My son James.

949
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,318
We called him Mickey.

950
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,076
I'm sorry.

951
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,331
I'm all right. I'm fine.

952
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,377
Around the time of march 9th, 1977,

953
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,589
how would you say
Mickey and Francine were getting along?

954
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,467
I thought everything was
just as good with them as anybody else.

955
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,677
I knew they had a few problems.

956
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,055
You know, like anybody,
they had disagreements

957
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:12,639
or maybe financial problems or stuff,
but nothing unusual,

958
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,020
nothing that bothered me or concerned me.

959
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,982
Was there ever an occasion, Mrs. Hughes,

960
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,610
when you saw your son
strike Francine Hughes?

961
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,364
Never.

962
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:29,827
Never have I ever seen
any of my sons strike one of their wives.

963
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,250
Mrs. Hughes, do you recall
the children ever telling you

964
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,586
about their father
beating up on their mother?

965
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,049
Well, the children came over
a couple of times,

966
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,261
and they would say,
"my mommy and daddy is fighting."

967
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:51,432
I see. They wouldn't say,
"my daddy is beating up on my mom."

968
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,979
I suppose they have said that.

969
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:02,317
On August 12th of 1972,

970
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,572
at approximately 14 minutes after 7:00,

971
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,325
do you recall a situation
where the police came to your house

972
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,327
because your son
had repeatedly hit you in the face?

973
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,829
I most certainly do not!

974
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,706
I don't know where
you're getting your information from.

975
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,250
- Okay.
- I most certainly do not!

976
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,710
Mrs. Hughes,

977
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:24,840
do you recall when you called
the lngham county sheriff's department,

978
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,177
and on that occasion,
Francine Hughes hid in your house?

979
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,640
Hid in my house?
Well, she had hid in our house sometimes.

980
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:35,643
She done that
even before they got married.

981
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,438
I didn't know whether they was fighting
or playing games or what.

982
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,401
And who was she hiding from?
Her children?

983
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,030
Well, I don't know.

984
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,992
Maybe she was hiding from him.

985
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:56,080
Afterwards, she'd say,
"mom, it's more my fault than it is his."

986
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,750
Mrs. Hughes, don't you
remember the police coming to your house

987
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,794
when Francine was hiding from Mickey

988
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:05,965
because, among other things,
he had been beating on her?

989
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,259
I do not recall no such an occasion.

990
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:12,596
Do you recall telling the policemen that
Mickey Hughes had hit you repeatedly?

991
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,224
- No, sir.
- Do you recall him breaking down the door

992
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,768
to try to get into your house
to get after her?

993
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,020
He didn't break down no door. He did not!

994
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,605
Mrs. Hughes, I'm merely asking you.

995
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:25,108
Well, you just better ask something else,
'cause he didn't break down my doors.

996
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,945
- You sure got you some good information.
- Excuse me.

997
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,947
You better go back and get you some more.

998
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:36,825
Now, Christy, what was he saying
to your mother during this evening?

999
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,998
You mean, you want to know
what kinds of things he said?

1000
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,877
I want to know what he said, yes.

1001
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,460
Well, he called her a whore, and he...

1002
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,342
Tell me.

1003
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:54,884
I'm sorry you have to say this, Christy,
but you tell us what he said to her.

1004
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,267
He called her a bitch and a whore.

1005
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:03,731
Did your mom seem depressed
or happy or normal or what?

1006
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:04,815
Depressed.

1007
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,735
Now, Christy, is this the first time

1008
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,363
that you remember
that your father beat up on your mother?

1009
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,490
No.

1010
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,450
- Was it the second time?
- No.

1011
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,453
- Was it the third time?
- No.

1012
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,998
- How about the fourth or fifth time?
- No.

1013
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,001
How many times
did your father beat up on your mother?

1014
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,045
Too many to count.

1015
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,924
Do you remember your father
grabbing your mother by the arms,

1016
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,510
bending them up behind her back?

1017
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,387
Do you remember
showing the policeman that?

1018
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,847
Yes.

1019
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,433
Christy, do you remember telling them

1020
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,269
that your dad hit her in the face
and hit her in the head?

1021
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:43,979
Yes.

1022
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,066
- Like this?
- I don't know.

1023
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,278
Usually with the back of his hand,
or his fist, or the front of his hand.

1024
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,697
- Just any old way, right?
- Right.

1025
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,326
Did your mother ever try to get away,

1026
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,829
get away with you and the children,
the other children?

1027
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,289
- Many times.
- Many times?

1028
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,790
And do you remember where you went?

1029
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,127
Usually to grandma Hazel moran
in Jackson. Her house.

1030
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:11,669
And what would happen on those
occasions that you would go to Jackson?

1031
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:15,344
He would come and threaten to, like, bust
down the door and break things if she...

1032
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:18,597
What did he say he would do
if she tried to leave?

1033
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,643
He would kill her.

1034
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:27,522
He said that if she left with you,
he would kill her?

1035
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,607
Yes.

1036
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,651
How many times did he tell her that?

1037
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,239
Two or three. I don't know.

1038
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,408
Christy,

1039
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,496
how do you feel
about your father being gone?

1040
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,001
You miss your father?

1041
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,089
No.

1042
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,802
Are you glad that he's gone?

1043
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,388
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1044
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,599
That is all I have, your honor.

1045
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,145
The defense calls Francine Hughes.

1046
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,948
- Why didn't you leave?
- At first I didn't because...

1047
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,828
Feeling the way I did about him being,
you know, such a young man

1048
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,749
and not being able to work or anything,

1049
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:32,170
what more could I take away from him?

1050
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,339
Could I take the kids and leave?

1051
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,466
And I knew if I did, he'd find me.

1052
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:41,009
March 9th, 1977 wasn't
the first time he threatened to kill you.

1053
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,139
Did you believe those threats?

1054
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:46,602
When he first started making them, I didn't,

1055
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:51,185
but when he started chasing me

1056
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:55,444
and trying to run me off the road
and stuff like that,

1057
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,071
I believed him.

1058
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:03,990
In the last year, I had come to believe
that sooner or later he would.

1059
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,165
I was afraid.

1060
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,377
Very afraid.

1061
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:16,961
And it was like
he just wanted to possess me.

1062
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,388
Francine, you've said that your children are

1063
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:27,017
the most important thing
in the world to you.

1064
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,270
In that context, I'd like to ask you

1065
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,689
if you remember an incident
which occurred some time ago.

1066
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,524
Yes.

1067
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,985
Could you tell us what happened?

1068
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,487
The kids kept begging for a puppy,
and some people we knew gave us one.

1069
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,619
The kids called her lady.

1070
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,288
It was real cold
when we brought her home,

1071
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,790
but Mickey wouldn't let her in.

1072
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,294
So our neighbor gave us
an old, raggedy doghouse,

1073
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,296
and we fixed it up behind the garage

1074
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,257
and put straw in it
to keep the puppy warm.

1075
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:06,307
Did there come a time
when the dog was going to have puppies?

1076
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:13,272
Yes, she was going to have puppies
before she was a year old.

1077
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,858
When she got ready to have them,
she was acting really sick,

1078
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,027
and they wouldn't come out.

1079
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:24,946
We asked Mickey if we could take her
to the veterinarian, but he wouldn't let us.

1080
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,662
The kids were crying,
and they were running in and out,

1081
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,582
crying, "another one came out. It's dead."

1082
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,671
They begged Mickey to let us
bring her inside because it was cold out,

1083
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,966
but he wouldn't, so we tried to sneak her
in on the back porch.

1084
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:47,305
He found out, and he put her out.
She was bleeding.

1085
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,102
What happened to the dog?

1086
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:58,396
When I went out later, she was dead.

1087
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:01,653
She was lying on the ground.

1088
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:06,950
When the kids came out, they said,
"mama, she's frozen."

1089
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:14,124
So the dog froze to death
after giving birth to those puppies?

1090
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,918
Yes.

1091
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,840
Now, Francine,

1092
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:29,556
we're going to march 9th, 1977.

1093
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,269
Could you tell me
how that day started out?

1094
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,108
Like any other day.

1095
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,778
I got up at 5:30
and started to get ready to go to school.

1096
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,489
When I got to school, I felt really good.

1097
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,076
By the time I got home, I was kind of tired.

1098
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,954
You're late!

1099
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:55,082
Five minutes.
Had to give a girl a ride home.

1100
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,501
And now you're going
to give her a ride every day?

1101
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,712
No, she has a regular ride.
I won't do it again.

1102
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:09,387
And I need your help.
Save me! Save me! Please!

1103
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,555
I'll save you.

1104
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,893
- What did you get this for?
-'Cause we were all out.

1105
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:18,271
What's for dinner?
There's no meat in here. There's nothing!

1106
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,649
I got some TV dinners.

1107
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,860
You know I don't like them.

1108
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,448
I didn't think
you were gonna eat here anyway.

1109
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,826
That's the trouble with you.
You're always thinking.

1110
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,501
I don't even want to
smell that stuff cooking.

1111
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,802
Come on, go outside! Go on!

1112
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:08,030
That's another trouble. School!

1113
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:11,908
You're not gonna go there anymore!

1114
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:25,297
I'm not gonna quit.

1115
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,112
Let me just feed the kids,

1116
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,781
and then I'll fix you something else later.

1117
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,410
No. No. No.

1118
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:58,997
No school.

1119
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,878
I'm not gonna quit school.

1120
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:10,092
I can fix you so you'll never go back.

1121
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,969
Go ahead, then!

1122
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,220
Don't!

1123
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:19,768
Yeah?

1124
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:07,273
Leave me alone!

1125
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,630
I was just thinking,

1126
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,509
maybe I should just say,
"I'm going to quit school,"

1127
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:19,304
get him quieted down,
and then figure out later how to go back.

1128
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,973
But I couldn't.

1129
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,395
Something rose up in me and said no.

1130
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,776
"If you say it,
Mickey will win just like he always has,

1131
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,736
"and you'll never go back to school again."

1132
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,825
I went back inside,
and Mickey started punching me.

1133
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,078
And Christy went
over to flossie's to call the police.

1134
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:49,334
Was he hitting you
when the police pulled up, Francine?

1135
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,460
No.

1136
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:55,549
When he realized they were gonna come,
he went into the living room and sat down.

1137
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,303
And what happened
after the policemen left?

1138
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:02,305
I had the kids wash,
and we sat down to eat.

1139
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:08,061
I remember my lip was stinging
with the salt where he had hit me.

1140
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:14,609
We were trying to be quiet,
and he was sitting in the living room.

1141
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:19,239
And then he came into
the kitchen to get a beer.

1142
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,665
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1143
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,001
Get down!

1144
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,963
That's right. That's right! That's right!

1145
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:23,011
What about school?
What about the school, school, school?

1146
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:29,100
No. No. I won't go.

1147
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,102
No.

1148
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:43,323
You went up to the bedroom
to clear Mickey's dinner dishes.

1149
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,826
He was there. What happened?

1150
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,834
He said, "how about a little?"

1151
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,628
What did that mean?

1152
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,090
He wanted to have sex.

1153
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:04,803
Why didn't you just say no?

1154
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:09,891
I knew if I refused, he'd start again.

1155
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,395
I didn't want to go through it.

1156
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:19,772
The kids were hungry.
They were crying and stuff.

1157
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:27,863
And I was worried about them, so I did.

1158
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:32,414
How did it make you feel?

1159
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,586
That I might vomit.

1160
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:44,338
I hated it worse than I ever hated it before.

1161
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:52,475
Because

1162
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,440
he was drunk, it took a long time.

1163
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:07,486
After he went to sleep, I got dressed,

1164
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:13,204
and I told the kids they could come out.

1165
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:18,543
What was going
through your mind, Francine?

1166
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:26,922
It's hard to describe how I felt.

1167
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,138
I was thinking that...

1168
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:36,394
Well, I was thinking about all the things
that had happened to me.

1169
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:40,773
How much he hurt me my whole life.

1170
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,656
And I thought about school.

1171
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,785
All that work for nothing.

1172
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,540
Whatever I did,
Mickey would knock it down.

1173
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:04,672
And then I thought about my kids,

1174
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:10,591
and how their lives were
as terrible as mine.

1175
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:20,434
I thought, "take 'em away. Just leave.

1176
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,526
"And when Mickey wakes up,
you and the kids will be gone.

1177
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,412
"When Mickey wakes up,
you and the kids will be gone."

1178
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,624
Sorry.

1179
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:44,688
What's happening?

1180
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,233
What's going on? The house is burning!

1181
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:55,449
Okay, Francine, let's go through this again.

1182
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:58,328
You waited till Mickey fell asleep,
is that right?

1183
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,788
- Right?
- Yes.

1184
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,375
Then you took the kids
out to the car, right?

1185
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:08,917
You got the gasoline out of the garage,
and you came back into the house, right?

1186
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,423
Then you poured the gasoline
around the bed,

1187
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:15,136
and then you lit a match
and ran to the car, right?

1188
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,722
- Right?
- Yes.

1189
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,433
Okay, the kids were in the car,
and they were scared and crying,

1190
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:22,685
and you started driving away.

1191
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:25,938
Francine, what were you doing?
Where were you going?

1192
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:29,609
I ran for my life. I ran for the life of my kids.

1193
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:35,694
Francine, did you premeditate and plan
the death of your husband, Mickey Hughes?

1194
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,199
No.

1195
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,703
The defense rests.

1196
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,120
The jury's in.

1197
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,165
You're wanted downstairs.

1198
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,682
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, your honor.

1199
