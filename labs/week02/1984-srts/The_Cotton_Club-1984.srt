Synched by Fingersmaster.
Enjoy!

1
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,960
She told you that?

2
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:47,074
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I think you're right.

3
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,774
Hey. How you doin'?

4
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,243
How do you like this?

5
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,718
- He's not bad for a white kid.
- Hey boss.

6
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,673
How much music can you take?

7
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,139
- I want to fall in love!
- You got a tin ear!

8
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:38,550
I want to listen to him. He's good.

9
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,176
- You got everything you need?
- We got it all, Mr. Flint.

10
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,679
He's in the Bamville.
You can't miss him.

11
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,699
We won't miss him.

12
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Blow that bughouse bastard
to kingdom come!

13
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,846
That kid can play. I'm tellin' you.

14
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,600
Hey, girls, would you like
to join us over there!

15
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
What?

16
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,959
Come to a table with nice people.

17
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,408
Come on over
and say hello to Dutch!

18
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,034
Bumpy is here, too.

19
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:57,203
Stop breaking my heart!

20
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:01,708
Come over here! Nice trumpet.
I thought you were black.

21
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:07,130
There's four guys, we all strike out,
am I right? - He's cute.

22
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,342
That trumpet duel was great,
but you beat him bad.

23
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,512
You ought to be put in jail.
He puts riffs in from King Oliver!

24
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,766
I once lost a grand
on a horse named Gideon's Trumpet.

25
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,976
- Your name Gideon?
- No.

26
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:24,689
- Abbadabba, this man's a musician.
- Hey, girls!

27
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:26,933
Forget it! They cold.

28
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,209
What are you sittin' all alone for?

29
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,121
Come here.
Give me a chance to dazzle you!

30
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,298
- Take your breath away.
- I knew it! Come on!

31
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,208
Look at this!

32
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,837
The kid's got the Midas touch
with the broads!

33
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,998
- Park her right here.
- What am I going to sit on?

34
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,198
No. Don't ask that question.

35
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:44,751
Don't sit on the best part
of your personality, kiddo.

36
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,667
- What a rude man!
- Let me guess your names.

37
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,939
Alright. Veronica? Alice?

38
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,442
- Am I right?
- Forget it.

39
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,050
I'm not close?
I got a head for figures.

40
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,250
Well, what's your name?

41
00:06:56,354 --> 00:07:00,183
- Would you believe Myrtle?
- You're named Myrtle?

42
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:03,395
- What's your name?
- Forget it! Vera.

43
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,864
Cicero. Like in Latin.
Did you ever study Latin?

44
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,559
I was an altar boy.

45
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,406
- He was an altar boy!
- It figures. - I believe him.

46
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,783
- It's a lovely tie.
- Thank you.

47
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:23,665
You going with anybody? - Do you see
a ring? - Why are they here?

48
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:30,714
The little men in blue.
You wanted by the police, Miss Cicero?

49
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,553
- We're very good tonight, fellas.
- Watch out!

50
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,478
You bastard!

51
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:49,149
Solly, go after them!

52
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:51,151
You bastard!

53
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,072
- What the hell is this?
- Some people don't like me.

54
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,033
Who are you anyway?

55
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:00,827
I'm your Dutch uncle from now on.

56
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,122
I owe you one. Dutch Schultz owes you.

57
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,374
- Abbadabba, you alright?
- Yeah.

58
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,210
I'm in heaven!

59
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:12,047
- Get up!
- Pow!

60
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,674
Do they do that here every night?

61
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm very swoozled.

62
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,190
- Help me!
- Which room is your room?

63
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,737
I'm a little kaflooie, you know?

64
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:38,782
Should I put you in bed, too.

65
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,793
Oh no!

66
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,338
Pull your arm out!

67
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,258
See, that wasn't very hard.

68
00:08:58,635 --> 00:08:59,636
Come on!

69
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,389
There!

70
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:07,102
I really like how
you play the trumpet. Like Gabriel!

71
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,690
It's a cornet.
Gabriel plays the sax. Are you okay?

72
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,111
Whatever it is, don't go home with it.
Stay with me.

73
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:19,030
Just for the night. Please.

74
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,296
My ears are ringing.

75
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,909
What a night!

76
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,997
I was there with the Dutchman.

77
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:13,293
- It says you saw the bomb coming.
- Yeah, so I saved Dutch's ass.

78
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,587
You saved his ass?

79
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:18,673
Let me take care of that.

80
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,925
Joe, you want to pick this up?

81
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:23,970
- Since when you got money?
- I did a couple of jobs.

82
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,223
Coffee, home fries, eggs...

83
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:39,486
Saving Dutch Schultz's ass!
The Dwyer brothers are in.

84
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,906
- In?
- Popke, come with us.

85
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:46,409
Wait up, Vince!
You're some bigtime hero, Dixie!

86
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:51,122
- The Dutchman's telling everybody.
- I got the rakes on the Dutchman!

87
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,503
Vinnie, what the hell is this?
You wanna work for a bootlegger?

88
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,054
- You don't kill a fly on Ma's plate!
- Did I get it?

89
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:10,141
- I didn't get him.
- Something is wrong with you.

90
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:11,935
Behave yourselves.

91
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,441
- You ready for the contest?
- Yeah. - Let me see your set.

92
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:23,363
- It's awful and I hate it.
- Oh, you love it!

93
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,826
- That's why you'll win.
- Let me see something.

94
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,871
- Done quietly!
- Right. - Thank you.

95
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:40,213
You're dragging!
The master must try it.

96
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,173
Master of what?

97
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:50,932
Look, Mama! - You gotta do it
pretty to get into the Cotton Club.

98
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,020
Quietly, Mother.

99
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,697
That's
gonna get you to the Cotton Club!

100
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:11,703
- The Cotton Club...
- No new steps...

101
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:14,873
- Too important today.
- Today's audition gotta be stronger!

102
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,960
- Stronger?
- You can't fool the Cotton Club!

103
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,131
You start giving white people
what they want,

104
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,135
- soon you got no blood left.
- What are we doing?

105
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:31,222
- First rhythm, then social?
- No, save it till later.

106
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:35,268
- I wanna get it out of the way.
- Hello, Dixie!

107
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,897
- Where'd you get this money?
- I do business.

108
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:42,400
- You do business?
- I'm like Jesse James.

109
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,986
You work with Jesse? Who's this kid?

110
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,614
- Ed Popke.
- A sad case.

111
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:53,787
I got some big news
that I didn't tell you yet.

112
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:56,581
- What?
- Big news!

113
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,959
- I suddenly got married!
- What?

114
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,671
I got married!

115
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:07,342
You tell me you want a job with Dutch
but don't mention you got hitched?

116
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:11,012
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

117
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,933
We want to be alone,
with just the family, alright?

118
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:20,522
- This is her! Patsy, my brother.
- Congratulations!

119
00:13:21,106 --> 00:13:24,275
Don't congratulate the bride,
congratulate the groom.

120
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,158
- One, two, three...
- On your tippytoes!

121
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:35,412
One, two, three, now turn...

122
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:39,332
One, two, three...

123
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,921
Would you put some clothes on!
I've told her about that!

124
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,174
I know, but there's
a rat in the house!

125
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:52,220
Tail this big! It's behind
the curtain, wanna take a look?

126
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,723
It's behind the curtain.

127
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,355
You were in town all day yesterday
and you didn't call me once!

128
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,358
This one goes up, that one goes up,
around my neck in a hug!

129
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,906
- Oh, Mom with the dancing feet!
- He saved Dutch Schultz's life, Mom!

130
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,242
- Why?
- I didn't know who it was.

131
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:19,247
He is an absolutely awful man.
Patsy, put some clothes on!

132
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:23,752
- I did!
- Leave the cat alone!

133
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,631
- See you next week.
- Want me to take your jacket?

134
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:30,216
Thanks.

135
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:36,222
I want you to tell your mother
everything you learned.

136
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,643
One, two, now turn...
Tell your mother.

137
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,609
- How did your dancing audition go?
- They loved us.

138
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,487
- Think you'll work at the Cotton Club?
- Nah.

139
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:55,116
- You're waiting till the big time, huh?
- We'll see.

140
00:14:55,617 --> 00:15:00,455
- He's showing off again.
- He's got a lot to show off!

141
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,499
Good luck, boys!

142
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:06,419
- Where you going?
- Excuse me!

143
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,508
Excuse me, I'm having a heart attack!

144
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:16,262
- You look kinda sick, I think.
- Please, Miss, I'm...

145
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,310
- She pushed you over the cliff!
- I'm gonna climb back up!

146
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:26,064
- I'll see you later, man.
- So long, Holmes.

147
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:29,818
Mr. Stark!

148
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:34,739
I'm just excited
about the audition and wanted

149
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,952
- to find out how we did.
- Everybody liked you.

150
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,330
I'm gonna put you in the next show.

151
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,500
- We're in the next show?
- You're in the next show.

152
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,544
Thank you! Listen,

153
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,796
you white folks are so smart.

154
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:56,928
- Ladies and gentleman...
- Much smoother! Now, pivot.

155
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:03,268
- ...the Cotton Club girls!
- You're in the wrong spot!

156
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,270
Sorry, Miss Webb.

157
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,732
- What's your name?
- Get out of here!

158
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,110
- What are you doing here?
- I just spoke with Mr. Stark...

159
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,988
I don't care, you belong to me.

160
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:20,577
You don't use that front door,
use the back door. Don't do it again!

161
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:48,271
- Are you Dixie Dwyer?
- Yeah, that's right.

162
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,149
The Dutchman wants to put you to work.

163
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:56,738
- He says you play the piano, too?
- I play a little piano.

164
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:00,241
- He wants you to play a little party.
- Party? How much?

165
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:01,993
150.

166
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:06,998
- 150? When?
- Right now.

167
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,385
- What do they call ya?
- Nobody calls me nothing.

168
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:21,680
- Not even your mother?
- I didn't have a mother.

169
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:25,642
They found me in a garbage pail.

170
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:49,582
- How you doing?
- Sol. What's in the bugle case?

171
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,418
Bugle.

172
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:03,888
- What kind of party is this?
- You've never been to one like this.

173
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:08,518
Maybe I don't want to go to one like
this. - You do want to go.

174
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,480
Wait here.

175
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,746
Don't screw up!
Keep an eye on the boss. Hello!

176
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:31,416
The cornet player.
I don't believe it, you made it.

177
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:36,421
- What the hell is this?
- Pow! Bugle boy, meet Jesse James.

178
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,340
What are you doing here?

179
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,761
I went up to Dutch and got a job.
You saved his ass, he saved mine.

180
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:46,222
- You asked him for a job?
- Yeah, I said, "I'm begging."

181
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,975
- What about you?
- I'm with Vinnie.

182
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,775
- I made it.
- I got your brother on my payroll.

183
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,652
- He told me about it.
- We got too many Jews here.

184
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:01,946
- We need some Irishmen.
- Since when?

185
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:06,076
- Not too many!
- I love these tough micks. Wardrobe.

186
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,788
- Did you bring your horn?
- Here is the first of the money.

187
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:14,417
My horn?
I thought you wanted my piano!

188
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,879
You can't work for Dutch
and walk around like this, alright?

189
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,549
- What do you want to hear?
- Listen,

190
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:25,595
I got a lot of things to do.
I got this girl coming...

191
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,932
She sings. She's got her own music.

192
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,105
- You read music, right?
- Yeah, I read it. I write it.

193
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,065
I play it.

194
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,861
- I sleep with it, too.
- Play for her, don't sleep with her.

195
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,992
Lucky Boy, relax. I like you.

196
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:06,136
I'm looking for Mr. Schultz. Do you
know him? - Everybody knows him.

197
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:09,347
- Do you work for him?
- I work for myself.

198
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:13,560
- My name is Owney Madden. And you?
- You're Owney Madden?

199
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,522
You're very famous.

200
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:21,151
I'm Vera Cicero.
You own the Cotton Club, right?

201
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,695
I own a lot of things, Miss Cicero.

202
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,781
- He's in the next room.
- Thank you.

203
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:37,417
Right this way, Mr. Flynn.

204
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:48,678
Thank you, Mr. Flynn.

205
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,307
Wanna lighten up a bit, doll?

206
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,064
Your accompaniment...

207
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,232
A piano player.

208
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,281
- The little girl.
- The altar boy.

209
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,785
Schultzie, we gotta talk.
We're having a party time.

210
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:17,666
It's time, Dutch.

211
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:22,253
- Let's get at it.
- Fine, we're set up down the hall.

212
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:56,079
- What about you?
- I sing, tell a few jokes.

213
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,375
Tell me a joke then.

214
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:05,296
Hello, Sucker.

215
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:13,930
Dammit!
Shut the fuck up! Shut up...

216
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:18,101
- You had the bomb dropped!
- What's the point?

217
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:21,604
- Shut up!
- It's bullshit!

218
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:25,734
- I'm telling you! You, too!
- Shit!

219
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,321
Now we heard it all now!
That's the end of it.

220
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:36,286
There's plenty of money in Harlem
for everybody. It's getting hotter.

221
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:42,083
You start this war here and you
got a brand new enemy... me.

222
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:44,377
And me.

223
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,968
You're here because you both agreed
to this truce. And it is a truce.

224
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:56,431
Tomorrow is a business day. Clear?

225
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,438
Is it clear?

226
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,984
Then shake hands!

227
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:10,695
Shake fucking hands!

228
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,699
In the next room, gentlemen,

229
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:18,703
is the best food, drink and pussy
available at any rice in New York.

230
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,211
I suggest you take a sample
of these things. And try to remember

231
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:31,549
this is why we work so hard.
To live like kings!

232
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,302
Get out of here!

233
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,771
So you finished the funny business?

234
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:49,025
I shook his hand.
I should have cut it off.

235
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:52,404
Calm down, you'll overheat.

236
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:58,284
- You two getting along?
- We're making contact.

237
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:03,581
You look like a beautiful doll.
You know that tune?

238
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,459
- "Beautiful Doll?" Yeah.
- Play it!

239
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:08,503
Go ahead.

240
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,380
Yeah, sure.

241
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,810
How you doing?

242
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:28,356
Anything you want.
Anything, just ask me for it.

243
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:35,155
I want to own my own nightclub.

244
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,756
- We'll have a little peace and quiet.
- Come on. Hey, Monk!

245
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:57,052
- Let those two kids in.
- Okay, go ahead.

246
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,598
- Nobody else right now.
- Help yourselves!

247
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:05,101
It was good, bringing you guys
together. - We got a little

248
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:08,355
territory settled.
We ain't together.

249
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,983
- You sound like an Irish pig!
- Alright, alright!

250
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:14,652
You wanna go right now?

251
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,906
- Stop it!
- I'll break your fascist face!

252
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:21,117
- ...pretty well.
- Owney's got that diplomat...

253
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:22,576
...Guaranteed.

254
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,581
If Owney was in Washington,
we wouldn't have this shit in Europe.

255
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,542
I like keeping the fucking
Jew boys where they belong.

256
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,921
Them and the niggers,
then we're alright.

257
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:37,050
- Jew's just a jig turned inside out.
- That's enough.

258
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:38,968
Son of a bitch!

259
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,810
Alright, Dutch, that's enough.

260
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:50,021
Yeah, that's enough.

261
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,360
Somebody ought to cut out
your brain and pickle it.

262
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:59,197
- You are a crazy son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry.

263
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:02,117
- Fuckin' sorry as a human being!
- Hey, kid!

264
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:05,620
- Can you drive?
- Yeah. - Then take your friend

265
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:10,000
someplace quiet, away from here.
Take the lady with you. Go!

266
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,627
- And fast!
- Get it out!

267
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,887
Look, I don't want you to get lost.
I need to know where you are.

268
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:24,639
Say, kid!

269
00:26:25,223 --> 00:26:26,223
Come here!

270
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:32,731
Don't you worry about it.
I got the fix on stuff like this.

271
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:36,151
- Whatever you say, Dutch.
- Alright.

272
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:38,695
Just right up over there.

273
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,740
I'll see you.

274
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,128
Don't go anyplace.
I wanna know where both of you are.

275
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,432
I need to eat something.

276
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,565
Did I say the wrong thing?

277
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,568
You don't feel for Mr. Flynn?

278
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:23,990
Mr. Flynn was a bootlegger.
That's how they live. Wise up, sap!

279
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,053
Why not come inside?

280
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,099
Not this time.

281
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:55,855
You don't belong to me.
You're Dutch's property.

282
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:22,090
- Hi, Joey.
- What's new?

283
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:24,843
What'cha doing?

284
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:28,179
Call is 15 minutes to places!

285
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,066
Mr. Stark,
we're the Williams brothers.

286
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:45,363
- The Williams!
- Oh, the Williams brothers.

287
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,200
Charlie, show them their
dressing rooms. - Thank you.

288
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,711
- We're here!
- Welcome to the Cotton Club.

289
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,891
- You come in right here with the vocal.
- All the way up...

290
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:16,019
That's Duke Ellington!

291
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:33,661
Put up the wing.

292
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:46,633
- Hiya, Dixie. This your family?
- Showing the newlyweds a good time!

293
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:52,013
Some of the best musicians
in the world play here.

294
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:55,642
- ...all this money!
- Good thing niggers ain't allowed!

295
00:29:56,059 --> 00:30:01,147
- They can't get into their own club?
- Owney Madden owns this club.

296
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:06,194
- May I take your coats?
- Wait till you see this!

297
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:33,847
Look at the rump on that baby!
Hey, baby, come over here!

298
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:40,687
Vinnie, come on!

299
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:44,232
These are the times
that try men's souls.

300
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:53,241
- Is this the best table in the house?
- The best for you, my friend.

301
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:57,287
- You ain't no friend of mine!
- Sit down, watch the show!

302
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,876
- I know that man, Owney Madden.
- Where?

303
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:07,756
Right over there.
He backs a lot of Broadway shows.

304
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:11,760
They call him "Mr. Broadway."
I wonder if he remembers me.

305
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,512
- Where you going?
- Hey, Ma, wait!

306
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:27,025
Mr. Madden?

307
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:29,944
Owen.

308
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,494
Well, well!

309
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,417
- A pleasure to see you again.
- My son Michael. He plays cornet.

310
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:48,755
- I think you should hire him.
- It's my mother, she loves me.

311
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,883
Don't you already have a job?

312
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,178
I play here and there. Nothing steady.

313
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:59,140
You gotta be careful
who you play piano for.

314
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,851
Alright, come around and see me.

315
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:06,231
Maybe sometime soon.
Thanks, Mr. Madden.

316
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:19,577
What do you think of this Dwyer kid?

317
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,748
- I'm not impressed.
- Do you trust him?

318
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,752
- Dutch seems to.
- Ahhh.

319
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,673
Dutch relies on fear.
It's loyalty we need.

320
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,135
I'm thinking about the coast.

321
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:38,763
The kid looks good. Talks pretty.

322
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,808
I don't trust no one with a nickname.

323
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:47,647
- What about your nickname, Frenchy?
- That's different.

324
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,233
- Why?
- I'm trustworthy.

325
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:53,820
Oh, yeah.
What would I do without ya?

326
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:40,909
I'm always watching you, Williams.

327
00:34:28,623 --> 00:34:31,793
Nice place!
How come you never brought me here?

328
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,380
The Cotton Club?
Frances, I almost never come here.

329
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,010
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Schultz.
- Really, I don't come here much.

330
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:43,888
- Hey, Dutch!
- Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

331
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,523
The Dutchman just come in.

332
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:58,028
Bring him up to the coop, right?

333
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,009
I bet you could do that?

334
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:25,555
Do that little thing
with your tongue. Come on!

335
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:32,729
- Compliments of the house!
- That Owney!

336
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:37,108
You gonna pop the cork?
50 bucks if you hit the ceiling!

337
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,821
- Hello Dutch...
- Oh, hello! - How've you been?

338
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:44,115
- Have a cigar.
- Take a walk.

339
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:48,536
They read your name in the papers,
they think they know you.

340
00:35:49,037 --> 00:35:52,165
- Give me a light.
- Anything you need, Dutch?

341
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:57,629
- Yeah, why don't you bring me the moon!
- It's up on the roof.

342
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:02,092
Owen would like
to show you his pigeons up there.

343
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:05,303
Owney and his pigeons.

344
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,517
- I'll be right back. Enjoy yourself!
- Could you leave somebody with me?

345
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,560
Yeah. Sol, come here.

346
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:20,026
Now you're gonna have
a good time, so just relax.

347
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,117
Follow me.

348
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:31,496
What's with the pet pigeons?
I used to catch 'em and cook 'em.

349
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:33,957
Don't tell that to Owen.

350
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:36,835
I haven't been able
to eat or sleep for days. You okay?

351
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:39,587
Oh, you shouldn't fall so soon.

352
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:43,675
All I want to do is marry you,
take you away from this. - Away?

353
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,553
- I practically just got here.
- Me, too.

354
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:51,349
- Look, let's never be separated.
- Can I do this number?

355
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,838
- What are you doing here?
- He likes to look at me.

356
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:25,759
He says if his wife leaves early
he wants to see me.

357
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:29,804
- He wants to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

358
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:33,892
I don't want to talk to him!
My family's over here tonight.

359
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:39,230
Do yourself a favor. Don't rile him.
You know how he gets.

360
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:43,568
- I don't want any part of him.
- He can get you anything you need.

361
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,571
Beautiful one.

362
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,789
I was gonna leave it to you
what the restitution would be.

363
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,794
Then I realized, you're such a cheap
son of a bitch, you probably

364
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:04,756
wouldn't satisfy
my sense of right or wrong.

365
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:09,803
What I want is
either 25,000 in cash now,

366
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,597
on the table,

367
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:16,893
or 10,000 a month
for the next four months.

368
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:21,856
The first offer is a bargain.
I know you love a bargain.

369
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,237
That's fair. I heard.

370
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:31,241
25.

371
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,078
Sometimes you're a big man, Dutch.

372
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:39,165
- You know how I got that big?
- How?

373
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:41,584
I ate a pigeon every day.

374
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,225
Did'ya see Dixie here?

375
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:50,528
- 300 a week.
- I thought you said 200.

376
00:39:50,945 --> 00:39:53,782
I could say 50 and you'd take it.

377
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,869
Dutch, I appreciate it,
but guns, knives, bombs...

378
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:02,540
- That's not my life. I play music.
- I'm telling you

379
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:06,544
you got a job.
You got it? All I want you to do

380
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:11,883
is to take Vera around. She can't
stand Abbadabba, but she likes you.

381
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,640
If I didn't like you,
you'd be dead. Do you understand that?

382
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:26,022
Sure I understand.
It's nice to be liked.

383
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,198
- I gotta see you after the show.
- No.

384
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,575
- Tomorrow!
- No.

385
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:41,788
- You gotta!
- Alright, I'll tell you what.

386
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:46,001
I have a meeting at ten at the
Abyssinian Church. Meet me there.

387
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:03,351
- I'm new. I'm trying to meet people.
- Watch your act, nigger!

388
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,729
You don't handle the merchandise.

389
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:12,610
There's Gloria Swanson!

390
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:16,573
You're my biggest star!

391
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,534
You are a very beautiful person.

392
00:41:21,036 --> 00:41:25,874
- You're more beautiful than I am.
- You have a chance to be in pictures.

393
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,835
You are gorgeous.

394
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:35,050
- Well, I can't miss, can I?
- Call me at the studio. Monday.

395
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:38,470
- Monday.
- Yes. Goodbye.

396
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:46,227
- That was Gloria Swanson.
- Right here she said it.

397
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:51,149
Gloria Swanson says I'm gorgeous
and I should have a big future.

398
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,445
Hey, kid.

399
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,994
Good show. See you tomorrow.

400
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:06,581
- Not tonight.
- I don't take "no" for an answer.

401
00:42:07,082 --> 00:42:11,586
You have to this time.
I've got a private life, you know.

402
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:49,582
The only trouble with the nigger
numbers racket is the risk. I like

403
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,211
things you can fix,
like a horse race. Or a politician.

404
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:56,423
- I think I can fix the number.
- What, you kidding me?

405
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:58,967
What have you been drinking? Dixie!

406
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:03,930
Play that Beiderbecke tune for me.
And see if the piano player knows it.

407
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,143
- Where do the numbers come from?
- You know "Singing the Blues?"

408
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:16,443
- You take that thing everywhere?
- Dutchman likes the sound of my horn.

409
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:19,863
- His master's voice.
- Look who's talking.

410
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:22,532
But I'm getting my own nightclub.

411
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:25,827
Think about it for a minute.

412
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:28,455
That number comes in the 7th race.

413
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:37,756
So I look at the payoff totals
from the first six races and...

414
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,229
What if I don't like the number?

415
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,399
I place last minute bets.

416
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,070
And that changes
the last number to what I want.

417
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,988
Any number!

418
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:06,242
And you can figure it in your head?

419
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,453
The one and only.

420
00:44:10,163 --> 00:44:12,290
They're fixing the world with math.

421
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:20,674
- You ever play the horses, Sol?
- When I was a kid I raced rats.

422
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:28,556
If you can do this, we can take over
the whole Harlem numbers racket!

423
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:32,894
The service is lousy here.
Why don't you get me a gin, darling?

424
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:37,482
You can own Harlem,
lock, stock, and barrel.

425
00:44:39,651 --> 00:44:41,861
Bottoms up, Dutchess.

426
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:44,781
I'm really sorry about that.

427
00:44:48,868 --> 00:44:52,872
I saw you spilling that drink.
You ain't clumsy. I didn't like it.

428
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:58,128
You ever do anything like that again,
I mess up your face. You hear me?

429
00:44:59,254 --> 00:45:01,798
Yeah, yeah.
I won't spill any more drinks.

430
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:12,267
I want you to pick up my laundry.
It's at the Chink's.

431
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:13,893
Yeah.

432
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:19,607
- What's up?
- Three bankers.

433
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:24,154
15,000 from 113th, 20,000 from 72nd,
and 21,000 from 150th Street.

434
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:28,408
- Beautiful. You'll be the next boss!
- Come on.

435
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:38,710
- Come on, get over there!
- One more time!

436
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:49,054
- You still mad at me?
- I was never mad at you.

437
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:54,142
I just felt you should respect my
private life. - Let's get married now.

438
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:59,397
- We could have lunch anytime!
- Dalbert, no chance.

439
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:03,485
I got too many things to do.
I want to make it.

440
00:46:03,985 --> 00:46:07,238
Really make it. I want to do Broadway.

441
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:13,286
- You want to do white show business.
- Isn't that what it is?

442
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:22,587
Wait a minute!
I can't just run out like this!

443
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:26,633
Wait a second here.
I like that you're taller than me.

444
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:32,180
- Most men are intimidated.
- We're going to the top together!

445
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:34,641
Dalbert, wait!

446
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,982
- Sugar, marry me!
- I'm already married.

447
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,362
You're the president of the club.
So you can perform the ceremony.

448
00:46:47,862 --> 00:46:51,324
- And I can't wait no longer.
- If you take this man

449
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,202
for your husband,
you're crazier than he is.

450
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:59,541
- Sugar, would you...
- Plus, ain't no women allowed.

451
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:08,800
- Why not no women?
- 'Cause this is the Hoofers Club!

452
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:13,221
- Hoofers! I'll show you.
- This is going to be something.

453
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,182
This is what you do.
Give me a little music.

454
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:42,625
Heelology!

455
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,654
Don't be so mean!

456
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:14,783
To the floor!

457
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,919
I'm coming through!

458
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:33,927
Look out!

459
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,175
- No, no!
- What? My brother...

460
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,721
He's doing it!

461
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:25,353
This is the way it goes!
One, two, three, four... now!

462
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:24,412
What is this? Where's the Duesenberg?

463
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:28,166
- Where's Dutch?
- Dutch can't make it tonight.

464
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,919
I'm your escort.

465
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:37,133
I'll do anything for money, too.

466
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:45,225
- Where we headed? Not the theater.
- We ain't going to the theater.

467
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:48,770
What is this, a kidnapping?

468
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,399
Would you like that?
I think I'm up to it.

469
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,778
I don't know why,
but you do move me.

470
00:50:57,404 --> 00:50:59,072
In unusual places.

471
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:01,533
Where? Your appendix?

472
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:05,787
We'll sit at Dutch's table.

473
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:08,456
Go ahead, will you walk?

474
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,126
Keep moving!

475
00:51:12,627 --> 00:51:13,627
Sit down!

476
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:21,970
Sit down!

477
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,141
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

478
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:42,115
I never have figured you out.

479
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,577
That's funny. I know all about you.

480
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:51,916
I can imitate your walk.
The way you play your cornet.

481
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:54,251
Like how?

482
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:01,634
I know a few things about you, too.

483
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,096
Like what you look like making love.

484
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:12,062
When did you see that? - Ever since
I put you to bed that night.

485
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:28,203
The Golem has arrived.

486
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,540
- He follows me everywhere.
- The Golem is in love.

487
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:37,837
Don't be ridiculous.
He just keeps tabs on me for Dutch.

488
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:41,341
Why do I feel
like I'm walking the dog or something?

489
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,344
I want to dance.
Let's dance for Dutch.

490
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:04,406
- I used to dance for a living.
- No kidding?

491
00:53:04,906 --> 00:53:07,742
I worked in tearooms when I was 18.

492
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:10,412
Tell me all about it.

493
00:53:13,498 --> 00:53:16,835
These old ladies would pay me
to put my arms around them.

494
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,005
Waltz them off their feet.

495
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,259
Pay two bucks
in the afternoon. Plus tips.

496
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,137
More for the night work.

497
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:31,099
- In private. If you could stand it!
- Could you?

498
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:35,478
Sure. Look at me tonight.

499
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:45,739
Dutch likes you to dance, huh?

500
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,583
Dance!

501
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,878
You dance for me! Get up!

502
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:04,090
Come on, you dance!

503
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,304
You wanna dance?
I'll dance with you, come on!

504
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:15,935
What makes you think...

505
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,063
That's enough!

506
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:23,401
I'll dance with you next time, Sol.

507
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:31,326
- I just cracked my heel.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

508
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:34,245
- Yes, you did.
- No, I'm crazy about you.

509
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:38,917
You tell that to all the girls you
beat up. - I live here.

510
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:49,511
It belongs to my brother's wife.
She's about your size.

511
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,195
To anything!

512
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:09,655
To anything!

513
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,598
- Is that you, Vincent?
- No, it's Michael.

514
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:39,144
- It's okay, go back to bed.
- Goodnight, Michael.

515
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:40,562
Goodnight!

516
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,064
Michael?

517
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,443
Yeah, Michael.

518
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,822
Well, Michael, where do I change?

519
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:28,318
You feel like
you're on your honeymoon?

520
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:31,696
Honeymoons are never this dangerous.

521
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,783
If he came in here right now,
he'd kill us. - Forget about him.

522
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:36,660
Who?

523
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,545
I'm quitting the Dutchman.

524
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:54,427
I'm not running around for his
cigarettes while he strokes you.

525
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:58,807
I'm not waiting in the car...

526
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:05,689
- while he does whatever he does to you.
- Whatever he does.

527
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:10,235
All I know is...
I'm getting away from that bastard!

528
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:13,530
You're a tough guy.

529
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,914
Some things you can't do.

530
00:57:26,751 --> 00:57:30,463
You can't see a murder,
then come home,

531
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,049
fuck your friend, who loves you,

532
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,301
leave him, then go home,

533
00:57:35,802 --> 00:57:38,972
and wake up
and have breakfast with a psychopath.

534
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,352
You can't do that, can you?

535
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:51,526
Yes.

536
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:09,669
- Madden upstairs?
- Yeah, he's in.

537
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:21,890
- How are ya?
- Alright, alright.

538
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:25,352
- You says I should come see you.
- Oh, yeah...

539
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,688
You're seeing difficult times.

540
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,106
You noticed.

541
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:37,572
- You got any ideas for me?
- If you was colored, we'd book you.

542
00:58:38,406 --> 00:58:41,993
- The great tragedy of my life.
- Listen...

543
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,168
I heard what
Gloria Swanson was saying about you.

544
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,213
A lot of my cash
goes to different places.

545
00:58:55,423 --> 00:58:59,219
Some goes to Hollywood,
and to the studios and to movies.

546
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:04,057
You could front for us.

547
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:12,232
- What do you mean?
- Be my face on the coast.

548
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,655
What about the Dutchman?

549
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:23,743
I'll keep him off your back.
Come and have some lunch.

550
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:27,998
Swell, Mr. Madden.

551
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,583
- See you tonight!
- See you later!

552
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,713
I got a specialty act.
Remember that solo we talked about?

553
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,965
- Can you do it tonight?
- Of course.

554
00:59:37,424 --> 00:59:40,385
- You're on right after the Duke.
- I'm there.

555
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:44,305
- What's this about a solo?
- They asked me to do a solo.

556
00:59:44,806 --> 00:59:49,561
- They asked you? You didn't ask them?
- I talked to them.

557
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,022
Clay...

558
00:59:52,981 --> 00:59:56,609
Look, it's a step up, man!
It's good for both of us.

559
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,070
Don't give me trouble. Shake my hand.

560
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:02,282
Shake your hand?
I ought to spit in your hand!

561
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:06,745
How could you? I'm your brother!

562
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:09,414
How could you go behind my back?

563
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:13,376
You want a solo? You got one!

564
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:16,713
On stage and off!

565
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,103
Your brother wants to see you.

566
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:44,741
See you later, Vinnie.

567
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:50,080
What's the urgency?

568
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:55,168
- I gotta go to a doctor.
- For what? You okay?

569
01:00:55,585 --> 01:01:00,507
I got a small graze.
Can't go to a hospital I know.

570
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:03,510
- 'Cause they'll find out.
- Jesus Christ, kid!

571
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:04,969
What?

572
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:10,892
- What happened?
- It's just a graze.

573
01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:14,688
- A graze from what?
- I was fighting niggers.

574
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,441
The niggers, Harlem niggers.

575
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,569
Why?

576
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:25,699
Look at me. Why do you think?

577
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:31,746
I should kick the shit out of you.
What are you doing fighting coloreds?

578
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:36,126
Who do you work for?
What's the matter, Dix?

579
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:43,967
Do I look like a boss in this suit?

580
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:49,305
- Keep two thugs behind you and you do.
- I want them to notice the suit!

581
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:53,101
Spill a little gravy
like you always do, they'll notice it.

582
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:58,815
You know, Dixie took a screen test.

583
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:03,236
- What's a screen test?
- They shot some pictures.

584
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,531
- Now they want me to make a movie.
- In Hollywood?

585
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,159
- That's right.
- Forget it! - What do you mean?

586
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,995
- It's his big chance!
- They want me to play a gangster.

587
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,998
- You?
- In fact, I did an imitation of you.

588
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:19,169
"Hey, come here. Do what I tell
you to do or I'll plug ya!"

589
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:24,132
Owney arranged the whole thing.
He's co-financing

590
01:02:24,632 --> 01:02:28,470
the movie. He said you wouldn't mind
if I left for the coast.

591
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:37,604
Playback Dixie Dwyer. Sound!

592
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,193
Here he comes. He's in egg-cream.
- Madden always had good judgment.

593
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:45,362
- Right.
- What's the kid's name?

594
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,657
Dixie Dwyer. Keep an eye on him.

595
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:51,701
He's fantastic. He's coming in now.

596
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:54,871
Unbelievable. Watch him, watch him!

597
01:02:57,832 --> 01:03:02,587
First kid you ever sent me
that doesn't sound like a soprano.

598
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:05,382
He's the greatest. He'll become...

599
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:08,343
- Hold it, hold it, Sully!
- What? What?

600
01:03:08,802 --> 01:03:11,554
- This kid can't act.
- Alright, I can see it.

601
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:15,767
He has a good face, good voice,
doesn't look like a fruit.

602
01:03:16,184 --> 01:03:18,728
- Not at all.
- He looks like

603
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:21,356
a gangster. What's his name again?

604
01:03:21,856 --> 01:03:24,234
Dixie Dwyer. A great name!

605
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:27,237
A fake name. The first thing...

606
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,781
I'll decide about the name.

607
01:03:30,198 --> 01:03:34,411
- I like the name. Keep the name.
- Put him under contract.

608
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:39,708
We'll send him to the coast. We'll
give him a shot. - Fantastic.

609
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,923
Anyone who moves is a dead nigger!

610
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,847
You! St. Clair!

611
01:03:54,347 --> 01:03:56,891
The Dutchman
wants you in his numbers racket.

612
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:08,153
Madame St. Clair!

613
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:13,783
Gentlemen, we are here because
Mr. Jewett says he can

614
01:04:14,242 --> 01:04:17,954
protect us from the white invaders.
Is that true?

615
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:23,918
I know how the Dutchman thinks.
I see him operate with the Flynns.

616
01:04:24,377 --> 01:04:27,464
You meet a gun with a gun.

617
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:32,260
And I got all the guns you need.

618
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:35,930
- Hire him!
- I don't want no parts of guns.

619
01:04:36,681 --> 01:04:40,894
- Or I'll leave the numbers business.
- It's not about guns, it's politics.

620
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:47,484
You connected with Jimmy Hines
in Tammany? They control the police.

621
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:51,488
Look, I come to do you people a favor.

622
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:54,699
That man is leaning on you.

623
01:04:56,534 --> 01:04:58,828
You wanna lean back or no?

624
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:09,130
It seems we will pass on your offer.

625
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:13,051
We are not ready
to go to war at this time.

626
01:05:13,802 --> 01:05:18,014
Then you don't know
you already lost the war.

627
01:07:37,404 --> 01:07:38,863
Lila!

628
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:43,201
- You can't do this to me, Lila!
- Do what?

629
01:07:43,618 --> 01:07:46,955
Disappear like you do.
Where do you go all day?

630
01:07:47,414 --> 01:07:50,542
I have a private life now.

631
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,294
I can't talk to you here.

632
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:55,839
Let's go up on the roof.

633
01:07:56,256 --> 01:07:59,634
I told you that there are
other people in my life.

634
01:08:00,093 --> 01:08:03,138
- I want to talk.
- This is Madden's place!

635
01:08:03,555 --> 01:08:07,017
I want to talk to you now.
Now just come on! Come on!

636
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:09,978
- Not up here.
- We won't get into trouble.

637
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:14,357
- Let's go outside.
- You moved. Got a new address.

638
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,610
How am I supposed to find you?

639
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:22,115
- What are you doing up here?
- We're just going to talk.

640
01:08:22,574 --> 01:08:26,161
Yeah! You come up here
to fornicate like two dogs.

641
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:29,539
You don't belong up here. Get down.

642
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:33,251
- Why can't we...
- I'm fed up with you!

643
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,130
- Please!
- I'll take care of you!

644
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,551
- Wait a minute!
- Come here!

645
01:08:44,346 --> 01:08:47,349
You know what? See this?

646
01:08:48,516 --> 01:08:50,060
Stop it!

647
01:08:50,477 --> 01:08:53,605
- Get out of my life, woman!
- Lila, stay out of this!

648
01:08:54,105 --> 01:08:59,027
- You gonna stop fuckin' around, nigger?
- Yes, yes!

649
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:02,697
Get out of here!

650
01:09:03,657 --> 01:09:04,783
Out!

651
01:09:06,117 --> 01:09:09,579
I'm quitting!
I'm leaving this dump!

652
01:09:09,996 --> 01:09:14,584
How can you treat decent human beings
like that? I know what I have to do!

653
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,004
- Must I just take anything from him?
- What can you do?

654
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:22,175
- Kill the motherfucker!
- Don't be stupid, Sandman!

655
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:25,220
You want me to take on Madden's man?

656
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:29,265
You want me to take on the most
powerful white mob in the city?

657
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:32,185
Then
you truly have someone on your ass.

658
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:36,064
There's only one way to get even
with a guy like Mike Best.

659
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:39,192
Treat him like a fireplug.
Piss on him.

660
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,529
- Listen to the man.
- I'll piss on his grave!

661
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:45,740
I can kill him,
but you can dance on his grave.

662
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:47,534
Listen to me, Sandman.

663
01:09:48,576 --> 01:09:51,997
I'm not a dancer.
I'm a pimp, I'm a thief.

664
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:57,836
I'm a gambler.
I don't have no talent for dancing.

665
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:02,549
I can't even get in the Cotton Club,
where my own people are the stars.

666
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:07,137
Because I'm black!
There are only two things for me.

667
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,182
One is stay black.
The other is die.

668
01:10:12,517 --> 01:10:15,061
I got nothing but the underworld.

669
01:10:15,437 --> 01:10:20,567
That is where I dance.
Let me ask you, Sandman:

670
01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:23,820
Where do you dance?

671
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,707
I'm gonna kill him with my tap shoes.

672
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,057
Alright, put 'em up!
Turn around and put 'em up!

673
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:54,726
I'm the boss now!

674
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:40,188
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.

675
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:42,065
Enjoy the show.

676
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:48,530
- Not bad, not bad.
- Hi, how you doing?

677
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,939
- How you doing? Been a long time.
- Hi.

678
01:12:23,898 --> 01:12:27,610
- What's Madden doing here?
- I invited him.

679
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:30,030
I gotta go talk to him.

680
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,122
- Dutch, how are ya?
- Your money's no good here tonight.

681
01:12:39,497 --> 01:12:42,417
What's this I read about this
"Mob Boss"?

682
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:47,839
- They say you copied your style?
- You taught me everything I know.

683
01:12:48,882 --> 01:12:53,595
You know,
the lesson ain't finished yet.

684
01:13:09,944 --> 01:13:11,488
Sorry, whites only.

685
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:16,117
Can you get a message
to Angelina for me?

686
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:19,537
- Yeah.
- Tell her Sandman Williams is here.

687
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,539
Okay, sure.

688
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:34,552
Welcome to Vera's!
Everybody's here tonight!

689
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:39,182
Everybody who's somebody.
If you ain't somebody, you ain't here.

690
01:13:41,476 --> 01:13:43,353
Mr. Broadway himself is with us.

691
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,063
Mr. Owney Madden.

692
01:13:45,814 --> 01:13:47,148
Take a bow, Owney!

693
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:52,696
And with him, just back from
Hollywood, is Dixie Dwyer!

694
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:55,115
Get up, come on!

695
01:13:55,657 --> 01:14:00,537
- There comes a time...
- Who the fuck let you in?

696
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:05,208
- I wanna talk to the Dutchman.
- Ah, like that...

697
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,295
- Yeah, go get him!
- You wait here, ya hear?

698
01:14:11,798 --> 01:14:15,427
I'd like to introduce our
lovely songbird, Miss Angelina,

699
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,346
formerly with the Blue Belles.

700
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:21,683
Some garbage is out back,
wants to talk to you.

701
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:26,604
Dutch has some business outside.

702
01:14:50,337 --> 01:14:52,047
- What?
- I wanna talk money.

703
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:57,052
- We get shot up!
- It's part of the game. How much?

704
01:14:57,427 --> 01:15:02,557
We delivered half of Harlem to you.
I want part of the numbers percentage.

705
01:15:02,974 --> 01:15:07,562
Just cause you can handle a gun,
you think you're a boss?

706
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,356
You're nuts!

707
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:12,776
There are a million guys
willing to pull a trigger for me!

708
01:15:14,361 --> 01:15:16,529
But I'll give you a raise.

709
01:15:17,155 --> 01:15:23,036
100 a week,
and 50 for Popke there. Is that fair?

710
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:29,042
Fair? You can take your 100
and shove it up your ass!

711
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:32,295
Wise guy!

712
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:35,632
Get out of here before I blow it off!

713
01:15:50,939 --> 01:15:53,149
How'd you find me?

714
01:15:56,361 --> 01:16:00,615
You may be passing for white,
but you ain't invisible.

715
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:04,703
What time are you through here?

716
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,124
- At two.
- I'll be here.

717
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:56,398
- We'd like to get a room, please.
- Of course, sir.

718
01:17:59,526 --> 01:18:03,154
- Now, how may I... help you?
- A small...

719
01:18:03,571 --> 01:18:06,908
...romantic room,
maybe on the 10th floor.

720
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:12,831
Uh... yes.
Your key, sir.

721
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:20,046
We don't admit mixed couples here.

722
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:23,508
Well, we're colored.

723
01:18:27,387 --> 01:18:30,348
- What color are you?
- My father is colored

724
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:34,686
and my mother's white.
So what color does that make me?

725
01:18:39,316 --> 01:18:43,320
- 417.
- Thank you. No luggage.

726
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,232
- Come on!
- Gotcha!

727
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:40,669
You got people thinking you're white.

728
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:45,882
When I want. Remember I told you
about my private life and the lawyer?

729
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:50,053
Why do you do it?

730
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:54,224
- Because I can.
- So what?

731
01:19:55,642 --> 01:19:58,186
So stop judging me about it!

732
01:20:02,148 --> 01:20:04,234
Vera pays me double what

733
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:09,531
the Cotton Club did!
And she don't ask no questions.

734
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,951
I'm a human being.

735
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:17,122
And that's the way I like it.

736
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:24,337
I can't even get into Vera's
to hear you sing.

737
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:28,299
The doorman won't even let me in.
I can't pass for white.

738
01:20:29,884 --> 01:20:32,262
Just make love to me!

739
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:36,766
I love you. Don't run away from me!

740
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:45,317
Oh, Dalbert!
Just love me, but please understand.

741
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:58,955
Hey, Popke! Shake.

742
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,709
- What?
- Like I said, shake.

743
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:06,296
The Dutchman
wants to do a deal with Vince.

744
01:21:07,088 --> 01:21:08,965
- Come on, shake.
- Forget it...

745
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:54,427
- Wanna buy an apple?
- No. Get lost!

746
01:21:54,803 --> 01:21:56,388
I'll see you about 5 o'clock.

747
01:21:56,805 --> 01:21:59,140
- Scram!
- Thank you!

748
01:22:38,596 --> 01:22:41,349
Old friend outside wants to see you.

749
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:45,103
- Why don't he come in?
- You don't want him in here.

750
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:03,872
You wanna see me?

751
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:11,129
Alright, Frenchy.
Down the stairs. Now.

752
01:23:12,714 --> 01:23:16,051
- What's this all about?
- Let's go.

753
01:23:16,509 --> 01:23:19,638
I thought
your specialty was killing kids.

754
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:23,975
- I'm over 21.
- I don't want to kill you, Frenchy.

755
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:28,271
I just need a little money.
I bet Madden gives you money.

756
01:23:28,688 --> 01:23:32,025
- Doing this could get you in trouble.
- Shut up!

757
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,545
Owney, what's up?

758
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:57,175
Your brother's become
a major pain in the ass.

759
01:23:57,676 --> 01:24:00,178
2 hours ago he snatched Frenchy.

760
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:05,892
Are you kidding? Crazy son of a bitch!

761
01:24:06,351 --> 01:24:10,063
- You didn't know about it?
- How am I supposed to know about it?

762
01:24:10,522 --> 01:24:12,691
I'm asking you a question.

763
01:24:14,234 --> 01:24:17,696
I don't tie your shoes anymore, Owney.

764
01:24:18,113 --> 01:24:20,532
You're a smart man.

765
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:27,580
Your brother's bound for the
graveyard. A mad dog on the streets.

766
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:32,502
- What do you do with a mad dog?
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

767
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,964
He called me and hour ago.

768
01:24:36,339 --> 01:24:39,259
He only trusts you to carry the money.

769
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:45,015
50,000. Count it.

770
01:25:24,429 --> 01:25:27,891
Ladies and Gentlemen, a star...

771
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:31,936
A star is here!
Sandman Williams, my brother.

772
01:25:39,736 --> 01:25:43,406
Clay Williams,
the finest tap dancer in Harlem!

773
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,917
Why don't you and Clayton
dance together?

774
01:26:05,512 --> 01:26:08,390
Wanna finish out
"Crazy Rhythm" together?

775
01:26:11,017 --> 01:26:12,060
Come on!

776
01:27:59,584 --> 01:28:02,379
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

777
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:10,387
- Who is it?
- Arthur.

778
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:18,728
- I'm Vincent's brother.
- You're the guy in the movies.

779
01:28:19,187 --> 01:28:20,230
Vinnie!

780
01:28:25,652 --> 01:28:29,280
You out to conquer the world?
You got an arsenal here.

781
01:28:29,698 --> 01:28:31,282
You got the money?

782
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:44,713
Check Frenchy!

783
01:28:47,007 --> 01:28:49,926
How'd you get so wrong?

784
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:52,846
Oh, Dixie, I ain't wrong.

785
01:28:53,263 --> 01:28:57,225
I wasn't in the car
when those kids got shot.

786
01:28:57,851 --> 01:29:02,439
I wanted that kike in the deep six
but I wouldn't shoot a kid!

787
01:29:02,856 --> 01:29:05,442
Somebody shot 'em. Three or four.

788
01:29:05,984 --> 01:29:10,363
They are crazy guys.
Nobody figured that would happen.

789
01:29:10,822 --> 01:29:13,700
- Where's Frenchy?
- In the bedroom. He's alright.

790
01:29:14,242 --> 01:29:16,411
- You're taking him.
- I've been told.

791
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:27,297
What are you doing?
You got the whole world at war!

792
01:29:27,756 --> 01:29:29,424
This town's Al Capone.

793
01:29:29,924 --> 01:29:36,556
That's pretty good! They got Chicago
shooters coming in to get me!

794
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:39,100
I'm the heavyweight now!

795
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:45,357
How's Ma?

796
01:29:46,024 --> 01:29:49,444
Ma... Ma.
Do you know what she's going through?

797
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:52,072
What she's going through?

798
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:56,034
Does everybody hate me?

799
01:29:57,994 --> 01:30:02,374
They hate shooting a kid.
I know you say you didn't do it.

800
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:04,167
Still, the kid's dead.

801
01:30:04,668 --> 01:30:08,338
And you're gonna take the rap.

802
01:30:15,929 --> 01:30:17,514
Get Frenchy!

803
01:30:19,099 --> 01:30:21,685
Buster, bring him out here!

804
01:30:26,398 --> 01:30:27,524
Slowly!

805
01:30:30,735 --> 01:30:31,987
Come out here!

806
01:30:36,616 --> 01:30:40,453
Dixie had nothing to do with this.
You see that, don't you?

807
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:45,875
I see what I see, I hear what I hear.
Then I make up my mind.

808
01:30:46,376 --> 01:30:49,629
See what I get for being a messenger?

809
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,840
Shall we go?

810
01:30:57,512 --> 01:30:59,723
See you later, kid.

811
01:31:00,265 --> 01:31:01,516
I hope.

812
01:31:04,978 --> 01:31:07,355
Get out of here as fast as you can.

813
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:24,039
Tell Owney
we didn't hurt you, Frenchy.

814
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:32,505
He'll be glad to hear that.

815
01:31:48,063 --> 01:31:49,522
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

816
01:31:50,065 --> 01:31:52,442
- You been home?
- Yeah.

817
01:31:52,984 --> 01:31:55,070
Changed clothes. Cleaned up.

818
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:59,324
- Did they hurt ya?
- Naw. Treated me like a king.

819
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:03,119
- Yeah? Then what happened to your ear?
- Oh, this?

820
01:32:04,537 --> 01:32:07,374
- Playing tennis with Mad Dog Dwyer.
- Tennis?

821
01:32:07,749 --> 01:32:13,922
He hit a ball over my head and I raced
back and crashed in the metal fence.

822
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:17,175
- Cut my ear.
- You were playing tennis?

823
01:32:17,676 --> 01:32:23,431
Yeah. Gave me drinks, good food.
Place was nice. Well-furnished.

824
01:32:23,932 --> 01:32:28,103
Was he trying to kill you with
kindness? I've been worried sick!

825
01:32:28,645 --> 01:32:31,106
How long was I gone?

826
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:34,776
Let me see your watch.

827
01:32:35,193 --> 01:32:37,737
They picked me up about...

828
01:32:38,113 --> 01:32:41,449
Shit, sorry. They picked me up...

829
01:32:44,703 --> 01:32:46,454
- I think I broke it.
- Give it to me!

830
01:32:46,913 --> 01:32:49,666
No, I can fix it. Here.

831
01:32:52,711 --> 01:32:56,673
You cheap son of a bitch!
You only offered 500 dollars for me!

832
01:32:57,007 --> 01:32:59,801
If you were kidnapped,
I wouldn't offer more for you?

833
01:33:00,218 --> 01:33:02,429
- 500 dollars?
- That's what I heard.

834
01:33:02,971 --> 01:33:05,557
50 grand I paid for you!

835
01:33:06,099 --> 01:33:09,728
He only wanted 35,000.
I gave him 50,000 not to hurt you!

836
01:33:10,562 --> 01:33:13,773
500 dollars.
I would've given 500,000 dollars!

837
01:33:14,232 --> 01:33:18,403
I was worried sick about you!
Look what you did to my watch!

838
01:33:21,323 --> 01:33:23,158
- 50 grand?
- Yeah.

839
01:33:27,746 --> 01:33:29,205
What's this?

840
01:33:43,386 --> 01:33:46,014
A platinum watch. You asshole!

841
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,695
- Don't move and you won't get hurt.
- I won't do anything.

842
01:34:01,237 --> 01:34:02,781
Shut up!

843
01:34:25,428 --> 01:34:26,888
Yeah, alright.

844
01:34:28,223 --> 01:34:32,644
- No, we didn't want to hurt Frenchy.
- Hey, where you going?

845
01:34:57,043 --> 01:34:58,586
Goodbye, chump.

846
01:35:27,699 --> 01:35:30,994
This program is coming to you
live from the Cotton Club in Harlem.

847
01:35:31,494 --> 01:35:35,373
And now, Cab Calloway,
doing "Minnie the Moocher"!

848
01:36:43,566 --> 01:36:44,818
See you later!

849
01:36:54,411 --> 01:36:57,747
...meet Frenchy.
Dixie, this is Charlie Luciano.

850
01:36:58,289 --> 01:37:01,167
- How you doing?
- A pleasure. - See you, Dwyer.

851
01:37:02,293 --> 01:37:04,462
Enjoy the show.

852
01:37:30,405 --> 01:37:33,533
It's about time
they let some niggers into this joint.

853
01:37:37,078 --> 01:37:39,581
Welcome to the Cotton Club!

854
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:40,934
- You're looking mighty good tonight!
- Thank you!

855
01:38:41,309 --> 01:38:46,231
- Welcome to the Cotton Club!
- Good to be back.

856
01:39:16,803 --> 01:39:21,975
You wanna be a little less
conspicuous? Your booth's over there.

857
01:39:47,834 --> 01:39:49,502
What's so funny? This guy's crazy!

858
01:39:50,378 --> 01:39:52,839
- He's a very talented man!
- Very talented!

859
01:39:54,341 --> 01:39:56,509
That fucking Dutchman.

860
01:39:58,386 --> 01:40:02,223
If something isn't done about him,
that special prosecutor Dewey

861
01:40:02,849 --> 01:40:06,269
- will bust us all.
- Dutch has gone crazy in Harlem.

862
01:40:07,145 --> 01:40:10,607
- His rackets are very appealing to me.
- Mr. Luciano...

863
01:40:10,982 --> 01:40:15,445
The Dutchman shouldn't be taken
too lightly. - Is he bulletproof?

864
01:40:16,404 --> 01:40:19,532
Now that
his yid is dead, we'll find out.

865
01:40:23,495 --> 01:40:28,124
And then we can divide his Harlem
rackets with everyone in the family.

866
01:40:35,882 --> 01:40:38,927
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.

867
01:40:40,929 --> 01:40:43,139
See ya, Charlie.

868
01:41:25,765 --> 01:41:29,728
- You're not supposed to be back here.
- Don't worry.

869
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:34,316
Meet me at the Bamville at the end
of the show. - I can't no more.

870
01:41:34,816 --> 01:41:38,486
My brothers are clamping down on me.
They say you're married.

871
01:41:38,987 --> 01:41:41,614
Everybody knows I'm married.

872
01:41:42,157 --> 01:41:45,201
What are you doing here? Who are you?

873
01:41:45,577 --> 01:41:49,247
I'm talking with my friend Winona.
Who are you, and why

874
01:41:49,748 --> 01:41:53,710
- are you interrupting me?
- Another fuckin' uppity nigger!

875
01:42:06,556 --> 01:42:09,351
Stay outta trouble with gangsters

876
01:42:09,893 --> 01:42:14,814
if you wanna keep your job. You're the
first dark-skinned girl in the show.

877
01:42:15,315 --> 01:42:18,985
Now go and do what you're supposed to.

878
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:29,579
This uppity nigger
is buying you a drink.

879
01:42:30,121 --> 01:42:33,833
Do not push people around
without some people pushing back!

880
01:42:58,984 --> 01:43:01,277
Talk to me, baby!

881
01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:12,122
Look at that nigger!

882
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:28,888
Keep that motor running.
I'm coming right back.

883
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:51,870
- Dutch wants to kill the prosecutor?
- That's what I heard.

884
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:55,081
Lepke says it can be done.

885
01:43:55,623 --> 01:43:59,461
But it'd kill the rackets
for everyone. This Dewey is a big one.

886
01:43:59,878 --> 01:44:04,257
- That bastard's time is just about up.
- Trigger Mike Coppola!

887
01:44:05,967 --> 01:44:08,219
It could be a problem, Owney.

888
01:44:16,061 --> 01:44:18,355
I know exactly where I'm going.

889
01:44:23,068 --> 01:44:26,571
I knew you were here.
And that she was with you.

890
01:44:26,988 --> 01:44:29,115
You're such a rotten liar!

891
01:44:29,908 --> 01:44:31,701
- You sit down!
- You got it all wrong.

892
01:44:32,243 --> 01:44:35,872
- She's with Dixie.
- Is this seat taken?

893
01:44:36,289 --> 01:44:39,417
- No, sit down and fall in love with me.
- I already did that.

894
01:44:39,834 --> 01:44:43,380
Don't think I'm gonna sit around
while you show her all over town!

895
01:44:44,923 --> 01:44:48,723
- She just came over for a drink!
- Here's five good reasons

896
01:44:48,802 --> 01:44:51,388
why you should fold up your legs
and go home!

897
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:54,173
- Get out of my way!
- You keep out of this!

898
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:58,561
I'm surprised at you.
I thought you got out from under his thumb!

899
01:44:59,521 --> 01:45:02,440
- Pay for that!
- Bitch! - No, you pay for it!

900
01:45:08,697 --> 01:45:12,450
- Did she get her claws on you?
- I'd like to rip her nipples off!

901
01:45:12,909 --> 01:45:17,872
- I'm not afraid of her.
- How's it feel to be the other woman?

902
01:45:18,415 --> 01:45:19,958
How does it feel being the other man?

903
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:25,213
I don't do that anymore.
What's mine is mine, nobody else's.

904
01:45:25,588 --> 01:45:30,927
- What, you out from under him now?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm the Mob Boss now!

905
01:45:33,096 --> 01:45:36,766
- Where are you taking me?
- Some place you've never been.

906
01:46:12,302 --> 01:46:15,930
How'd you get out so fast, so easy?

907
01:46:16,473 --> 01:46:19,809
- Movie star. You got it all.
- Me? What about you?

908
01:46:20,268 --> 01:46:23,396
You're this famous celebrity,
you got your own club.

909
01:46:23,897 --> 01:46:27,651
- You're not even 20 yet!
- Look what I had to do to get it.

910
01:46:30,487 --> 01:46:34,616
- You could have come with me.
- I can't go anyplace on a shoestring.

911
01:46:35,033 --> 01:46:38,161
I've been making
my own way since I was 13.

912
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:41,289
Money's
the only thing that ever saves you.

913
01:46:41,748 --> 01:46:43,249
Hey, you're wrong.

914
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:49,130
Money was the only thing that ever
saved me. Money and my looks.

915
01:46:50,382 --> 01:46:53,385
I was born looking 18.

916
01:46:53,843 --> 01:46:57,472
- I can save you.
- No, you can't.

917
01:46:58,098 --> 01:47:00,392
- Try me.
- You can't.

918
01:47:01,601 --> 01:47:05,605
You don't know what it's like
being his slave. He's everywhere.

919
01:47:06,022 --> 01:47:11,236
- I can't even breathe in my own club.
- You go on in about two minutes!

920
01:47:11,653 --> 01:47:14,155
- The Dutchman is looking for the lady.
- See?

921
01:47:17,367 --> 01:47:19,577
It was great while it lasted.

922
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:02,954
The Dutchman's really ticked off.
She'd better get back.

923
01:48:07,834 --> 01:48:10,837
Good evening
and welcome to the Cotton Club!

924
01:48:12,839 --> 01:48:19,095
What a night it is! What a crowd!
It's Celebrity Night this evening.

925
01:48:19,512 --> 01:48:21,056
And the stars come out.

926
01:48:21,514 --> 01:48:24,559
We have Charlie Chaplin!

927
01:48:24,934 --> 01:48:26,102
Fannie Brice!

928
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:31,191
And James Cagney!

929
01:48:35,153 --> 01:48:40,367
And the man who's become
America's newest screen idol.

930
01:48:40,909 --> 01:48:42,911
Starring in the new hit movie,

931
01:48:43,286 --> 01:48:45,372
"Mob Boss!"

932
01:48:46,623 --> 01:48:50,669
He's the best white musician
ever to sit in with our orchestra.

933
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:54,255
So give a warm round of applause
for Harlem's own...

934
01:48:54,631 --> 01:48:56,341
...Dixie Dwyer!

935
01:49:11,856 --> 01:49:14,901
You okay? Lay off the crap, come on!

936
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,876
You want me to take Vera home?

937
01:49:36,548 --> 01:49:40,510
- I'll take care of Vera.
- Lay off that crap!

938
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,814
The "Mob Boss".
That punk is a real marshmallow.

939
01:49:57,736 --> 01:50:00,363
- All he ever did was copy my style.
- Your style?

940
01:50:00,864 --> 01:50:03,783
Yeah. - You got
as much style as a bowl of turnips.

941
01:50:04,326 --> 01:50:07,662
- Shut up and have a drink!
- I don't want a drink.

942
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,667
I said, drink.

943
01:50:13,293 --> 01:50:15,128
Drinkers lie.
I feel like telling the truth.

944
01:50:15,587 --> 01:50:19,299
- Tell the truth about what?
- I don't know.

945
01:50:24,304 --> 01:50:27,265
Thanks! I was a little nervous.

946
01:50:27,807 --> 01:50:31,853
- What did you do backstage with him?
- I was kissing him.

947
01:50:33,188 --> 01:50:34,898
Nice sitting in, Dixie.

948
01:50:37,067 --> 01:50:39,903
- Did you ever sleep with him?
- Whenever I got the chance.

949
01:50:41,613 --> 01:50:43,948
And I will again if I get the chance.

950
01:50:44,449 --> 01:50:48,828
Well, you'll never get it.
Who got you this? And this?

951
01:50:49,663 --> 01:50:52,207
- How about that?
- Take your hands off her!

952
01:50:52,874 --> 01:50:56,169
- Don't touch her like that!
- You son of a bitch!

953
01:50:56,544 --> 01:50:59,673
- I'll rip your little balls off.
- Don't get into it, Dixie.

954
01:51:00,215 --> 01:51:02,217
What is it you want, Dutch?

955
01:51:02,592 --> 01:51:06,471
All you ever do is give people grief.
You want to rip out her heart?

956
01:51:06,888 --> 01:51:10,934
Wanna get into everybody's life and
ruin it? Wanna be Genghis Khan?

957
01:51:11,393 --> 01:51:13,561
You turn people's lives to shit!

958
01:51:16,356 --> 01:51:20,860
- How many people can you kill?
- Let's take it outside.

959
01:51:21,361 --> 01:51:24,364
- Not in the club. Come on.
- You...

960
01:51:25,949 --> 01:51:26,992
Let's go!

961
01:51:27,409 --> 01:51:30,120
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- I said let's go!

962
01:51:30,537 --> 01:51:31,579
No.

963
01:51:33,665 --> 01:51:37,127
Crawl back in you rathole.
Leave her alone, Dutch.

964
01:51:37,877 --> 01:51:40,130
"Mob Boss"!

965
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:51,224
Hey, Mob Boss, you got one of these?

966
01:51:51,725 --> 01:51:52,851
You son of a bitch?

967
01:51:53,393 --> 01:51:54,936
You got one of these?

968
01:52:00,275 --> 01:52:03,153
You fuckers! Get your hands off me!

969
01:52:03,611 --> 01:52:07,991
Who do you think you are,
putting your hands on the Dutchman!

970
01:52:08,408 --> 01:52:11,286
Dwyer, you're one dead mick!

971
01:52:13,705 --> 01:52:17,042
Having a ball tonight!

972
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:22,589
What a crowd, what a show!
It's all part of the act!

973
01:52:24,132 --> 01:52:26,009
- Stop pushing me!
- Get 'em out of here!

974
01:52:26,509 --> 01:52:29,054
I'm not leaving here
without my hat and coat!

975
01:52:33,975 --> 01:52:36,144
I'll be right back.

976
01:52:36,561 --> 01:52:40,190
Now the Sandman
is going to do a little number for us!

977
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:43,943
Let's hear it for the Sandman!

978
01:52:45,737 --> 01:52:48,448
You do this to the Dutchman?

979
01:53:41,626 --> 01:53:45,088
I'm gonna grind
that mick into a piece of meat.

980
01:53:45,463 --> 01:53:48,049
Then he won't look so pretty to Vera.

981
01:53:50,802 --> 01:53:55,390
He thinks he's safe
cause he's got Madden to protect him.

982
01:53:56,725 --> 01:53:59,227
I'll teach him how you get protected.

983
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,858
All these goddamn micks!

984
01:54:05,275 --> 01:54:08,737
All of 'em. All of 'em gotta go!

985
01:54:19,998 --> 01:54:24,044
That goddamn Madden's
going back to jail where he belongs.

986
01:54:24,461 --> 01:54:29,591
- And goddamn good riddance!
- Frenchy's the problem, boss.

987
01:54:30,008 --> 01:54:35,305
Yeah, big Frenchy. Fuck him, too.
I'll take 'em all on!

988
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:37,891
Give me some service!

989
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:45,732
Did you see who was sitting
with him tonight? Luciano.

990
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,118
Here, Mike.

991
01:55:09,506 --> 01:55:11,299
Gracias.

992
01:55:28,608 --> 01:55:32,153
Those guineas.
Now they're getting to be a problem.

993
01:55:33,905 --> 01:55:36,908
- Order me the usual.
- Sure, boss.

994
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:40,704
Come over here.
Give him a steak with french fries.

995
01:55:41,246 --> 01:55:44,541
Get me an order of ribs.
26 ribs, not 20. What about you?

996
01:57:25,308 --> 01:57:26,810
I love you, Lila.

997
01:57:37,487 --> 01:57:41,658
I liked your picture. I like it
when the mob boss is good looking.

998
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:44,327
Like Owney Madden there?
Hiya, Owney!

999
01:57:44,869 --> 01:57:47,080
- Hi, kid.
- Come here.

1000
01:57:48,123 --> 01:57:51,584
I ain't gonna be
boss of nothing after next week.

1001
01:57:52,377 --> 01:57:55,380
- You retiring?
- I'm going back to jail.

1002
01:57:55,839 --> 01:58:00,010
It's just a little parole violation.
But it ain't a bad excuse to get out.

1003
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:05,223
There's a lot of ambition
in the numbers racket these days.

1004
01:58:05,598 --> 01:58:10,312
The Irish don't know when to quit.
Some of us, we learn as we go.

1005
01:58:10,979 --> 01:58:13,440
Have a good time, Charlie.

1006
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:16,860
We learn as we go.

1007
01:58:26,995 --> 01:58:30,540
- Goodnight, Dixie.
- I'm catching a train for the coast.

1008
01:58:30,957 --> 01:58:34,544
- Have a good trip.
- You were very brave.

1009
01:58:35,128 --> 01:58:37,631
So often you've been my protector.

1010
01:58:38,673 --> 01:58:41,259
I could make a career out of it.

1011
01:58:43,178 --> 01:58:46,514
It wouldn't work.
He'll never let me go.

1012
01:58:47,307 --> 01:58:49,392
That part of your life is over now.

1013
01:58:54,397 --> 01:58:56,858
I'm going to ask you one more time.

1014
01:58:59,861 --> 01:59:01,029
You wanna come along?

1015
01:59:04,616 --> 01:59:07,661
Do me the biggest favor you ever did.

1016
01:59:08,203 --> 01:59:11,539
Just kiss me on my lips
and don't say anything.

1017
01:59:14,459 --> 01:59:18,129
Keep looking over your shoulder
and maybe we'll see each other again.

1018
01:59:18,505 --> 01:59:22,801
Maybe we'll have a drink.
Maybe we'll make love.

1019
01:59:23,343 --> 01:59:24,886
Maybe...

1020
01:59:28,348 --> 01:59:30,308
Dixie, my very very lover!

1021
01:59:30,725 --> 01:59:32,268
Maybe...

1022
01:59:43,321 --> 01:59:44,698
Bye.

1023
02:00:27,115 --> 02:00:28,700
- Wait.
- What?

1024
02:00:29,075 --> 02:00:31,536
- Did you fix the warden?
- It's done.

1025
02:00:31,911 --> 02:00:34,831
- I bet you didn't get the car?
- Wall to wall.

1026
02:00:35,248 --> 02:00:39,002
What is this? In 3 months you're out
with a nice horse farm in Arkansas.

1027
02:00:39,419 --> 02:00:42,255
- Well, you never know.
- I'll tell you one thing.

1028
02:00:42,672 --> 02:00:47,552
The way we got Sing Sing set up
for you, freedom could be a letdown.

1029
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:05,195
This is for your fantasy!

1030
02:01:21,461 --> 02:01:24,589
- Hey, Monk.
- Give'em hell up there, Owney.

1031
02:01:25,548 --> 02:01:26,883
Come on.

1032
02:01:27,926 --> 02:01:31,137
When you bringing the new
Cotton Club show up to Sing Sing?

1033
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:35,100
- A week from Wednesday.
- Ok. I'll start them on the scenery.

1034
02:01:35,558 --> 02:01:37,310
Come on, fellas.

1035
02:01:39,479 --> 02:01:41,147
What a guy.

1036
02:02:07,424 --> 02:02:11,303
Now try and save
some money in Hollywood, Michael.

1037
02:02:12,637 --> 02:02:16,057
- Yeah, go on, go, go.
- Go on, don't miss your train.

1038
02:02:16,516 --> 02:02:18,893
Yeah, I'm going.

1039
02:02:22,355 --> 02:02:25,608
- Here, buy a new coat.
- Goodbye, son.

1040
02:02:25,984 --> 02:02:29,321
Here, you're moving
your arms too much. Let me show you.

1041
02:02:30,363 --> 02:02:31,740
Try it.

1042
02:02:32,699 --> 02:02:33,908
Now you've got it.

1043
02:02:48,298 --> 02:02:50,175
- Come here, doll!
- Dixie, I'm free!

1044
02:02:50,675 --> 02:02:53,303
No, the mob boss has got you now!

1045
02:02:58,933 --> 02:03:01,269
All aboard.

1046
02:03:08,652 --> 02:03:11,279
Drink to a happy ending, Vera Cicero!

1047
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,500
