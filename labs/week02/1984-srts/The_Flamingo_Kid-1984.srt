1
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,238
Forty-eight lifeguards...

2
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,907
seeking a $17-a-week
pay raise...

3
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,917
have walked out sick today...

4
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,749
to protest the city's offer
of only $11...

5
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,755
on what is traditionally...

6
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,984
one of the busiest beach days
of the year.

7
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:40,731
Seventy-seven WABC,
New York radio

8
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:41,891
Hey, Reggie!

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,901
Let's go down to Chinatown
and buy some firecrackers.

10
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:47,871
Jerome! Jerome, don't get dirty!

11
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,567
Mister.

12
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,577
Mister, are you dead?

13
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:54,579
We're going to
Aunt Vivy's wedding.

14
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:55,739
You hear me?

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,111
How many times
have I told you kids...

16
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,446
not to play
in front of the store!

17
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:59,609
Get out of here with that ball!

18
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,482
Let's go, Frankie, put it over.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,216
Billy, get out of the street!
You want to get hit by a car?

20
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,483
How many times I gotta tell ya?

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,891
Get off the roof!

22
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:11,327
Rosie, don't run.
You'll catch pneumonia.

23
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,995
Hello there, everybody.

24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,700
This is Mel Allen speaking
to you from Yankee Stadium...

25
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,837
and welcoming you to what
should be some double-header...

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,938
between the Chicago White Sox
and the New York Yankees.

27
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:32,472
This is the first game
of the double-header...

28
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,779
So, you guys gonna be working
at the supermarket this summer?

29
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,517
Yeah. Yeah, this summer.

30
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,924
My father's got me a job.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,427
As an office boy, you know.

32
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,520
So I'll be working in an office.

33
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,556
Yeah. Nice.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,465
Four and a half games back...

35
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,868
Bobby Thompson,
Bobby Thompson!

36
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,701
What's he done lately?

37
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,739
Listen when I talk to you.

38
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,835
You get more like
your father every day.

39
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:04,909
Shelly, I'll see you later.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,247
See you later, Jeffrey.

41
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,711
- Frank, see you later.
- Take it easy.

42
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,687
No one wears underwear
in the summer.

43
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,212
See you later, Jeffrey.

44
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,622
Will you turn down that radio?

45
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:14,886
Who wants to listen
to the Yankees?

46
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,655
Turn it down!

47
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:28,361
Hey, get off of there!

48
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:29,566
I'm really sorry.

49
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,747
How you doing?
Listen, can I borrow your ice?

50
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,910
I wanna wet my...

51
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,817
Sure, sure.

52
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:43,980
What did I tell you?

53
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,182
Didn't I tell you
we'd find him either...

54
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,986
dealing on
the shoeshine stand...

55
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,549
or hanging out on the corner?

56
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:49,890
I know the kid like a book.

57
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,453
- What are you guys doing here?
- Slumming.

58
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,021
We miss the old neighborhood.

59
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:57,626
So what do you got planned
for the Fourth of July, Jeffrey?

60
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,068
Jack off on the stoop?

61
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,704
What, you got better, Hawk?

62
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,265
Yeah. Tell him, Steve.

63
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,335
A hot gin game going
at the El Flamingo Beach Club.

64
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,676
We need a third.

65
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,340
Why do you need me?

66
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:13,579
It's not a question
of need, Jeffrey.

67
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,745
You're our pal from
the old neighborhood.

68
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,379
It'll be like old times.

69
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:19,413
Look, we'll play
a couple of hands...

70
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,357
then you can go swimming,
see the chicks.

71
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,327
It'll be a new experience
for you.

72
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:26,728
You with us, Jeffrey?

73
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,400
Ma, where's my bathing suit?

74
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:31,595
Bottom drawer.

75
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,203
Where are you going?

76
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,934
I'm going to the beach
with my friends.

77
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,180
Hey, Jeffrey, what are these?

78
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,980
These are my father's dog tags.

79
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,078
Oh, yeah. How is your father?

80
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:51,281
He's great.

81
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,295
So, you going to college,
Jeffrey?

82
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,497
My father still wants me
to be an engineer.

83
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,129
How are you guys
doing in school?

84
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,639
Flunked out.

85
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,368
Think I'm gonna try again
next year, though.

86
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,876
He flunked out
of Miami University.

87
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:16,773
How about you, Hawk,
what are you doing?

88
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,806
You going to school?
Are you working?

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,442
Oh, no, no.
I don't have time to work.

90
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,783
I'm doing too well
at the track.

91
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,789
You think I'm dressed all right
for this club?

92
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:34,427
You're gonna be playing gin,
Jeffrey, not modeling.

93
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:39,029
Come on, let's go
to my cabana and change.

94
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,026
Hey, are those the guys
we're playing?

95
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,502
Are you crazy? It costs $500
just to sit down with them.

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,435
You coming to
watch us play, Joyce?

97
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:27,604
After lunch.

98
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:28,771
When's lunch?

99
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,075
As soon as daddy takes a break.

100
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:32,840
It's all right. I got a minute.

101
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,249
The guys will wait.

102
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:35,980
I'm allowed to talk
to my girlfriend.

103
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,090
You feeling all right?

104
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,959
Oh, yeah. I feel great.

105
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:47,157
Really, I feel good.

106
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,531
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

107
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,904
What? No, I don't have to go...

108
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:55,496
Do I look like I have
to go to the bathroom?

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,701
Yeah, you look like you
have to go to the bathroom.

110
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,334
Attention. This is
your colonel speaking.

111
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,277
Just relax. Take it easy.

112
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,837
Our free dance class
is starting on the patio.

113
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,812
- Hi, Joyce. Hello, Steve.
- Hi.

114
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:08,910
Carla.

115
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,079
That's lunch?
A bunch of lettuce?

116
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:11,645
Well, the chef fixed
these special salads...

117
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,917
for Aunt Phyllis and me.

118
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,822
She actually talks to the chef.

119
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,054
Well, that's because you
New Yorkers eat such garbage.

120
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:18,892
That's because we don't know
what else to do with it.

121
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,955
You know, you could use
some greens yourself, Henry.

122
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,125
Hawk.

123
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,724
Let me see the line
down your tongue.

124
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,133
Where?

125
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,830
Right there.

126
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:31,271
Jeffrey, this is Carla Samson.

127
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,742
My cousin from California.

128
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:33,903
Hello.

129
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,140
Hi. What about yours?

130
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,340
Come on, open up.

131
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,145
Let her feel your tongue,
Jeffrey.

132
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,309
Who's been feeding you?

133
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,285
His mother. Three meals a day.

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,686
Well, she's doing
a first-rate job.

135
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,952
- Joyce.
- Mother.

136
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:49,792
Hello, darling.

137
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,692
Oh, all these people.

138
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,027
Mrs. Brody, this is our
friend Jeffrey Willis.

139
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,191
Hello.

140
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,359
How do you do, Mrs...

141
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:59,962
Carla, I can't eat this.

142
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,995
Oh, Shirley!

143
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,473
Today, please.

144
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,539
Throw this away and bring me
a hamburger patty...

145
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:12,709
cottage cheese, fresh,
a scoop of sherbert...

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,980
and iced tea in a wine glass.

147
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,214
You're not writing it down?

148
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,745
I'll remember, Mrs. Brody.

149
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,121
You didn't yesterday.

150
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,085
Who are you, Jeffrey?

151
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,790
He's a card player,
not a member.

152
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:27,957
I see.

153
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,729
And that gives me
Sweet Ginger Brown!

154
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:31,894
What a pigeon.

155
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:33,836
Your father just won
another big hand, Joycie.

156
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,472
He looks happy.

157
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:39,374
Of course he's happy.
He's playing gin.

158
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,900
Now, let's go.

159
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,072
We gotta go. See you later.

160
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:44,479
- Kissy-kissy.
- Nice tan, Mrs. Brody.

161
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:46,540
- Bye, girls.
- Come on, come on.

162
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,484
Alfred's cabana is this way.

163
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,645
What is that?

164
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,018
Sam Sadakis...

165
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,956
the world's leading
manufacturer of doorknobs.

166
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,086
Every hour, he turns
his chair towards the sun.

167
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,460
That's the El Flamingo's
human sundial.

168
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,096
Hey, boys, this is our friend
Jeffrey Willis from Brooklyn.

169
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,194
These are the two
strongest lifeguards...

170
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:07,534
in Long Island.

171
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:11,338
Turk and Dirk.
They're brothers.

172
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,311
Welcome to the El Flamingo,
Jeffrey.

173
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,108
Don't piss in the pool,
Jeffrey.

174
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,647
Finally,
we're going to play gin.

175
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,750
...walks away from home plate...

176
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:25,483
shaking his head after
taking call strike 3.

177
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,753
We're still scoreless
at the end of 41/2 innings...

178
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,158
How old is Joyce's cousin?
The blonde.

179
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,354
Carla.

180
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:34,192
Everybody seems to want Carla.

181
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:35,529
She's too old for you, Jeffrey.

182
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,591
She's a sophomore in college.

183
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,125
Are you winking at me?

184
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,296
No, I'm not winking at you.

185
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,329
It's my contact lens,
you shmuck.

186
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,670
Thinks I'm winking.

187
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:45,809
I'm winking at you.

188
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:46,969
Aw, you...

189
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:48,137
You're a homo, Alfred.

190
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:49,339
You're a weirdo!

191
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,412
Jeffrey, let's go.

192
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,016
In the second game
of the double-header...

193
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,920
scheduled to work for
the White Sox is Juan Pizarro...

194
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,184
seeking his tenth...

195
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,249
Giraffes, camels, monkeys.

196
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,850
Say, you got any more elephants?

197
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:12,226
We're out of elephants.
Come on. I'm waiting.

198
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:15,459
Oh! That's gin.

199
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,795
What do you got, Alfred?

200
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:24,497
That puts us over 4,000.
We win.

201
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,237
It's a holocaust, fellows.

202
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:27,801
We got shut out.

203
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:29,506
I don't like him very much,
Alfred.

204
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:34,109
Ok. We got 4,175
at a penny a point...

205
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,747
and we got 62 boxes
at a nickel a box.

206
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:40,724
And it's on a Schneider,
so the score is doubled.

207
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,157
Let me add this up here...

208
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,490
Jeffrey?

209
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,052
That's 89.70.

210
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:51,626
Divide that 3 ways...
it's $29.90 each.

211
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,102
Correct as usual.

212
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:56,538
Twenty-nine ninety.
You owe us each 29.90.

213
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,543
What's your name again?

214
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:02,443
Jeffrey. Jeffrey Willis.

215
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,514
Nice game, Willis.
Very nice game.

216
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,313
Hey, you guys,
let's go swimming.

217
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,579
Wanna go swimming?

218
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,177
No, I don't wanna go swimming.

219
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:12,781
- I just lost $30! No!
- I can't.

220
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:15,088
I gotta go get the money
from my mother, all right?

221
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:16,354
Yeah, that's all right.

222
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,689
Oh, thank you.

223
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,826
Thank you.

224
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:55,825
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:00,492
Hey, how are you?

226
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,999
Good. Maybe I'll see you
tomorrow, Jeffrey.

227
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,002
Well, that's if you're going
to Brooklyn.

228
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,162
No.

229
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,795
See, I'm not a member here.
I live over in Brooklyn.

230
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,400
Well, maybe I'll see
you some other time.

231
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,908
Fine.

232
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,002
Hey, Carla, do you
wanna meet my mom?

233
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,239
Sure.

234
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,372
Would you make believe
you're my girlfriend?

235
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:18,643
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, Jeffrey.

236
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,117
Bye, Alfred.
Thanks for the animal crackers.

237
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,121
Hey, could you get this car
out of here?

238
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,850
lt'll just be 1 second.

239
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,187
Donny, move this Cadillac.

240
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:29,055
I've tried. It stalled.

241
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,458
It's going to be
a few minutes, Jeffrey.

242
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,758
Somebody buried our car
in the attendants' pool.

243
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,765
Steve, listen, if you
ever need a third player...

244
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,289
I'd like to come out
and play again.

245
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,700
I'd really like that.
I had a good time.

246
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,136
It's expensive for guests,
though, you know?

247
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,537
Come on! I want to get started!

248
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:46,877
I can't believe
this is happening.

249
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,845
Now we're going to be late
for the track.

250
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:51,911
Maybe I can help.
What's the problem?

251
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,439
The problem is,
we got a car that won't work.

252
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,678
See what you can do, Fortune.

253
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,018
Donny, go get
the Studebaker Lark, OK?

254
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,784
You got a loose
radiator clamp here.

255
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,655
Hey, why don't you go around
and get ready to start it...

256
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,852
and let me...

257
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,558
We all went out to California.

258
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:09,862
We took Aunt lphigenia
with us, and...

259
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,094
Carla?

260
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,500
And we got on...

261
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,632
Tell me when.

262
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:19,199
All right. Kick it over once.

263
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,843
Yeah!

264
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,506
Good job! Thank you.

265
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,606
All right.

266
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,617
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

267
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,777
Oh, sure. Anytime, ma'am.

268
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,047
You're such a smart boy!

269
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,419
Well, not really.
It's very simple, actually.

270
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:34,014
Oh, really? Thank you so much.

271
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,355
Ok. Anytime.

272
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,519
Hey, kid, come over here.

273
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,494
I want to talk to you.

274
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,463
You want a job here this summer?

275
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,398
Well, I don't know.

276
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:43,559
Can I think about that?

277
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,932
No. I just fired a kid.

278
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,163
I need somebody right now.

279
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:47,329
Do you want this job?

280
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,998
Yeah. Yes.

281
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,632
I don't know.

282
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:51,800
Say yes, Jeffrey.

283
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:53,810
- All right. I'll take it.
- Ok! You got it!

284
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:55,778
Now, look. This is car 68.

285
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,247
It's in the west section.
Go get it.

286
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,080
Carla, when I look at you...

287
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,514
I think about
comic book heroines...

288
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,682
like Wonder Woman...

289
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:10,956
with her little tiny waist
and her big, beautiful... eyes...

290
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:15,227
and her tiny little winged feet
and her little diadem...

291
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,200
Alfred, you're revolting.

292
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,724
White Fairlane. Go!

293
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,864
It's deep. Three deep. Go!

294
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,276
If you ever drive my car
like that again, I'll sue you!

295
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,442
Now, you promised
to help me with my nails.

296
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:31,607
Her silky cape...

297
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:34,641
Oh, stop. Come on.
He's revolting, but rich.

298
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,653
It's time for fireworks.

299
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,621
Everybody to the beach.

300
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,819
Fireworks are
for El Flamingo members only.

301
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,089
Nonmembers,
please don't look up.

302
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,190
Just kidding.

303
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,208
Breakfast is ready.

304
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,279
Morning, sweetheart.

305
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,611
Jeffrey, you there?

306
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,639
Just look in the box and give me
the Stilson wrench...

307
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:07,912
will you, please?

308
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:09,886
Which one, do you want
the 14 or the 18?

309
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,353
The 14. I got the 18.

310
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,452
Good morning.

311
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,620
Morning.

312
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,787
All right.

313
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,956
Do you have a union card?

314
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,489
I don't speak English.
I don't know anything.

315
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,764
I come but I don't know...

316
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,270
Hold that. That's it.
Straighten that out.

317
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:29,465
Like that. That's good.

318
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,633
Who taught you how to do this?

319
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,107
Some bum.

320
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:33,440
I'll give you bum.

321
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,001
What are you gonna do?

322
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:38,606
Lend Jack some money
and help him find a job.

323
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:39,775
Arthur.

324
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,285
He is my brother, Ruth.

325
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,752
Jack is my brother.

326
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,354
Bless us, O Lord,
for these thy gifts...

327
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:51,793
which we are about to receive...

328
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:54,059
through Jesus Christ Our Lord.
Amen.

329
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,861
Amen.

330
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,060
Pass the buns.

331
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:01,731
So where were you
until 2:00 in the morning?

332
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:02,932
I was at the beach.

333
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:08,471
Beaches are open
until 2:00 in the morning?

334
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:10,605
The El Flamingo had a dance.

335
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,575
Eating singer.

336
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,273
Will you guys stop?

337
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:44,804
You've been singing and eating
since you were two.

338
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,338
You sound like a subway car.

339
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,984
What's the El Flamingo?
What's that?

340
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:52,648
It's a fancy beach club.

341
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,158
A lot of our
old neighbors belong.

342
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,183
- Dancing and everything?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:58,991
I was a good dancer.

344
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,361
You're laughing.
I danced like a top.

345
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,593
Don't laugh. He was terrific.

346
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,561
I got a job.

347
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,729
Yeah, with Mr. Henderson.

348
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,930
You must be getting excited.

349
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,073
Well, I'm not going
to be working...

350
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,600
at Mr. Henderson's office.

351
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,279
I got a job at the El Flamingo.

352
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,515
Dancing?

353
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,713
No, not dancing.
Parking cars in the lots.

354
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,626
You're working at...

355
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,652
Mr. Henderson's
engineering office this summer.

356
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:34,288
Well, I don't think so.

357
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:37,357
I asked a favor of
Mr. Henderson to do this.

358
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:43,233
An office boy is a good job
in his firm.

359
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,299
It's the ground floor
to an engineer.

360
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,468
But it's the summer, Dad...

361
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,705
and I don't want to be
working in an office.

362
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:53,774
Listen, besides,
the pay is so much better here.

363
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:56,678
How much do they pay?

364
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,846
You mean wages?

365
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,947
No, box tops.
Of course wages. What else?

366
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,685
There's tips. I get tips.

367
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:03,625
I don't believe in tips.
Tips I don't believe in.

368
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,488
Well, I like parking cars.

369
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:09,658
Well, you can park our car...

370
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,167
and still work
with Mr. Henderson.

371
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,327
I mean, what... what is this?

372
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,303
Did you know about this?
What's this? We agreed on...

373
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,796
Arthur, maybe you should
have a word with his boss.

374
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,173
Just take a swing out
to Rockaway after work...

375
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,041
Wait a minute.

376
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,205
No swing outs.

377
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,647
Please, no swing outs
to Rockaway.

378
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,446
I'll be bringing home money
every week.

379
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:31,818
Look, there. Forty dollars.
That's just one night.

380
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,652
I'll be able to help pay
for my tuition.

381
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,885
What about Mr. Henderson?

382
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,222
Oh, come on, dad. Let's face it.

383
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,060
They only hired me because you
fix their plumbing.

384
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:41,394
They don't need me.

385
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,831
I did this on my own.

386
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,967
I got to get ready
to go to work.

387
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:54,505
He gave you $40.

388
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,080
I'm going to practice.

389
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,913
Forty dollars for parking cars.

390
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,087
Eighteen years old.

391
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,795
Hey, what's the matter
with your arm?

392
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:15,958
Nothing's wrong with my arm.

393
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,864
I'm just developing my left
for college ball.

394
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:24,267
Not a bad left hand.

395
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,798
Well, you know, I'm a lefty.

396
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:26,969
Oh.

397
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,637
Hey, I made some good tips
here last night.

398
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,146
Is it like that all the time?

399
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,512
Usually, I guess.
But I just started.

400
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,153
See, if I have a good summer...

401
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:42,158
this parking lot's gonna pay
my room and board to college.

402
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,523
And this ball here...

403
00:21:45,462 --> 00:21:46,952
it's gonna pay the tuition.

404
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,828
I got a scholarship.

405
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,163
Where are you going?

406
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,565
Notre Dame.

407
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,728
That's a good school.

408
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,499
Can't you see it?
"He's at the line."

409
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:56,867
"The crowd hushes."

410
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:04,211
"Fortune Smith
of the Fighting Irish."

411
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:09,245
Wait a second.

412
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:14,251
Jeffrey, Fortune, go see Alfred.

413
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,691
He always welcomes new staff
to the club.

414
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:17,887
Better get going.

415
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:20,893
Pretty nice guy, that Freddie.

416
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:22,091
Swish!

417
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:33,238
Is it necessary
for us to jump, Alfred?

418
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:34,574
Yes, it is.

419
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,203
You see, as new staff...

420
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,476
you must go through
formal initiation.

421
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,452
Excuse me.
Could you play with that later?

422
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,252
You jump off the cabana railing
and catch a wave. Simple.

423
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,087
Of course,
if you miss the wave...

424
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,457
you land in the sand. Splat!

425
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,724
I always like a good splat.

426
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:56,164
This is a very old
El Flamingo tradition.

427
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,134
Let's go, pencil-necks.

428
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,760
Jump.

429
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:00,963
We better get going.

430
00:23:05,576 --> 00:23:07,635
Did you ever see
"The Defiant Ones"?

431
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,238
No, and I don't think
we have time.

432
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,081
Why don't you go first
and break my fall?

433
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,512
Maybe next time.

434
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:19,021
One...

435
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,250
two...

436
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,450
three!

437
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,389
Shit.

438
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,589
No splat.

439
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,236
- Piece of cake.
- Yeah!

440
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,501
Ok. Let's go.

441
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,940
Now you can play
with the whistle.

442
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:23,085
Jeffrey, it's awfully nice
of you to carry that...

443
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,417
to the car for me.

444
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:25,887
Any time, Mrs. Unger.

445
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,322
Oh, look. There's Mr. Getzer.

446
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,188
I'd like to go say hello.

447
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:31,694
He just got divorced.
Wait for me, will you?

448
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:32,854
All right. I'll be over here.

449
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,056
Ok.

450
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:36,258
What's new, fellas?

451
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,597
Hey, Jeffrey!

452
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:39,397
Keep your hands off the popcorn!

453
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,596
Ok.

454
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,403
Who's the guy in the pink shirt?

455
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,874
That's Paul Hirsch,
number 1 cabana boy.

456
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,501
Makes 2 bills weekly.

457
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,372
Mr. Brody's playing
Colonel Easton.

458
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,541
He owns the club.

459
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,107
He's a retired
Air Force colonel.

460
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,984
Brought down 5 planes.
Four of 'em were ours.

461
00:24:58,422 --> 00:24:59,946
See that fat guy over there?

462
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,981
Big Sid, the watcher.
That's all he does.

463
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:03,822
He watches these guys play gin.

464
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,055
That's Charlie Cooper...

465
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:07,757
Olympic cough champion.

466
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:10,529
The striped shirt's
Mario Manetta.

467
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,865
Swallowed a bug last summer.

468
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:14,871
He sells used furniture.

469
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:17,430
All summer they play
Mr. Brody's team.

470
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,567
All summer they lose.

471
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:25,376
The upside-down fan
is Phil Brody, the King.

472
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,112
The guy's a genius, a master.

473
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,312
Really.

474
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:47,363
Excuse me.

475
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,169
Today, Colonel.
Pull a card today, will you?

476
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,034
- That's it?
- That's it.

477
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,011
- You throwing the 10?
- I'm throwing the 10.

478
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,243
You're giving me the 10.

479
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,944
I'm giving you the 10.
Take it!

480
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:14,393
Sweet Ginger Brown.

481
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:17,056
Shit. Thirty points.

482
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,864
How's he do it all the time?

483
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,063
Thirty.

484
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,100
Sweet Ginger Brown.

485
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,541
That man is amazing.

486
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:28,009
He's the king.

487
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,809
Phil Brody is the king.

488
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,712
You play cards like that,
I don't have to see.

489
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:35,684
You know, Phil,
I love a humble winner.

490
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,311
The up-card pile couldn't
have been more than 5.

491
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:38,651
He got gin like that.

492
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,247
I could do that.

493
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,985
Get outta here, will ya?

494
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,583
If I had you in the Air Force...

495
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:45,521
What a pigeon.

496
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,393
He does it to me all the time.

497
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:50,432
Dr. Ward, a 55-year old...

498
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,935
Must you play the radio so loud?

499
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:57,296
Hey, Dad, look at this.

500
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,237
Wait, wait. Let me do it right.

501
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,439
- All right.
- Ok.

502
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,640
Look at that.

503
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:08,344
That's an upside-down fan.

504
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:09,852
That's very nice.

505
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,012
Needs a little work.

506
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:13,045
Why aren't you out
playing ball or something?

507
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,318
I don't want to play basketball.

508
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,893
Come on, Bridget.
One time, for the kid.

509
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,762
Hey, Jeffrey!

510
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,959
Hi, Pauly.

511
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,127
How are you?

512
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,763
All the guys, we're working down
at the supermarket, you know?

513
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,170
We're wondering what's
happening to you.

514
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:32,869
I tell you, I got a job working
at this beach club parking cars.

515
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:34,308
I'm making a lot of money.

516
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:35,572
Oh, my God!

517
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,877
Shel, what's the matter
with that girl?

518
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:39,905
Nothing. She does that stuff
all the time.

519
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,885
Hey, Jeffrey. Meet Bridget.
Bridget, meet Jeffrey.

520
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:44,716
- How do you do?
- Fine. How are you?

521
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:45,881
Nice to meet you.

522
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:47,583
Same here.

523
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,353
All the stock boys
are after her.

524
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:51,257
Well, I can see why.

525
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,524
Hey, listen,
you gotta come down and visit.

526
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:54,689
All right.

527
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:55,857
I'm working over
in the dairy department now.

528
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,298
- Ok, Shelly.
- Everything's going real nice.

529
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:58,494
Great. I'll be down.

530
00:27:58,535 --> 00:27:59,729
- See you later.
- I'll come visit you. I promise.

531
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,101
All right. Bye-bye!

532
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:04,469
Jeez, get me out of here.

533
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:13,540
Toro! Toro!

534
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,086
Willis! Leave me alone!

535
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:35,427
The girl that looks like a
Barbie doll is driving me crazy.

536
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,167
Who, Carla?
Yeah, she asked me out.

537
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:39,175
I didn't want to go out
with her. She's too tall.

538
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,335
Heard all about it.

539
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:41,901
Hey, Jeffrey and Steve,
see you later.

540
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:43,071
See you later, fellas.

541
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:44,705
- Yeah, bye, Jeffrey.
- Thanks for the money, Alfred.

542
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:45,874
Go park a car, Jeff.

543
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,508
Look, forget him.

544
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,882
You wanna win some
of your money back, Alfred?

545
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,511
What do you say
we go to the track?

546
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:55,523
Steven, I've been
looking all over for you.

547
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,685
Really?

548
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,387
No, not really, Steven.

549
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:00,521
The cook is making
Beef Wellington tomorrow night.

550
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:01,690
You'll come for dinner?

551
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,255
Oh, it'd be my pleasure,
Mrs. Brody.

552
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,426
Good.

553
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,729
And I'll be dessert.

554
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,203
Carla, darling, you like
Beef Wellington, don't you?

555
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,398
Oh, yeah.

556
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:11,740
How are you, Mrs. Brody?

557
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,111
Lovely day, isn't it?

558
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:18,944
Oh, beautiful.

559
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:20,210
Jeffrey.

560
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,075
Well, I got to get back to work.

561
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:25,549
I'll see you later, Carla.

562
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:28,114
Jeffrey, could you
get off tomorrow night?

563
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:29,591
Tomorrow night?
Jeez, I don't know.

564
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,856
What... what is tomorrow?

565
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,556
Monday night's
pretty slow, Jeff.

566
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,431
I'd like to invite you
to our house for dinner.

567
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,661
- You would?
- You would?

568
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:40,033
Yeah.

569
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,062
Oh, I'd be delighted.
What time?

570
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,334
8:00.

571
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,569
Hey, that's great.
It's like a double date.

572
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,570
Yeah.

573
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:51,075
All right. I got to go to work.

574
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:53,105
8:00. Dinner.

575
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:54,275
I'll see you later, Carla.

576
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:55,443
Bye.

577
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,510
Come on, let's go for a swim.

578
00:29:57,554 --> 00:29:58,851
You know, he's really cute
and everything...

579
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:01,050
but did you have to invite
him to dinner?

580
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,457
Isn't that the boy
from the parking lot?

581
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,825
That's right.
Jeffrey's a friend of mine.

582
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:07,261
From the parking lot.

583
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,245
This is it.

584
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,976
Steve, how many families
live here?

585
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:27,278
Just the Brodys.

586
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:40,025
Stevie! Where you been?

587
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:41,189
Hi, Lizzie. How you doing?

588
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,357
Oh, fine.

589
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,458
Good. This is my friend
Jeffrey Willis.

590
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,798
- Hi, Jeffrey.
- Pleasure meeting you.

591
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,735
Why are you sweating so about?

592
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,238
Am I sweaty?

593
00:30:49,272 --> 00:30:50,534
Well, come on in.

594
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:52,632
Don't stand there
like mosquito bait.

595
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,670
Thanks.

596
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,679
Mr. Brody's probably in the den.

597
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:15,190
I didn't kill my brother.

598
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,960
It was an accident.

599
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:21,367
Hello. I'm Mister Ed.

600
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:28,806
Mr. Brody.

601
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,107
Oh, come on in, guys.

602
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:31,977
Come on in.

603
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,949
It's nice to see you,
Mr. Brody.

604
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:35,645
Steve, you've been coming
around a long time now.

605
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,619
It's time to stop
calling me Mr. Brody.

606
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,178
Call me Phil. All right?

607
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,348
That's Phil. Yeah.

608
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,823
Phil, this is my friend
Jeffrey Willis.

609
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,723
Glad to meet you, Jeff.
You're a friend of Carla's?

610
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,886
Yes.

611
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:46,054
Good. Sit down. Sit down.

612
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:47,427
I got something here
I want to show you.

613
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:48,954
It's a new thing.
Just come out with this gimmick.

614
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,466
Look. Watch this. Look at this.

615
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:53,666
Got a commercial?

616
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,863
Zap!

617
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:58,704
So she says, "Where will I go
and how long will I stay?"

618
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,403
Zap.

619
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:01,808
Cowboys and indians.

620
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,909
- It's not bad.
- That's great.

621
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:08,645
This is the best part.
I can turn off the sound.

622
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,050
Zap.

623
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,383
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

624
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:13,048
You want something cold?
A beer?

625
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,215
Yeah. Beer sounds good.

626
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,521
Good. Two Lowenbrau coming up.

627
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,890
Have you got a Heineken?

628
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,688
I got a Lowenbrau.

629
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,890
Miller or something?

630
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,426
I got Lowenbrau.

631
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,431
Where's Joyce?

632
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:32,202
Oh, she's upstairs.
She's still arranging herself.

633
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,402
I don't think she
can arrange herself...

634
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,308
any better than she already is.

635
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,805
Steve, why don't you run up
and tell the girls...

636
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:39,974
I'm getting hungry.

637
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:41,176
Oh, sure thing.

638
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,244
Where are they,
Joyce's room down at the end?

639
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,657
I'll find them... Phil.

640
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,191
I've seen you
somewhere before, haven't I?

641
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:57,290
I'm a parking attendant
at the club.

642
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,995
Right. That's it.
You parked my car.

643
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,333
That's it. Yeah, yeah.

644
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,633
Here's your Lowenbrau.

645
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,401
Thanks.

646
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,671
Lowenbrau's a good beer,
isn't it?

647
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,802
I've also seen you
around the game, haven't I?

648
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:10,005
Oh, yes, sir.

649
00:33:11,848 --> 00:33:14,612
Yeah. I like to...

650
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,811
I like it there.

651
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:18,112
You like cards?

652
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:21,715
Oh, I love cards. I really do.

653
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,885
Gin, gin rummy's my game.

654
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:27,756
You're the best player
I've ever seen, Mr. Brody.

655
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,822
You must be psychic.

656
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:31,458
Relax, kid. Relax.

657
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,128
You won't get
any gratuities here.

658
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,604
I know a lot about cards.

659
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,799
But who am I going
to teach it to...

660
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,103
my daughter Joyce?

661
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:45,305
See, it's all right.
You go for gin. That's fine.

662
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:46,542
But you're greedy.
That's your problem.

663
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,244
You gotta leave
yourself a back door.

664
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:50,252
Otherwise, you're gonna be
caught with your pants down...

665
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:51,981
- Uncle Phil?
- Yeah?

666
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:53,682
- Dinner's ready.
- Thanks, Carla.

667
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:55,554
Yeah, that's nice. Thanks.

668
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:56,820
Come on, let's go eat.

669
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,521
We'll talk about this
after dinner.

670
00:33:58,561 --> 00:33:59,687
You're a very good card player.

671
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:00,855
Thank you.

672
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,728
Yeah. You surprised me,
you son of a gun.

673
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:05,632
You got a good card sense.
You remember the cards good.

674
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,896
You got to use the facilities?

675
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:08,062
Excuse me?

676
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:09,401
Toilet.
You got to go to the toilet?

677
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:10,633
Yes. Thank you.

678
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,072
Yeah. Toilet.

679
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:13,598
Good player.

680
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:14,769
There you go, Jeff.

681
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,937
Facilities?

682
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,970
Yeah.

683
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,379
Where is everybody?

684
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:20,882
Mother and Steven
are in the garden.

685
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,078
Carla, go get them,
would you? I'm hungry.

686
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,582
Hello, darling.

687
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,350
Where is he?

688
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,413
He's using the facility.

689
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:01,718
I don't know this boy, Phil.

690
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:03,817
He could be doing anything
in there.

691
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,851
What do you think he's doing?
You think he's stealing soap?

692
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,395
Jeffrey?

693
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:15,597
Coming, ma'am.

694
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:46,167
Darling, why don't you
go to Vassar or Smith?

695
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,531
Because I didn't get
accepted there, Mother.

696
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:52,405
Oh. They didn't accept you. Oh.

697
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,706
Besides, I don't want
to go to a girls' school.

698
00:35:56,512 --> 00:36:00,471
I'm going to be going to
Miami-Dade in September. Yeah.

699
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:02,074
I just went to
the University of Miami.

700
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,144
I didn't do so well there.

701
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,179
Oh, that's nice. That's nice.

702
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:09,384
And the year before that,
I went to Fordham.

703
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,552
Fordham, yeah.
You must be a tennis player.

704
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:12,720
Yeah, I am.

705
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,923
You want to play sometime.

706
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,932
You want to play tennis with me?

707
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,228
Have you ever seen me
play tennis?

708
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:19,394
Yeah. I seen you play once.

709
00:36:19,435 --> 00:36:20,561
Very good.

710
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:21,763
I like to play.

711
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,299
Thank you.

712
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:26,501
Aspic, Jeffrey?

713
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:31,475
Mother, I don't really think
Jeffrey knows what aspic is.

714
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:36,009
No, I don't.

715
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,212
It's like Jell-O.

716
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,620
So don't take it, Jeffrey.

717
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,887
I hate aspic.

718
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:46,451
Oh, Phil. Lizzy worked all day
on this dish.

719
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,760
I read it to her
from the New York Times.

720
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:51,926
Phyllis, I don't want anything
on my plate that moves.

721
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,128
Right, Jeffrey?

722
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:17,552
Jeffrey.

723
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:28,927
You know what
I've been thinking?

724
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:31,405
I've been thinking that it's bad
for our image...

725
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,604
to have a parking lot attendant
in our house.

726
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:35,804
Uncle Phil.

727
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:37,540
It's only just this once.

728
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,013
No, no.

729
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,074
Does cabana boy sound better?

730
00:37:43,353 --> 00:37:44,980
Cabana boy?

731
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:46,181
Oh, you like that.

732
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,649
Well, Mr. Brody,
I'd give my right arm.

733
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,388
You know Colonel Easton?

734
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:55,420
Of course. He owns...
he owns the El Flamingo.

735
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:57,831
After dinner, I'm going
to give him a phone call.

736
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,267
He's into me for a lot of money.

737
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:02,271
Daddy's part-owner of the club.

738
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,671
This summer, I'm gonna win
the rest of it.

739
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:12,581
Look, Carla, I hope I didn't
embarrass you in there.

740
00:38:12,615 --> 00:38:15,209
Why? You were just being
yourself, Jeffrey.

741
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,946
I like it.

742
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:18,317
Frankly, I think they should
have made you...

743
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:20,049
feel a little more
comfortable in there.

744
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,353
Well, your uncle made me
feel comfortable.

745
00:38:22,392 --> 00:38:23,723
He's a nice man.

746
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:26,556
I'm really glad that I met him.

747
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:30,091
I guess he's all right.

748
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:32,658
Joyce, you're hurting me!

749
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,636
Oh, come on. Firm up!

750
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:39,672
Those are big goldfish.

751
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:40,971
They're koi.

752
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,240
You know, Japanese carp.

753
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,610
You ever have one of those days
when you feel...

754
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:47,309
like everything you say
is wrong?

755
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,476
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

756
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:51,612
You know... maybe I shouldn't
have had you here tonight.

757
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:56,091
No! I'm glad that I came.

758
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,820
I wanted to get to know you.

759
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,094
Joyce, I think I broke a tooth.

760
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,842
So I call it the Flamingo...

761
00:39:15,878 --> 00:39:18,403
because the flamingo
is a floppy bird...

762
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:20,006
just like me, you know?

763
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:22,449
Anyway, after the war...

764
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,511
I retired from the Air Force
a full colonel.

765
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:29,218
And my first wife pushes me
to joining an exclusive club.

766
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:31,556
Exclusive!
None of my friends could join.

767
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:32,720
You know what I mean?

768
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:36,698
Anyway, after we split up,
I got this place here.

769
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:39,462
I feel that different people
can make for...

770
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:43,734
a very stimulating relationship
and atmosphere, you know?

771
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:46,401
Here. Jeffrey?

772
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:50,276
Work hard, and you'll put
a lot of change in your pocket.

773
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:53,111
What is that new kid's name?
What's his name? Jason?

774
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:54,377
That's Jeffrey.

775
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,248
Jeffrey. Hey, Jeffrey.

776
00:39:56,285 --> 00:39:57,752
Please, we need you.

777
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,616
Please, Jeffrey, I'm late.

778
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,754
Jeffrey, come on.

779
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:11,590
Where's my drink?
It's a half-hour!

780
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,192
Hurry up, Jeffrey.

781
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,803
Hey, Jeff. Here! Here!

782
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:19,664
Jeffrey!

783
00:40:32,154 --> 00:40:33,416
Black makes you look nice.

784
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,151
Put it away, OK?

785
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:36,419
Family portrait.

786
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:37,585
Try and look happy, dear.

787
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,117
Is everyone smiling?

788
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,629
I want a picture with Jeffrey.
Give us a picture with Jeffrey.

789
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:42,858
Jeffrey, come here.
Take a picture.

790
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,491
Just, come on. That's fine.

791
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:47,094
Right in here. Come in here.
Look at this.

792
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:49,570
I'll be in the cabana, darling.

793
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,539
Nice. Yes. Just me and Jeff.

794
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,701
Wait a minute!
I'll take off the glasses.

795
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,040
I look better
without the glasses.

796
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:59,036
Jeffrey! Over here, Jeffrey!

797
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:23,330
Good evening, Mr. Brody.

798
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,363
I'm just gonna straighten up
your cabana a little bit, OK?

799
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,898
Sure.

800
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,935
That's a nice shirt
you have, Mr. Brody.

801
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:31,469
Thank you, Jeffrey.

802
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:34,210
Appearance is important.

803
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,275
Remember what I'm telling you.

804
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,310
You are what you wear.

805
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:40,817
You know,
I've heard that before.

806
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,790
What is that,
a satin... satin shirt?

807
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:45,157
Satin? This shirt? Satin?

808
00:41:45,194 --> 00:41:46,627
Are you kidding? Satin?

809
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:48,687
Come here. Come here. Satin!

810
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:50,323
Feel that. Feel that.

811
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:52,834
Satin! Silk.

812
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:54,460
Oh, jeez, you know,
I should have known.

813
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:57,438
Chinese silk. You like it?

814
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,940
It's great.

815
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,408
I want you to have it.

816
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:01,569
Oh, Mr. Brody,
you don't have to...

817
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:03,442
Jeffrey, please.
I want you to have it.

818
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,605
All right?

819
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,944
You're going to love this shirt.

820
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,780
I don't have to do it.
I don't have to do anything.

821
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,048
Slide your arm up that sleeve.

822
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:12,486
That's real nice of you,
Mr. Brody.

823
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:13,647
Yeah, that's really nice.

824
00:42:13,689 --> 00:42:14,815
You like that feel?

825
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:15,983
It's a nice shirt.

826
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:17,287
- I got dozens of these shirts.
- Yeah?

827
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,487
Guy in Hong Kong
sends 'em to me.

828
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:20,654
You going to school?

829
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:22,493
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you going?

830
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,556
I'm probably going
to be studying at Columbia.

831
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,227
Good for you! That's great!

832
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:27,895
Did you go to college,
Mr. Brody.

833
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,371
Yeah... Well, I mean, I didn't...

834
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:32,670
You know, I didn't go
to college, but...

835
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,107
My older brother
used all the money...

836
00:42:34,143 --> 00:42:36,008
so there was nothing left
for me.

837
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:38,445
I went to night school.
I graduated, NYU.

838
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,416
Took a lot of business courses.
Let me give you some advice.

839
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,112
You can forget that
literature, religion...

840
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:46,348
music, philosophy,
things like that.

841
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,084
I mean, it's OK, but...

842
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:51,560
what are you going to do
with philosophy?

843
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:55,792
You've never seen a philosopher
making 50 grand a year.

844
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:57,696
You've never seen a philosopher
driving a car like this.

845
00:42:57,733 --> 00:42:59,291
No.

846
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:01,326
Remember what I'm telling you.

847
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,066
Socrates rode around
on the back of a donkey.

848
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:07,874
That's a good one, Mr. Brody.

849
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:10,505
Don't do that, please.

850
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,343
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get out of the car now.

851
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,872
Jeffrey, you like that Maserati?

852
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:16,316
180 miles an hour.

853
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:18,411
You step on that gas,
it's good-bye, everybody.

854
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:19,614
Mr. Brody, he just came...

855
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,213
No, no. Ron, it's all right.
It's a friend of mine.

856
00:43:21,257 --> 00:43:22,622
This is Jeffrey.
Say hello to Ron.

857
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:23,784
Ron, it's a pleasure.

858
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:24,952
Nice to meet you.

859
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:26,291
Ron started working with me...

860
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:27,818
when you were what,
21 years of age?

861
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:29,831
- Right.
- 21 years old.

862
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,059
Now he's got a big house
in Manhasset.

863
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,398
He's got a swimming pool.
He's got a barbecue pit.

864
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,869
But he's never invited me
over for dinner.

865
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,030
It's all right.

866
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,198
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you would want...

867
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,104
It's all right.

868
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:41,405
Go sell a car. Go on.

869
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:50,107
That's proof. It's never
too soon to start with a career.

870
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:51,881
Yeah.

871
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,946
Come on, let's go for a spin.

872
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:55,388
In this?

873
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,982
No. You don't drive this
on the road.

874
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:58,584
It's got no windshield.
You get bugs in your teeth.

875
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:00,686
Oh, yeah. Sure.

876
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,494
You ever hit a bug
going 180 miles an hour?

877
00:44:03,532 --> 00:44:05,557
Believe me, it's not a thrill.

878
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,296
For you or the bug.

879
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:09,099
All I have to do is sell
2 of these every month...

880
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:10,435
covers my whole nut.

881
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,566
- Whole nut?
- Easy.

882
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,270
You know, I watch guys
knocking their brains out.

883
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:16,710
Take my brother Pat.

884
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:18,475
Law review at Michigan.

885
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,573
If he's lucky... lucky!...

886
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,914
he does maybe 20 grand a year.

887
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,388
That's my bar bill at the club.

888
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:29,220
Your bar bill at the club.

889
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:30,885
The point I'm making is...

890
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:34,657
the salesmen of this world
make the money.

891
00:44:34,697 --> 00:44:35,959
Remember that.

892
00:44:35,998 --> 00:44:37,363
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

893
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,765
The reason I'm telling you this
is I've been watching you.

894
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:44,601
You know what I've seen
so far spells?

895
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:47,001
What?

896
00:44:48,344 --> 00:44:49,504
Salesman.

897
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,009
Salesman, huh?

898
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:55,380
You're personable,
you're bright, you're sharp.

899
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:57,351
Yeah?

900
00:44:57,386 --> 00:45:00,412
You're just the kind of
young man I want working for me.

901
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:01,650
Really?

902
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,784
I never kid when I'm talking
about a person's future.

903
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:07,288
Come on, kid. Let it out.

904
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,591
See what this thing will do.

905
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,768
Look what I found in his closet.

906
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:24,370
It's a silk shirt.

907
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:28,640
Looks like some kind of costume.

908
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:32,952
He said somebody at
the club gave it to him.

909
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,148
I wouldn't wear that.

910
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,340
Go, Carla, go.

911
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:01,375
There you are, Mrs. Brody.

912
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,885
Straight vodka on the rocks
in a wine glass.

913
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,910
Is there anything else
you'd like me to get?

914
00:46:05,955 --> 00:46:07,115
A gun.

915
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:10,118
Go!

916
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:15,690
Well, I'll check the snack bar
to see if they have a gun,

917
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,461
but you might have to settle
for a club sandwich.

918
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,990
Cute, Jeffrey, cute.

919
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,138
This is my life...
being amused by a cabana boy.

920
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,568
Ole!

921
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:48,592
Curt, I give you the honor
of working on the perfect body.

922
00:46:50,532 --> 00:46:52,261
And you can also work
on this damn machine.

923
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:55,031
What is that 192? What?
No way I weigh 192.

924
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,594
Are they kidding? 192.

925
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,266
You look good.

926
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:00,434
I try to...
I try to keep in shape.

927
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,575
You know, Jeff, I...

928
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,775
I've been watching your
gin rummy game.

929
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:08,510
Go on. Lay down. Stretch out.

930
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,710
Lay down on my stomach?

931
00:47:09,752 --> 00:47:11,049
On your stomach. That's it.

932
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:12,246
There you go.

933
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:14,950
Yeah.

934
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,150
You know, maybe someday
you and me...

935
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,489
we could sit
on the same side of the table.

936
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,495
Nah, never.

937
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:22,394
The guys you play
against are too good.

938
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,590
They think they're too good.

939
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,465
That's the secret.

940
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,164
Jeffrey, my boy...

941
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:31,570
God put certain people
on this Earth to give you money.

942
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:36,237
And your responsibility in life
is to go out there and take it.

943
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:38,706
Isn't that right, Axel?

944
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:43,518
See, Jeff, I know a lot more
about you than you realize.

945
00:47:43,552 --> 00:47:45,349
I see a young fellow
who was probably raised...

946
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:48,948
by a good, solid family
in Brooklyn.

947
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,653
A hard-working father,
like mine.

948
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:53,628
I loved my father.

949
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,426
He sold notions
down in the garment district.

950
00:47:56,465 --> 00:48:00,026
And if he sold a lot of 1,000...

951
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:03,300
he'd clear maybe $5.00.

952
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,465
Really?

953
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:08,943
I remember one time he was...
you know, kind of discouraged.

954
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,280
And he sat there,
and he looked at me.

955
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:15,049
Do you know what he said to me?

956
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,855
"Phil, how many pounds
of potatoes will I eat...

957
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:22,151
"before I die?"

958
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,764
I don't want to see that
happen to you, Jeffrey.

959
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:33,165
Make sure you come to see me
when you're ready, all right?

960
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:37,169
I will.

961
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,366
Come on.

962
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:40,705
Over we go. On the front.

963
00:48:40,743 --> 00:48:43,678
Over here. Same spot.

964
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:44,872
Get me in the front.

965
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,854
Hi, Dad. Hi, Nikki.

966
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,413
Look what the wind blew in.

967
00:48:58,327 --> 00:48:59,555
Hi, Ma. Anybody call?

968
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:02,086
To what do we owe the pleasure?

969
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:03,758
What brings you home?

970
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:05,164
Oh, they closed the club early.

971
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,462
The rain killed us, so...

972
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:09,938
Jeffrey, do you want gravy
on your potatoes?

973
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:14,635
Dad.

974
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,311
Did you have potatoes tonight?

975
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:20,076
Oh, yes. Boiled.

976
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:22,948
How many potatoes do you think
you'll eat before you die?

977
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:30,347
Jeffrey, do you want potatoes
or not?

978
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,222
Oh, no, thank you, Mom.
I'll just have a little dessert.

979
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,959
I ate dinner already.

980
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:39,763
I got ice cream. Come on.

981
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:42,794
Mom, how come
you never make aspic?

982
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:45,534
Aspic?

983
00:49:45,574 --> 00:49:47,633
You tell him when he comes back,
all right?

984
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:51,271
Jeffrey, can I see you
a moment, please?

985
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:56,610
Tell him now.

986
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:59,485
I was at Columbia today,
filling out my fall courses...

987
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,647
Tell him faster.

988
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:02,554
So I talked to
a professor friend I know...

989
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:05,458
and I got you another interview.

990
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:06,654
For what?

991
00:50:06,695 --> 00:50:08,162
Admissions.

992
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:09,664
Just because you're
on the list at Columbia...

993
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:10,824
doesn't mean you should give up.

994
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:12,800
This interview could move
you right up there.

995
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:15,030
You still want to go
to Columbia, don't you, Jeffrey?

996
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,903
I mean, you don't
want to go to Pratt.

997
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,306
Thank you, Nikki, but I may not
be needing college.

998
00:50:22,544 --> 00:50:23,704
Ok?

999
00:50:28,884 --> 00:50:30,749
You may not be needing college?

1000
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,854
What may you be needing?

1001
00:50:33,889 --> 00:50:35,618
Dad, let's face it.

1002
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,818
The best training for life
is life.

1003
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,589
I'm thinking about
going into sales.

1004
00:50:41,396 --> 00:50:43,694
The cabana boy
is going into sales.

1005
00:50:43,732 --> 00:50:45,097
Look, money's
the name of the game...

1006
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:47,398
and if you can make it easy,
make it easy.

1007
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:49,799
I know this guy.

1008
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,999
He sells only 2
sports cars a month.

1009
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,270
It covers his whole nut.

1010
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,072
- Jeffrey...
- See what I'm saying?

1011
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:59,376
You don't really want
to sell cars, do you?

1012
00:50:59,414 --> 00:51:01,473
You want to go to college,
right?

1013
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,451
Mom. Ma, believe me.

1014
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:05,043
College is overrated.

1015
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,645
Don't let anybody
tell you different.

1016
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:10,717
I know this guy.
He made law review at Michigan.

1017
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:13,023
He's lucky if he brings in
20 grand a year.

1018
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:14,858
Now, you take this
car salesman I know...

1019
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:19,093
that's his bar bill at the club.

1020
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:21,102
What does
this car salesman drink?

1021
00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:22,262
Well, maybe I'm overstating it.

1022
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:24,772
The point I'm trying to make
is it's the businessmen...

1023
00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:26,967
of this world
that make the money.

1024
00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:28,135
You know what I'm saying.

1025
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:29,974
No, I don't.

1026
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:31,877
Who is this person?

1027
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:35,680
Who is this person?
Phil Brody, the King.

1028
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,207
Now he knows kings.

1029
00:51:37,252 --> 00:51:38,947
What the hell
is he talking about?

1030
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:41,114
Phil Brody owns
Brody Motors out in Rockaway.

1031
00:51:41,156 --> 00:51:43,124
He's probably the top mover
of performance cars...

1032
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:45,524
on the whole East Coast.

1033
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,257
He says what he sees in me
spells salesman.

1034
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:50,390
What I see of you spells crap.

1035
00:51:54,303 --> 00:51:56,100
Why do you always
have to put me down?

1036
00:51:56,138 --> 00:51:57,833
Because... Come here.
I'll tell you why.

1037
00:51:57,873 --> 00:51:59,864
You're a kid.
Because you're just a kid.

1038
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,239
You got gook on your shirt.

1039
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:03,540
You got no training.
You can't spell anything yet.

1040
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,069
Arthur! Arthur, please.

1041
00:52:05,113 --> 00:52:08,276
Nikki, play something
so the neighbors don't hear.

1042
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:10,581
No, no. Please stop.
Stop playing. Don't play.

1043
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:17,287
Jeffrey, I may be just
a plumber named Willis...

1044
00:52:17,326 --> 00:52:18,918
but I'm a good plumber.

1045
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,252
I give a dollar's work
for a dollar's pay.

1046
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:28,628
I put in a sleeve,
I cut a joint, it stays.

1047
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:32,935
But still, I have some dreams.

1048
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,501
Now, one of my dreams is one day
I'll build my own boat...

1049
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:38,377
and Ruth and I will
sail off somewhere.

1050
00:52:38,413 --> 00:52:40,574
My other dream is that
my children be educated.

1051
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,140
I don't care what you do.

1052
00:52:42,184 --> 00:52:44,209
Worse comes to worst,
an educated plumber...

1053
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:46,118
which would make you
a better plumber than me.

1054
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:47,280
But be educated.

1055
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:49,256
Now, this... this friend of yours
has some funny ideas.

1056
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,417
This Mr. Brophy...

1057
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,585
Brody.

1058
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,118
Brody!
Everybody knows this guy!

1059
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,857
He's got some funny ideas.

1060
00:52:55,897 --> 00:52:57,865
And I won't have them
in my house.

1061
00:52:57,899 --> 00:52:59,958
This is my house!

1062
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,560
That's my chair,
that's my table...

1063
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:02,934
that's my piano, my binoculars!

1064
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,531
My pictures!
That used to be my dog!

1065
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:06,871
That's my sofa!

1066
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:08,466
I am king here!

1067
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:12,476
Forget the interview, Jeffrey.

1068
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:13,811
Just go to Pratt.

1069
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:14,975
Wrong.

1070
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:16,211
Nikki!

1071
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,811
I've just decided now that
I'm not going to college.

1072
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:20,185
I'm going to be a car salesman.

1073
00:53:20,222 --> 00:53:21,917
- Jeffrey, sit down.
- No!

1074
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:23,481
Look, I'm getting
a little sick and tired...

1075
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:25,550
of you telling me
what I'm supposed to be...

1076
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:26,720
and what I'm supposed to do.

1077
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:28,662
This is my life, OK?

1078
00:53:28,697 --> 00:53:30,597
Let me live it,
and leave me alone.

1079
00:53:37,572 --> 00:53:39,233
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

1080
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:41,640
I have to go home
and get ready for school.

1081
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,837
You know that.

1082
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:47,012
I have some big decisions
I have to make...

1083
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,141
you know, with my family
and everything.

1084
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,982
I told you about that.
You know, my father.

1085
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,113
I told you about him.

1086
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:56,420
You're the only person
around here that I can talk to.

1087
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,688
I can't talk to Hawk,
for crying out loud.

1088
00:53:58,727 --> 00:53:59,853
You know what I mean.

1089
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:01,590
I don't have anybody
that I can really talk to...

1090
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,894
except for you,
and now you're leaving.

1091
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:09,866
You're gonna make
the right decision.

1092
00:54:09,905 --> 00:54:11,998
It's going to be all right.

1093
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,803
Cabana boy!

1094
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:15,332
I better get back to work.

1095
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,806
Well, I have a week left.

1096
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:21,577
Do you want to sulk
or do you want to have fun?

1097
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:23,015
I want to sulk.
I don't mind sulking.

1098
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,416
I like to sulk.

1099
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:28,687
I got to work. I got to make
a human sundial here.

1100
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:32,751
Ok, sulk. If you change
your mind, I'll be around.

1101
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:26,275
There you are, ma'am.

1102
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:28,680
You have a nice behind, Jeffrey.

1103
00:55:28,717 --> 00:55:32,312
All the cabana boys seem
to have the same size behind.

1104
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:35,115
Can I put your tip
in your pocket?

1105
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:36,317
Yeah.

1106
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:40,758
You missed my pocket again,
Mrs. Unger.

1107
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,161
I like to miss it.

1108
00:55:43,865 --> 00:55:45,492
Tell the boys
to bring my car around.

1109
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:48,059
I'll come out after I shower.

1110
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:49,570
Ok, Mrs. Unger.

1111
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,777
Hey, Fortune,
what are you doing tonight?

1112
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,937
I got something hot.

1113
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,104
What? Mrs. Unger?

1114
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,306
No, no, no, no.

1115
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:02,111
Hop in. I'm working,
all right? What's up?

1116
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,345
I got a hot tip on a horse.

1117
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:05,978
You want to go
to the track tonight?

1118
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:07,386
- The track?
- Yeah.

1119
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:09,583
Hawk knows this trainer
who says it's definite.

1120
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:11,421
So it's definite.

1121
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,223
- Inside info?
- Yeah.

1122
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:15,821
I'm not usually privy
to inside information.

1123
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:16,990
I mean, rich people always are.

1124
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:19,398
I guess that's why
they stay rich.

1125
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:21,026
So you in?

1126
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,195
Yeah, I'm in.

1127
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:24,398
Great. We'll pick you up
in front here at 7:30.

1128
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:26,373
I'm going to make you
a rich man, Fortune.

1129
00:56:26,408 --> 00:56:28,103
Like to hear it.

1130
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:35,376
This looks all right.
Where's Jeffrey?

1131
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:37,510
That's what I want to know.

1132
00:56:37,552 --> 00:56:39,349
There's your tailor's wife.

1133
00:56:39,387 --> 00:56:41,321
They must have moved to...

1134
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,482
No wonder you never got
your pants back.

1135
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,049
Ma, ma,
please get down from there.

1136
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:46,993
Shit. My parents are here.

1137
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,960
Listen, we're going home
to get changed, all right?

1138
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:53,559
Don't forget you gotta be here
at 7:30 for the track.

1139
00:56:53,602 --> 00:56:54,728
What track?

1140
00:56:54,769 --> 00:56:56,464
Don't tell everybody
about the track!

1141
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:59,030
My optometrist gave
the tip to me, not...

1142
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:01,338
You have to get
Mrs. Unger's car.

1143
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,207
Hi, Ma.

1144
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:04,735
Hello, Jeffrey. How are you?

1145
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:06,178
- Jeffrey.
- Hello, son.

1146
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,806
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?

1147
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:09,009
Same problem with the car.

1148
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,644
It's the water pump. It's shot.

1149
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:13,620
She still works good, though.

1150
00:57:13,655 --> 00:57:15,646
What are you doing here?

1151
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:19,251
Well, we decided tonight
for a change...

1152
00:57:19,294 --> 00:57:21,990
to go out to dinner together
like a family.

1153
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,793
We're going to go have
macaroni at Giuseppi's.

1154
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:25,595
Wait a minute. I can't go.

1155
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:27,226
I'm sorry. I already made plans.

1156
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:28,964
What plans?

1157
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:32,269
What plans?
I got to go with my friends.

1158
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:33,831
Where are you going?

1159
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,001
I'm going out.
What's the difference?

1160
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:36,169
Where are you going out?

1161
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:38,611
Arthur, I told you we
should have called.

1162
00:57:38,647 --> 00:57:40,080
Where are you going out?
Where are you going?

1163
00:57:40,115 --> 00:57:41,639
I'm going to Yonkers.

1164
00:57:41,683 --> 00:57:44,151
What's in Yonkers?

1165
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:46,411
- There's a race track, Dad.
- What?

1166
00:57:46,454 --> 00:57:48,388
There's a race track.
I'm going with my friends...

1167
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,549
Oh. I see.

1168
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,751
So now going to the race track
with your friends...

1169
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,225
is more important than macaroni
at Giuseppi's?

1170
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,784
Wait a minute.
Mom, did I say that?

1171
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:56,353
You, too. Work on your backhand.

1172
00:57:56,398 --> 00:57:58,298
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm going to die.

1173
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:01,359
Arthur, we can all have
dinner together another time.

1174
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:03,303
Please, don't. You're making me
look like the bad guy.

1175
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:04,464
Now, listen.

1176
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:06,440
You're always doing this to me.
Don't do this to me.

1177
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:08,305
Just let me talk to Jeff.
Jeffrey.

1178
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:11,512
...and I never said...

1179
00:58:11,546 --> 00:58:13,013
Horses. Race track...

1180
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:14,345
How you doing?

1181
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:15,679
Mr. Brody. How are you?

1182
00:58:15,717 --> 00:58:17,685
Am I interrupting
something here?

1183
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:18,981
No, you're not.

1184
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,715
I'd like you to meet my mother.

1185
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:22,950
Mrs. Willis, how are you?

1186
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:24,390
What a pleasure this is.

1187
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:25,552
So nice to meet you.

1188
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:26,720
This is my daughter, Nikki.

1189
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:27,887
Nikki, how are you?

1190
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:29,055
Nikki, say hi to Mr. Brody.

1191
00:58:29,097 --> 00:58:31,088
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1192
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,991
What do you think I am, a moron?

1193
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:35,161
This is my father.

1194
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:36,568
Mr. Willis.

1195
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:38,971
I cannot tell you what
a pleasant surprise this is.

1196
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:40,668
Jeffrey's told me
so much about all of you...

1197
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:42,438
I feel like I know you.

1198
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,377
I feel I know you, too.

1199
00:58:44,412 --> 00:58:46,039
Well, you got a great kid,
here, Mr. Willis.

1200
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:47,412
You got a great kid.

1201
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:49,246
He's bright. He's ambitious.

1202
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:50,808
He's the best cabana boy
at the club.

1203
00:58:50,852 --> 00:58:52,183
- I'm not the best.
- Now, don't be modest.

1204
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,711
He's come a long way
since I met him.

1205
00:58:54,756 --> 00:58:56,018
A great cabana boy.

1206
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:57,490
The best.

1207
00:58:57,525 --> 00:58:59,152
Yeah.

1208
00:58:59,194 --> 00:59:04,131
Jeffrey, about this race track
and gambling and horses...

1209
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,258
why don't we talk about this
over dinner?

1210
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:07,598
Well, I want to be
with my friends.

1211
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:08,796
Look, this is very important...

1212
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,099
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1213
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:12,003
I don't mean to butt in...

1214
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,907
but at his age,
his friends are important.

1215
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,641
Your father's first name?

1216
00:59:21,549 --> 00:59:22,948
Arthur.

1217
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:24,884
Arthur.

1218
00:59:24,919 --> 00:59:27,387
See, Arthur,
boys grow up only once.

1219
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:29,356
Jeffrey works very hard.

1220
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,291
Tonight he wants to go
to the track with his friends.

1221
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:32,793
Let him go.

1222
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:34,158
Stop it.

1223
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,321
Excuse me?

1224
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,456
What are you telling me
about my son?

1225
00:59:37,499 --> 00:59:39,399
How can you tell me
about my son?

1226
00:59:39,434 --> 00:59:42,403
This is my son, not yours.

1227
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:43,563
What are you saying?

1228
00:59:43,605 --> 00:59:46,403
I'm saying that he was going
to go to college, my son...

1229
00:59:46,441 --> 00:59:47,567
before he met you...

1230
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,839
and got these silly ideas
about selling cars...

1231
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,345
is what I'm saying.

1232
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,676
Just wait a minute.

1233
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,874
Ok. Yeah. I just...

1234
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:55,507
Selling cars
is not a silly idea.

1235
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,450
Some of us do very well
selling cars.

1236
00:59:57,485 --> 00:59:59,043
This is unnecessary, please.

1237
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,816
You're right.

1238
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:02,652
What do you do?
What do you do for a trade?

1239
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:03,817
I mean, what do you do
for a living?

1240
01:00:03,858 --> 01:00:05,189
- You work with your hands?
- I'm a plumber.

1241
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,455
Look, Artie...

1242
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,464
Arthur.

1243
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:13,058
Mr. Willis, let me
put it to you this way.

1244
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:16,298
Jeffrey here, your son,
he's a very bright young man.

1245
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:17,463
I know that.

1246
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:20,372
You should open your mind,
listen to what he has to say.

1247
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,705
Look, you seem like
a good father.

1248
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,210
I am a good father.

1249
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,609
He's a very good father.

1250
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:26,944
Listen to your boy.

1251
01:00:26,981 --> 01:00:28,243
Talk to him.

1252
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:29,409
You can work it out,
the two of you.

1253
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:30,577
Work it out together.

1254
01:00:30,618 --> 01:00:33,086
Jeffrey,
your father's a good man.

1255
01:00:34,856 --> 01:00:36,346
Jeff, I'll see you.

1256
01:00:36,391 --> 01:00:38,382
Mrs. Willis, a pleasure.

1257
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,156
Look at this pretty girl.
Nikki. Such a pleasure.

1258
01:00:41,196 --> 01:00:42,686
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1259
01:00:44,332 --> 01:00:45,458
Mr. Brody, I had it washed.

1260
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,764
Here you go, Fortune,
add this to your fortune.

1261
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,162
Nice car.

1262
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:08,784
You coming, Jeffrey?

1263
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:09,983
No.

1264
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:13,286
All right. We're going.
Let's go. Come on.

1265
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:50,289
At the turn, it's
Gussy's Grandson and In A Pinch.

1266
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,390
Opal Sunset moving up
to challenge.

1267
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:54,128
It's Gussy's Grandson,
Nobody's Business...

1268
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,535
and In A Pinch.
Opal Sunset fading fast.

1269
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:57,697
They're in the stretch.

1270
01:01:57,739 --> 01:01:59,366
It's Gussy's Grandson
and In A Pinch.

1271
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:00,840
In A Pinch
and Nobody's Business.

1272
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,775
Nobody's Business. In A Pinch.

1273
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:04,574
Hey, Hawk, did we miss the race?

1274
01:02:04,612 --> 01:02:07,012
No. Our tip is
for the last race.

1275
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,310
Hey, guys,
I'll see you in a minute, OK?

1276
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,511
I gotta go pee, all right?

1277
01:02:13,488 --> 01:02:14,978
Jeff, what was the name
of that sure thing?

1278
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,456
- Arvo Hanover.
- Yeah.

1279
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:17,651
What'd he say?

1280
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:24,892
Arvo Hanover, number 8 horse
to win... 10 times.

1281
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,798
Number 3, Betting Bird.

1282
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:28,097
Number 4, Apple Pie.

1283
01:02:28,136 --> 01:02:29,865
Number 5, White Hill.

1284
01:02:29,904 --> 01:02:31,394
Number 6, Son Of Flasher.

1285
01:02:31,439 --> 01:02:33,168
Number 7, Jack Be Nimble.

1286
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,177
And number 8, Arvo Hanover.

1287
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,408
The 8 horse 10 times, please.

1288
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:41,574
Where the hell is Fortune?
He's gonna miss this!

1289
01:02:41,616 --> 01:02:43,345
We made it! Beautiful!

1290
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,681
Damn it!

1291
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,744
Hey! Where you been?
You didn't get a bet down.

1292
01:02:46,788 --> 01:02:48,779
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

1293
01:02:48,823 --> 01:02:50,154
What are you talking about?

1294
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,955
Fifty-dollar win?

1295
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:54,188
All 10 of them, baby.

1296
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,355
Oh, my God.

1297
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:57,330
Five bills on a horse?

1298
01:02:57,365 --> 01:02:58,491
What are you, nuts?

1299
01:02:58,533 --> 01:02:59,659
That's crazy, Fortune.

1300
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:01,362
I'm not crazy.
You know what that is?

1301
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,029
Eight-to-1 odds, Jeffrey.

1302
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,766
Four thousand dollars, man.

1303
01:03:04,806 --> 01:03:06,501
I'm going to Notre Dame
in style.

1304
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:07,701
And they're off.

1305
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,246
Hawk, there are those guys
who wanted to break your nose.

1306
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:15,544
I ain't afraid of those wimps.

1307
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,915
Hey, look who's here.
The boys from the El Flamingo.

1308
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:19,112
Hi, guys.

1309
01:03:23,725 --> 01:03:25,317
Number 8 is great!

1310
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,689
Hey, you're blocking my view.

1311
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,560
Hey, come on, get your big nose
out of here.

1312
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,962
You're hogging my oxygen.

1313
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:46,203
Arvo Hanover third,
moving up to challenge.

1314
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,511
Arvo Hanover taking the lead.

1315
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:51,347
Freedom Call second.
Nelson Ride third.

1316
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:52,512
Get him!

1317
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:53,815
Come on!

1318
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,618
Oh, no!
There goes my contact lens.

1319
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:56,783
Wait!

1320
01:03:56,824 --> 01:03:58,223
Arvo Hanover pulling out
in front.

1321
01:03:58,259 --> 01:03:59,590
Freedom Call behind by a head.

1322
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,187
Why me, always me?

1323
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:04,061
Arvo Hanover by a 1/2 a length.

1324
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,600
Arvo Hanover breaks stride.

1325
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,762
Oh, shit!

1326
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,135
What happened?
She's going backwards!

1327
01:04:11,172 --> 01:04:12,434
She broke stride.

1328
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,464
She has to go to the rear
of the pack.

1329
01:04:22,383 --> 01:04:23,509
I knew it!

1330
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,179
I knew that if we'd listened
to Hawk, we'd lose.

1331
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,778
I can't believe she broke.

1332
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,552
I smelled victory.

1333
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:31,785
It's my optometrist.

1334
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,350
He's out 500 bucks now.

1335
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:36,625
Oh, God, why me?
Why me, Jeffrey?

1336
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,529
...please drive safely
on your way home.

1337
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:42,229
Those guys from the El Flamingo
always bring me bad luck.

1338
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:44,329
Let's welcome them to Yonkers.

1339
01:04:52,146 --> 01:04:53,272
Jeffrey, I'm sorry.

1340
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:54,941
I don't understand
what happened.

1341
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:56,450
Well, I'll tell you
what happened.

1342
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:58,315
We bet our hard-earned cash
on your horse...

1343
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,980
that's what happened.

1344
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,283
What are you gonna do?

1345
01:05:01,322 --> 01:05:03,290
I'm going to get
a new optometrist.

1346
01:05:03,324 --> 01:05:05,815
Well, well, look who came
to our restaurant.

1347
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,124
The flamingo fairy birds.

1348
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,829
Well, if it isn't the pets
from Pinky's Pet Shop.

1349
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,300
Can I help you guys?

1350
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:15,802
I have a problem.

1351
01:05:15,837 --> 01:05:17,031
Yeah, you're ugly.

1352
01:05:18,473 --> 01:05:20,805
I have lost my wallet.

1353
01:05:20,842 --> 01:05:24,334
It was here in the garbage,
but I cannot find it.

1354
01:05:25,346 --> 01:05:29,043
Perhaps if my friend Renaldo
here helps me look.

1355
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,778
It's very important to me.

1356
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:33,476
What seems to be
the problem here?

1357
01:05:35,023 --> 01:05:36,251
Listen, pal,
I'll have you know...

1358
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,384
that I know jujitsu, karate,
judo, and some other big words.

1359
01:05:39,427 --> 01:05:40,826
So don't mess with me,
all right?

1360
01:05:47,468 --> 01:05:49,902
I think I'm gonna
take my sweater off.

1361
01:05:49,937 --> 01:05:51,370
Hey, get the hell out of here.

1362
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:52,964
Leave my friends alone.

1363
01:05:57,712 --> 01:05:58,906
Think we can get out of this?

1364
01:05:58,946 --> 01:06:00,072
Doesn't look good.

1365
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:01,581
Hey, let go of my nose!

1366
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,418
Hello, police?

1367
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:38,946
Don't worry about it, all right?

1368
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:40,510
Go ahead, your folks
must be worried.

1369
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:41,681
Go on right home.

1370
01:06:41,722 --> 01:06:42,882
Thanks, Mr. Willis.

1371
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:46,853
Everything OK with Fortune?

1372
01:06:46,894 --> 01:06:48,361
Everything's taken care of.

1373
01:06:48,396 --> 01:06:49,522
Good.

1374
01:06:49,564 --> 01:06:51,122
So now I'm a chauffeur.

1375
01:06:51,165 --> 01:06:53,190
I drive to jail,
I pick you up...

1376
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:54,861
I drive you home.
Good-bye. The end.

1377
01:06:54,902 --> 01:06:56,028
Can we talk about this later?

1378
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,537
Well, it's not the end.
There's nothing to talk about.

1379
01:06:57,572 --> 01:06:58,698
Tomorrow?

1380
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:00,900
In Brooklyn, you go to school.
In Long Island, you go to jail.

1381
01:07:00,942 --> 01:07:02,341
From now on,
you stay in Brooklyn.

1382
01:07:11,352 --> 01:07:12,910
You couldn't go to dinner
with your family.

1383
01:07:13,754 --> 01:07:17,053
You had to go out
with your friends...

1384
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:18,251
the bums and gamblers.

1385
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,358
Hey, they're good people.

1386
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:21,520
They are good people.

1387
01:07:21,562 --> 01:07:23,894
What have you learned from
your fancy Long Island friends?

1388
01:07:23,931 --> 01:07:26,923
My friends in Long Island
know how to have a good time.

1389
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:29,228
And that's where
we'd be right now...

1390
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:32,364
if you didn't save every penny
and stuff it under your pillow.

1391
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,702
But no, we have to live
in that dump in Brooklyn.

1392
01:07:57,431 --> 01:08:00,264
The biggest robbery
in Britain's history was perp...

1393
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:05,899
You got the right time?

1394
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,740
Thanks.

1395
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:28,588
Is that you, Arthur?

1396
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:32,064
It's all right, Ruth.

1397
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:33,191
Jeffrey...

1398
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:39,199
Look, I'm...

1399
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:42,304
I'm sorry I hit you.

1400
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:44,607
No, dad. Dad, it's OK.

1401
01:08:57,658 --> 01:08:59,387
You going back there tomorrow?

1402
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,827
Yes... I am.

1403
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:06,029
To the fast-car salesman?

1404
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:09,862
There's something
you should know...

1405
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:11,235
about your father, Jeffrey.

1406
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:14,640
Fast things frighten him.

1407
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:18,872
Your Uncle Jack
is always going fast...

1408
01:09:18,913 --> 01:09:20,039
taking short cuts.

1409
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:21,241
It always hurts him.

1410
01:09:27,588 --> 01:09:30,614
Well, I'm not frightened
of fast things, OK?

1411
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:35,260
I remember my...

1412
01:09:36,564 --> 01:09:38,156
I remember my father
telling me...

1413
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:40,531
there are only
2 important things in living.

1414
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,236
He said, finding out
what you do well...

1415
01:09:44,272 --> 01:09:45,899
and finding out
what makes you happy.

1416
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:51,935
If God is smiling on you,
they're both the same thing.

1417
01:09:53,848 --> 01:09:55,042
I'll remember that, Dad.

1418
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:07,353
What are you packing?

1419
01:10:07,395 --> 01:10:08,828
I'm moving out.

1420
01:10:08,863 --> 01:10:09,989
What?

1421
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:11,794
I think it's just best
if I go for a while.

1422
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:17,870
Where? What will you do?

1423
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:19,566
Mr. Brody offered me a job.

1424
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:24,371
He told me to come see him
when I'm ready, and I'm ready.

1425
01:11:51,999 --> 01:11:54,490
So, what is so important
that you interrupted me...

1426
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:55,797
in the middle of
the dance class?

1427
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:58,134
Well, I feel I'm ready
to work for you, Mr. Brody.

1428
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:00,768
You pulled me off the floor
to tell me...

1429
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:02,332
that you're ready
to work for me?

1430
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:05,504
Yeah. I figure if I
sell one car a month...

1431
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:06,706
it'll cover my whole nut.

1432
01:12:07,882 --> 01:12:09,042
Well, I guess so.

1433
01:12:10,384 --> 01:12:12,511
So you really want to go
into the automobile business?

1434
01:12:12,553 --> 01:12:13,815
Very much so, sir.

1435
01:12:15,556 --> 01:12:16,853
Well, Jeffrey,
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1436
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:18,324
To show you that
I'm a man of my word...

1437
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:19,849
I promised you
I would give you a job...

1438
01:12:19,894 --> 01:12:21,191
when you said you are ready.

1439
01:12:21,228 --> 01:12:24,026
Well, you tell me you're ready,
so I'm gonna give you a job.

1440
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,123
I'm gonna bring you up
to my lot in Yonkers.

1441
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:28,995
There's an opening there
for a stock boy.

1442
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,597
Stock boy?

1443
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:32,765
Now, wait.

1444
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,138
I don't want to hear
disappointment.

1445
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:35,403
Just a minute, there.

1446
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:37,503
Well, after we talked...

1447
01:12:37,545 --> 01:12:41,504
I was under the impression
that I was to be a salesman.

1448
01:12:41,549 --> 01:12:43,642
Yeah, you're going to be
a salesman.

1449
01:12:43,684 --> 01:12:44,844
You're going to be.

1450
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:48,246
But when you plant a tree...

1451
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,988
you don't hang a swing on it
the next day.

1452
01:12:51,025 --> 01:12:52,492
See, the tree has got to grow.

1453
01:12:52,526 --> 01:12:54,653
It's got to mature.
That's what you're...

1454
01:12:54,695 --> 01:12:56,128
I understand that.

1455
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,494
Let me put it another way
to you.

1456
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:00,492
Nobody is gonna come
into my showroom...

1457
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:02,502
and buy a $10,000
foreign automobile...

1458
01:13:02,536 --> 01:13:04,868
from a kid who looks like he
just got his driver's license.

1459
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,107
We all have to start someplace.

1460
01:13:08,142 --> 01:13:09,302
Yeah.

1461
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:12,078
Well, you know, it's my father.

1462
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:13,841
He wants me to go to college.

1463
01:13:13,881 --> 01:13:15,508
And I... I just feel like...

1464
01:13:15,549 --> 01:13:17,847
I don't know if I want to go.
I think I'd rather...

1465
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:19,045
I love this tune.

1466
01:13:20,988 --> 01:13:23,821
I never knew there were so many
pretty ladies in that class.

1467
01:13:26,894 --> 01:13:28,657
So now I spell stock boy.

1468
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:42,301
Jeffrey, somebody threw up
in the cabana C bathroom.

1469
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,503
Clean it up.

1470
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:54,552
Attention club members.

1471
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:58,316
There are still a few tickets
left for the Labor Day dance.

1472
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:00,623
You can purchase them
from the snack bar.

1473
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:16,843
So, are you going
to take a pretty girl...

1474
01:14:16,877 --> 01:14:18,037
to the Labor Day dance?

1475
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:20,009
Nope.

1476
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:21,514
Yeah, I guess no one
would want to dance...

1477
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:23,346
with a stock boy, anyway.

1478
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:24,544
Ouch.

1479
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:28,588
Come on... do you really have
to leave tomorrow?

1480
01:14:29,557 --> 01:14:32,424
Yes. But we have
all night together.

1481
01:15:25,713 --> 01:15:27,112
You see that ship over there?

1482
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:29,007
Yeah. I've sat here nights...

1483
01:15:29,049 --> 01:15:30,710
and watched the ship
go back and forth.

1484
01:15:30,751 --> 01:15:33,447
It's not the same ship
you've been seeing every night.

1485
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,455
It's different ships
doing the same thing...

1486
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,649
boxing the compass.

1487
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:38,651
Boxing the compass?

1488
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,218
Yeah. Ok.

1489
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:42,990
You see those 2 lights
out there?

1490
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,156
Yeah.

1491
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:47,133
Ok, the one over here,
Ambrose light, New Jersey.

1492
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,965
The brighter one to the right,
Scotland light, New York.

1493
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,972
Outgoing ships
sail back and forth...

1494
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,439
in between those two lights.

1495
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:55,305
Then they set their compasses.

1496
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,572
And when they're all set,
they sail off to sea.

1497
01:15:58,278 --> 01:16:01,076
Europe, Africa, China.

1498
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:03,182
How do you know
all this, Jeffrey?

1499
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,148
Oh, it's my father.

1500
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:06,652
He's a nautical buff.

1501
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,154
You know... he never actually
went anywhere...

1502
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:14,991
but he dreams about that stuff,
you know?

1503
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,519
There's nothing wrong
with dreaming.

1504
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,556
No.

1505
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,261
There's nothing wrong
with dreaming.

1506
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,939
Hey, you know what I would do
if I could change the map?

1507
01:16:27,975 --> 01:16:29,101
No, what?

1508
01:16:29,143 --> 01:16:30,576
I'd take
the Statue of Liberty...

1509
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:33,011
and I'd, I don't know,
I'd put it up in the Bronx.

1510
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,947
Right? I'd get rid
of that right away.

1511
01:16:34,982 --> 01:16:37,348
And I'd take Los Angeles...

1512
01:16:38,352 --> 01:16:40,343
not all of Los Angeles,
but a little part...

1513
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,513
where you live...

1514
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,682
and I'd put it where
the statue used to be.

1515
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:44,850
Right?

1516
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,917
So this way, we'd be...
we could be close to each other.

1517
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,222
Wouldn't that be nice?

1518
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,129
You know, Thanksgiving's
only a few months away.

1519
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,300
Maybe you can come to
California and visit me.

1520
01:16:58,338 --> 01:17:00,203
I'd like that.
That would be very nice.

1521
01:17:04,645 --> 01:17:07,011
Hey, why not?
The Dodgers did it, right?

1522
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,274
I won't forget
this summer, Jeffrey.

1523
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,719
I'm going to miss you.

1524
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,089
I'll miss you, too.

1525
01:17:41,048 --> 01:17:42,208
Hi!

1526
01:17:43,717 --> 01:17:45,014
How are you, Jeffrey?

1527
01:17:45,052 --> 01:17:46,849
Hey, Nikki.
What are you doing here?

1528
01:17:46,887 --> 01:17:48,514
Are you alone?
You didn't bring them, did you?

1529
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:50,523
Yeah, I took a swing
out by myself.

1530
01:17:50,557 --> 01:17:51,683
Great.

1531
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:53,522
Mom sent some socks
and underwear.

1532
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,686
Oh, good.

1533
01:17:54,728 --> 01:17:56,525
She figured you'd be
running out by now.

1534
01:17:56,563 --> 01:17:57,723
Yeah, I was.

1535
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:02,027
Well, guess what.

1536
01:18:02,069 --> 01:18:03,866
We're all going out
to dinner tonight.

1537
01:18:03,904 --> 01:18:05,531
Oh, yeah? Who's going?

1538
01:18:05,572 --> 01:18:08,405
Mom, Dad, me, Uncle Jack.

1539
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:10,699
Guess where we're going.

1540
01:18:10,744 --> 01:18:12,177
Dad's favorite restaurant.

1541
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:14,305
Don't tell me.
Larry's Fishouse, right?

1542
01:18:14,348 --> 01:18:15,872
"Whatever fish you wish."

1543
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:18,714
Jeffrey,
will you give me a hand?

1544
01:18:18,752 --> 01:18:20,720
Listen, looks like you're
pretty busy...

1545
01:18:20,754 --> 01:18:22,483
so I'm gonna go, OK?

1546
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,391
And... bye.

1547
01:18:26,426 --> 01:18:27,723
Ok.

1548
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:28,921
All right. Bye.

1549
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,097
Attention, staff.

1550
01:18:36,136 --> 01:18:38,798
It's Labor Day. Go get 'em.

1551
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,337
Hello, Mr. Sweet Ginger Brown.

1552
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,501
We'll murder you.

1553
01:18:42,543 --> 01:18:44,511
Hot enough for you today,
Mrs. Unger?

1554
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:46,513
It must be 105!

1555
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:48,344
Hey, any of you guys
want to make a bet...

1556
01:18:48,382 --> 01:18:49,713
on the Mets game today?

1557
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,688
Come on. How about you, Phil?
Five bucks?

1558
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:57,212
The Mets couldn't even
beat the Mets.

1559
01:19:06,066 --> 01:19:08,227
What's this? What is this?

1560
01:19:08,902 --> 01:19:10,028
Jeffrey, what...

1561
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,560
Jeffrey, what is this?

1562
01:19:18,245 --> 01:19:21,214
Jesus Christ! This place is
turning into a kindergarten.

1563
01:19:21,248 --> 01:19:23,273
Come on, let's play cards.

1564
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:58,946
Will you stop
with the hula hoop?

1565
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:01,481
Go tell your mother I'm busy.

1566
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,720
Hawk, let's go.

1567
01:20:16,737 --> 01:20:18,534
Are you watching?
You're not even watching.

1568
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:20,039
- I'm watching. It's hot.
- Look.

1569
01:20:20,073 --> 01:20:21,802
Colonel Easton needs
a 5 to win.

1570
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:24,101
Or a 3 to win.

1571
01:20:24,144 --> 01:20:25,543
And Brody has both.

1572
01:20:25,579 --> 01:20:28,605
And he's about to throw
the 3 and finally lose a game.

1573
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,997
He's gonna throw
the 5 now. Look...

1574
01:20:47,034 --> 01:20:48,194
There he goes.

1575
01:21:04,584 --> 01:21:06,176
He's breaking up a meld.
He's throwing a 10!

1576
01:21:06,219 --> 01:21:07,379
He broke up a meld.

1577
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:15,361
The guy is a genius!
He's psychotic.

1578
01:21:15,395 --> 01:21:16,521
Psychic.

1579
01:21:16,563 --> 01:21:18,360
Yeah. Psychic.
That's what I meant. Psychic.

1580
01:21:27,574 --> 01:21:29,041
Charlie, would you
stop coughing?

1581
01:21:29,076 --> 01:21:30,202
You should quit smoking.

1582
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:31,733
I don't smoke.

1583
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:33,971
You should start.

1584
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,140
Boy, it's hot.

1585
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,810
Come on, Paddy, what do you want
to drink? Scotch?

1586
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:38,977
No, nothing for me.
Thanks.

1587
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,247
I've been on the wagon
for two weeks.

1588
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:41,811
We're 90 points ahead.

1589
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,482
It'll take another
2 weeks to digest...

1590
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,684
all those margaritas you drank
the night you quit.

1591
01:21:48,328 --> 01:21:49,488
Sid!

1592
01:21:50,897 --> 01:21:52,023
My arm!

1593
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:53,464
Oh, my God!
He crushed the colonel.

1594
01:21:55,635 --> 01:21:57,535
Give him air, everybody.
That's what they always say.

1595
01:21:57,571 --> 01:21:59,004
Don't pull him! Leave him alone,
for Christ's sake.

1596
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,165
Let a doctor look at him.

1597
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,333
Where's Dr. Gold?

1598
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,501
Underwater.

1599
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:03,702
Dr. Gold!

1600
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:06,705
Dr. Gold!

1601
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,508
Excuse me.

1602
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,675
Excuse me, Dr. Gold.

1603
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,843
What?

1604
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,819
There's an accident.
Big Sid passed out.

1605
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:15,344
Dirk, come quick!

1606
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:16,515
I'm Turk. He's Dirk.

1607
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,183
Dirk, Turk. Emergency!

1608
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,523
- What's he saying?
- I think he's choking.

1609
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,857
Relax. We're lifeguards.

1610
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,192
Come on, take it easy.

1611
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,754
Excuse me.

1612
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:25,924
Gentlemen, the doctor's here.

1613
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,092
Excuse me.

1614
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:28,863
Me first, Doc. I own the club.

1615
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,028
What happened?

1616
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,867
Ouch! My arm hurts!

1617
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,065
Will you move out of the way?

1618
01:22:34,174 --> 01:22:35,971
Can I ride in
the ambulance with you, Colonel?

1619
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:37,135
No.

1620
01:22:37,177 --> 01:22:40,305
Well, then, can I at least be
the first to sign your cast?

1621
01:22:40,347 --> 01:22:42,315
Shut up, Hawk.

1622
01:22:42,349 --> 01:22:44,476
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

1623
01:22:44,518 --> 01:22:45,644
I got the lifeguards.

1624
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:48,984
What about the game, Charlie?
We're out 1,900 apiece.

1625
01:22:49,022 --> 01:22:50,148
Alley-oop!

1626
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,316
Stay back, everyone.

1627
01:22:51,358 --> 01:22:52,484
Sid will be OK.

1628
01:22:52,526 --> 01:22:53,652
It's just a little sunstroke.

1629
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:54,819
Clear out of the way!

1630
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,328
Excuse us, Mr. Brody, excuse us.

1631
01:22:56,363 --> 01:22:58,354
We're giving him
medical assistance immediately.

1632
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,496
I have to get to the hospital.

1633
01:23:00,534 --> 01:23:01,660
Well, you picked
a hell of a way...

1634
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:02,861
to win a purple heart.

1635
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:05,161
Sorry, boys. Good luck, boys.

1636
01:23:05,205 --> 01:23:06,331
Take it easy.

1637
01:23:06,373 --> 01:23:08,170
How do you break
an arm playing gin?

1638
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,698
It's a bad break, fellas.

1639
01:23:10,877 --> 01:23:12,037
It's a tough way to end it.

1640
01:23:12,879 --> 01:23:14,870
The summer's not over yet, Phil.

1641
01:23:15,715 --> 01:23:17,012
But it's getting there.

1642
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,211
Yeah, I can feel it in my bones.

1643
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:22,745
You know, the truth is that...

1644
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,353
Hal was having kind
of a bad day today.

1645
01:23:25,392 --> 01:23:26,518
You fellows are lucky.

1646
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,859
See, this way, kind of
cuts your losses.

1647
01:23:29,896 --> 01:23:31,022
Forget it, Phil.

1648
01:23:31,064 --> 01:23:32,224
Mario!

1649
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,660
Mario!

1650
01:23:36,169 --> 01:23:39,161
The bottom line is, you got to
come up with a third...

1651
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,000
or I'm going to go home.

1652
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:44,135
See, I just put a $3,500
air conditioning unit...

1653
01:23:44,177 --> 01:23:45,439
in my house.
I'd like to try it out.

1654
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,141
Oh, incidentally,
you paid for it.

1655
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,213
I'll be the third.

1656
01:23:52,686 --> 01:23:53,846
You what?

1657
01:23:54,855 --> 01:23:56,015
I'll play you.

1658
01:23:56,923 --> 01:23:58,652
What's the matter with you?

1659
01:23:58,692 --> 01:24:00,057
You got sunstroke, too?

1660
01:24:01,194 --> 01:24:02,320
Nope.

1661
01:24:02,362 --> 01:24:06,025
Jeffrey, what are you saying?

1662
01:24:07,033 --> 01:24:09,194
Mr. Cooper, I want to play
on your team.

1663
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,837
The kid's good.
I've seen him play.

1664
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:17,002
Come on, he's playing
with our money.

1665
01:24:17,043 --> 01:24:18,874
What choice do we have?

1666
01:24:24,217 --> 01:24:25,684
Are you serious?

1667
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:27,050
Yeah, we're serious.

1668
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:30,712
What's the matter, Phil?
You afraid of the kid?

1669
01:24:33,059 --> 01:24:34,390
Well, why not?

1670
01:24:38,064 --> 01:24:41,056
Be kind of like a baptism
into the game.

1671
01:24:45,005 --> 01:24:47,633
This could be a very
interesting afternoon, Jeffrey.

1672
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:48,971
In?

1673
01:24:49,009 --> 01:24:50,340
Come on, kid. Let's go.

1674
01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:52,971
We got him.

1675
01:24:53,013 --> 01:24:54,640
What are we gonna do
about a cabana boy?

1676
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:56,672
Hey, can we get
a cabana boy over here?

1677
01:25:00,787 --> 01:25:03,483
I predict this will be
a short afternoon.

1678
01:25:03,523 --> 01:25:06,321
Don't let him scare you,
Jeffrey.

1679
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:07,656
It's all over!

1680
01:25:07,694 --> 01:25:08,922
That's it for the Yankees.

1681
01:25:08,962 --> 01:25:12,193
And they'll have to settle
for a split this afternoon.

1682
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,666
I'm going home
to change for the dance.

1683
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:15,827
Yeah, fine. That's good.

1684
01:25:15,869 --> 01:25:17,029
That's nice. Yeah.

1685
01:25:19,873 --> 01:25:22,671
Are you coming, or shall I bring
your clothes back here?

1686
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:23,869
Yeah. Whatever.

1687
01:25:25,212 --> 01:25:26,736
I may not go to the dance,
Phyllis.

1688
01:25:29,716 --> 01:25:33,550
Phil, isn't that our cabana boy?

1689
01:25:36,656 --> 01:25:38,351
It's Jeffrey. Yeah.

1690
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:40,621
You're playing our cabana boy?

1691
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,820
Phyllis.

1692
01:25:43,496 --> 01:25:44,622
He can't come to the dance...

1693
01:25:44,664 --> 01:25:46,325
because he's playing
our cabana boy.

1694
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:49,328
I'm going out
of my fucking mind!

1695
01:25:49,369 --> 01:25:50,961
I'm telling you the truth.

1696
01:25:51,004 --> 01:25:52,335
Yeah, you'll see
in a minute, Alfred.

1697
01:25:52,372 --> 01:25:54,465
Manheim!

1698
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:56,168
Jeffrey's playing
in the big gin game.

1699
01:25:57,143 --> 01:25:58,474
Danny! Danny, come here!

1700
01:25:58,511 --> 01:25:59,978
Jeffrey's playing
in the big gin game.

1701
01:26:00,714 --> 01:26:02,614
You see?
What did I tell you, you jerk?

1702
01:26:03,817 --> 01:26:05,978
How's he doing?

1703
01:26:08,488 --> 01:26:09,648
Relax, kid.

1704
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:11,179
You're not playing
with your own money.

1705
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:18,357
I'm going to take that...

1706
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:22,930
and I'm going to knock with 7.

1707
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,665
Hawk, I think you're bad luck.

1708
01:26:25,705 --> 01:26:28,230
Lay them down, kid.
Read them and weep.

1709
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:31,002
Oh, yeah.

1710
01:26:31,044 --> 01:26:32,875
There's the old king
you were looking for.

1711
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:37,179
Let's see.

1712
01:26:37,217 --> 01:26:40,186
My queen on your jack.
My jack on your 10.

1713
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,847
My 4 on your 4's.

1714
01:26:41,888 --> 01:26:44,288
I underknock you with 5,
Mr. Brody.

1715
01:26:45,191 --> 01:26:46,488
Kid underknocked!

1716
01:26:46,526 --> 01:26:47,720
Way to go, kid!

1717
01:26:48,395 --> 01:26:50,522
That gives me 20 points
for the underknock...

1718
01:26:50,563 --> 01:26:52,190
plus 2 is 22 points.

1719
01:26:52,232 --> 01:26:53,426
He's hot.

1720
01:26:53,466 --> 01:26:55,024
I taught him everything
he knows.

1721
01:26:55,068 --> 01:26:56,592
Back off. Back off.

1722
01:26:56,636 --> 01:26:59,104
Your deal, sir. I do believe
you play loser deals.

1723
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:07,878
Good play, Jeffrey.

1724
01:27:17,257 --> 01:27:19,225
You want something
to drink, Jeffrey?

1725
01:27:19,259 --> 01:27:21,056
Oh, no thank you, Mr. Brody.

1726
01:27:21,094 --> 01:27:22,391
Phil, Jeffrey.

1727
01:27:22,429 --> 01:27:23,589
Phil.

1728
01:27:24,431 --> 01:27:25,557
Gin, Phil.

1729
01:27:25,598 --> 01:27:28,567
All right!
Oh, 5 hands in a row.

1730
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:30,228
He's on a roll.

1731
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:32,101
20 knock.

1732
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,172
This is ridiculous.

1733
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,340
It's freezing out here.

1734
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:43,508
Let's go inside.

1735
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:44,847
It looks like it's
gonna rain anyway.

1736
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,351
All right with you, cabana boy?

1737
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:47,512
Fine with me.

1738
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:48,851
Quit whining, Mario.

1739
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,515
I'm not whining. I'm winning.

1740
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,355
You guys still predicting
a short afternoon?

1741
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:57,856
It's fiesta time
as we bring to a close...

1742
01:27:57,897 --> 01:28:00,525
another summer of fun
under the sun...

1743
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,558
as you dance
to the Latin tempos...

1744
01:28:02,602 --> 01:28:05,400
of Aaron Rosenthal
and his orchestra.

1745
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,037
So where's my blind date?

1746
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,200
She'll be here.

1747
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,039
They're coming in
all the way from the Bronx.

1748
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,170
Hey, Steve! Hey, Joyce.

1749
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:15,471
So, what, are you fixing me up
with a bimbo?

1750
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:17,506
No. They're young girls.

1751
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:19,548
Bimbettes.

1752
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,615
That's gin.

1753
01:28:27,193 --> 01:28:29,058
Hey, what happened?
Who's winning?

1754
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,154
They're making a comeback
led by Jeffrey Willis.

1755
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:34,223
This is the last set.
We win this one, we're even.

1756
01:28:35,368 --> 01:28:38,166
Charlie, we lost our ass
all summer.

1757
01:28:38,204 --> 01:28:39,466
I want better than even.

1758
01:28:41,674 --> 01:28:45,201
Hey, Phil, what do you say
we double the stakes?

1759
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:49,004
Double the stakes?

1760
01:28:51,217 --> 01:28:52,809
Yeah, sure. Come on.

1761
01:28:54,053 --> 01:28:55,486
It will be a pleasure.

1762
01:29:07,734 --> 01:29:08,860
You like cards?

1763
01:29:08,902 --> 01:29:11,234
Yeah. My favorite are birthday
and Valentine's Day.

1764
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,200
Gin.

1765
01:29:17,076 --> 01:29:20,045
Hey, what do you know?

1766
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:21,546
Gin.

1767
01:29:21,581 --> 01:29:22,741
All right.

1768
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:26,309
Gin.

1769
01:29:26,352 --> 01:29:28,877
Add them up.

1770
01:29:28,922 --> 01:29:30,253
Yeah. This is catching.

1771
01:29:31,257 --> 01:29:33,384
You know you got a big space
in between your teeth?

1772
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:36,128
You know you have
a big fucking nose?

1773
01:29:39,866 --> 01:29:41,493
We're done, Jeffrey.

1774
01:29:41,534 --> 01:29:42,933
It's up to you now.

1775
01:29:50,877 --> 01:29:53,402
If Jeffrey wins this hand,
it's all over.

1776
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,747
How do you play gin?

1777
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,457
What are you looking for?

1778
01:30:09,462 --> 01:30:11,191
Big Sid isn't
here anymore, Phil.

1779
01:30:11,231 --> 01:30:12,459
It's just you and me.

1780
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:16,595
Come on.

1781
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:18,365
What did he say?

1782
01:30:20,173 --> 01:30:21,538
Don't get your hopes up, kid.

1783
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,540
No one's ever blanked me.

1784
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:27,239
Throw a card.

1785
01:30:46,533 --> 01:30:48,763
Sweet Ginger Brown.

1786
01:30:53,172 --> 01:30:54,662
All right!

1787
01:31:05,885 --> 01:31:08,513
Come on, Mr. Brody,
it's only a game.

1788
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:11,451
You know, Gloria...

1789
01:31:11,491 --> 01:31:13,015
I taught the kid
everything he knows.

1790
01:31:15,228 --> 01:31:17,196
Hey, Phil, it was a good game.

1791
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1792
01:31:18,565 --> 01:31:21,193
What the hell?
It's a few bucks.

1793
01:31:21,234 --> 01:31:22,861
The kid got lucky, that's all.

1794
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,038
Did we show him?
Right in the gut!

1795
01:31:26,072 --> 01:31:28,905
Mario, I stopped coughing.

1796
01:31:31,578 --> 01:31:32,738
Partner?

1797
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:42,177
If you ever need a piece
of used furniture...

1798
01:31:44,857 --> 01:31:46,017
Enough said.

1799
01:31:46,926 --> 01:31:48,325
How much do we make
the checks out for?

1800
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:49,521
Write them all.

1801
01:31:50,396 --> 01:31:51,556
Could I get cash?

1802
01:31:51,598 --> 01:31:52,724
Sure.

1803
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:53,891
Let me go show him the damage.

1804
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:57,494
Jeffrey, you're a real artist,
a genius with numbers.

1805
01:31:57,537 --> 01:31:59,334
You got a great card sense.

1806
01:31:59,372 --> 01:32:00,737
Well, it's just a game.

1807
01:32:01,874 --> 01:32:04,502
It's not just a game.
It's a way of life.

1808
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:06,876
We came back
against a better team.

1809
01:32:12,051 --> 01:32:13,382
Not really.

1810
01:32:14,554 --> 01:32:16,818
Mr. Cooper, I have
to tell you something.

1811
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:20,281
Gentlemen, we'll be waiting
for our cash over here.

1812
01:32:22,395 --> 01:32:24,522
So mad, Teddy's neck is red.

1813
01:32:24,564 --> 01:32:26,361
It's like this.
He's going crazy.

1814
01:32:27,033 --> 01:32:28,523
Hey, don't worry.
Your cash is coming, Jeffrey.

1815
01:32:28,568 --> 01:32:29,694
Ok. I'm going to go get changed.

1816
01:32:29,736 --> 01:32:30,862
I'll come by and pick it up.

1817
01:32:30,903 --> 01:32:32,029
Right here, all right?

1818
01:32:32,071 --> 01:32:33,129
What's the matter, Charlie?

1819
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,298
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

1820
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,466
Hey.

1821
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:38,068
Oh, Jeffrey, thank you
for being our cabana boy.

1822
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:39,544
- Ok.
- See you next summer.

1823
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:41,672
Maybe. So long, Peter.

1824
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:44,509
Hey, Jeffrey.

1825
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,313
You played all right.

1826
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:49,753
Yeah, I like your style.

1827
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,620
Hey, what the hell.
It's a game, right?

1828
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,485
Look, I'll tell you what.

1829
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,995
I want you to forget
about that Yonkers thing.

1830
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,430
You know, stock boy.
Come work for me.

1831
01:32:59,465 --> 01:33:00,693
With me.

1832
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,829
And maybe I'll send you out
to my new place, Newport.

1833
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,764
The beach. California.

1834
01:33:07,807 --> 01:33:10,503
You'd be near my niece Carla
with the pretty face.

1835
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:11,669
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1836
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,871
I told them.

1837
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,578
What are you talking about?
You told them what?

1838
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:19,746
Well, I had to.
About you and Big Sid.

1839
01:33:19,786 --> 01:33:20,946
Your scam.

1840
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:25,647
You can't go around screwing
your friends, Mr. Brody.

1841
01:33:29,996 --> 01:33:31,395
Phil. Hey, Phil!

1842
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:35,066
Relax. Relax. Will you relax?

1843
01:33:35,101 --> 01:33:36,728
You'd listen to a kid
that cleans toilets?

1844
01:33:36,769 --> 01:33:37,929
You cheated?

1845
01:33:41,507 --> 01:33:42,872
Jeffrey, sit.

1846
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,069
Sit.

1847
01:33:45,678 --> 01:33:47,145
At the El Flamingo...

1848
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,671
the king does not
get his own car...

1849
01:33:49,716 --> 01:33:51,980
even if the car is mine.

1850
01:33:52,018 --> 01:33:54,043
Here you go, Mr. Willis.

1851
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:59,317
Steve, thank you for
letting me use your car.

1852
01:33:59,358 --> 01:34:00,825
I'll get it back
to you tomorrow.

1853
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,658
I'll be at the University
of Las Vegas if you need me.

1854
01:34:03,696 --> 01:34:06,324
Jeffrey, you are a better
card player than I am...

1855
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:07,957
but I'm still better
at horses.

1856
01:34:09,035 --> 01:34:10,627
Steve, you're breathing
on my neck.

1857
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:11,796
Your chariot, sir.

1858
01:34:11,838 --> 01:34:13,169
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1859
01:34:13,206 --> 01:34:14,673
Well, don't do it on my shirt.

1860
01:34:14,707 --> 01:34:16,140
It's your shirt
that's making me sick.

1861
01:34:16,876 --> 01:34:18,366
Fortune, thanks a lot.

1862
01:34:18,411 --> 01:34:19,537
It's been good working with you.

1863
01:34:19,579 --> 01:34:20,705
- Mandy!
- I mean it.

1864
01:34:20,747 --> 01:34:22,647
Mandy, get over here, quick!

1865
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:26,180
All right, Steve.
Mandy's coming.

1866
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,448
Hey, Fortune,
come here for a minute.

1867
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:30,854
- He's breaking my neck.
- What's wrong with him?

1868
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,016
This is for you.

1869
01:34:32,058 --> 01:34:33,525
Oh, he's just drunk!

1870
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:36,321
What's this?

1871
01:34:36,362 --> 01:34:37,488
It's your tip.

1872
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:38,690
Good luck at Notre Dame.

1873
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,965
Stay away from Yonkers Raceway,
will you?

1874
01:34:46,839 --> 01:34:48,101
My tip.

1875
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,540
Hi, Dad.

1876
01:35:29,215 --> 01:35:30,705
I got to get a fresh toothpick.

1877
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:33,509
Hey, pull up a chair.

1878
01:35:33,553 --> 01:35:34,679
Jeffrey.

1879
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,950
You play great accordion.
Come back later.

1880
01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:38,115
Jeffrey!

1881
01:35:38,157 --> 01:35:39,624
Hey, Jeffrey.
How you doing, kid?

1882
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:41,058
I can't believe it!

1883
01:35:41,093 --> 01:35:42,685
Could we get another chair?

1884
01:35:42,728 --> 01:35:44,025
Good to see you.

1885
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,891
He looks good, huh?

1886
01:35:49,936 --> 01:35:51,801
Should we have them bring
your food over here?

1887
01:35:51,838 --> 01:35:53,362
How's your Mr. Brophy?

1888
01:35:54,974 --> 01:35:56,168
Summer's over.

1889
01:36:00,613 --> 01:36:02,046
Summer's over?

1890
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,981
I'm just standing here
watching another ship...

1891
01:36:07,019 --> 01:36:09,681
boxing its compass
and venturing out to sea.

1892
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:14,357
It's nice to know that it
can go home if it needs to.

1893
01:36:16,028 --> 01:36:18,155
If he talks nice
to the lighthouse keeper...

1894
01:36:18,197 --> 01:36:19,357
he can always come home.

1895
01:36:20,766 --> 01:36:22,666
Yeah, well, maybe if
the lighthouse keeper...

1896
01:36:22,702 --> 01:36:24,329
didn't yell so much...

1897
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:25,997
Well, the reason
the lighthouse keeper yells...

1898
01:36:26,038 --> 01:36:27,505
What the hell
are we talking about?

1899
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,802
You coming home or what?

1900
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:30,103
Yeah, I'm coming home,
all right?

1901
01:36:30,142 --> 01:36:31,666
But then I'm getting
my own apartment!

1902
01:36:31,711 --> 01:36:33,611
Good. All right.
Then it's over?

1903
01:36:33,646 --> 01:36:35,375
Yeah, it's over. Yeah. Fine.

1904
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:36,676
All right. Good, good. Come on.

1905
01:36:36,716 --> 01:36:37,842
Come on, Dad.

1906
01:36:37,884 --> 01:36:39,181
This is a crowded
restaurant here.

1907
01:36:39,218 --> 01:36:41,186
I'm sorry... come on, let's go.

1908
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:42,380
Dad.

1909
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:45,356
Hey. All right.

1910
01:36:48,027 --> 01:36:49,187
Fine.

1911
01:36:51,564 --> 01:36:52,997
What are you looking at?

1912
01:36:53,032 --> 01:36:54,158
Eat your halibut
and mind your own business.

1913
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,929
Yeah, eat your halibut...

1914
01:36:55,968 --> 01:36:58,129
and mind your own business,
will you?

1915
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:59,364
Clementine for my brother Jack.

1916
01:36:59,405 --> 01:37:00,565
Oh, no, no!
