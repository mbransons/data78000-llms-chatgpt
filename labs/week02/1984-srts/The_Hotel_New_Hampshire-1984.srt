1
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,142
Our story begins with another story.

2
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,342
It was our favourite story.

3
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,111
How mother and father met
when they took a summer job

4
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,871
at the Hotel New Hampshire.

5
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,307
And how Freud arrived with his bear.

6
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:50,223
- What was the bear's name?
- State of Maine.

7
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,026
The bear...

8
00:00:55,572 --> 00:01:00,025
- was in his last legs.
- But they were the only legs he had.

9
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,913
Don't cut out all the juicy parts
cause you think they're too young

10
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,513
to hear about all the screwing around.

11
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:05,550
Franny!

12
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:09,193
Let's just say they hadn't
consumated their relationship.

13
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:12,346
There was not the promiscuity
and freedom there is today.

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:34,224
I didn't expect to meet anybody
from the same hometown.

15
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:38,948
I like the way your hair looks.

16
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,425
I'm glad that someone I know is here.

17
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:50,869
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I want to know you.

18
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,666
And I want you to know me.

19
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:57,627
It will be two years before
I can afford to enter Harvard.

20
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,709
I think it's wonderful you got in.

21
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,396
Why wouldn't I have gotten in?

22
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,909
It's Freud and State of Maine!

23
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:12,987
The Freud?

24
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:19,519
Give me a ride, Freud.

25
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,672
Nobody rides with me but State of Maine.

26
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:56,116
Well, just a few things
still to iron out.

27
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:04,440
One fateful day everything
really started to go wrong.

28
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:07,717
A couple of Germans were
staying at the hotel.

29
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,673
Find the doctor.

30
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,964
Please, find the doctor.

31
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:30,555
We must find the doctor.

32
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:40,285
Good afternoon. What's the matter?

33
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:43,401
- Are you a doctor?
- I'm professor Freud.

34
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:46,526
Freud? Is he a good doctor?

35
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,806
- He's an excellent doctor.
- As long as he's no Jew...

36
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:52,641
He's no Jew. They have no Jews
in New Hampshire.

37
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:06,159
- I'm blind! I'm blind!
- You should have closed your eyes.

38
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,606
I'm warning you, Freud.
This is your last chance.

39
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,044
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:20,489
I tell you he's a Jew. A perfect Jew.

41
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,924
Yes.

42
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,490
I've never seen a motorcycle like this.
This is a piece of junk.

43
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,245
You can try it yourself. Why don't you?

44
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:56,933
I was leaving anyway. I mean,
that isn't my kind of a hotel.

45
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,013
What will you do? Where can you go?

46
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:00,641
Well, back to Europe.

47
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,241
Why back to Europe?

48
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,453
They say there's going
to be a war there.

49
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:08,083
Oh, I don't know. At least
they got smart bears.

50
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:11,014
By the way. You can buy that one.

51
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,894
- I can?
- Two hundred dollars.

52
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:15,494
That's all we earn for the summer.

53
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:18,169
I know. Otherwise I'd have asked
for more.

54
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:22,814
I'm gonna throw in that bike as well,
and give you some good advice.

55
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:27,776
Here it is. You take every opportunity
given to you in this world,

56
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,016
even if you have too many opportunities,

57
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:33,806
because one day the opportunities
stop. You know?

58
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,576
So, you promise me something.

59
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,096
- I promise.
- So do I.

60
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,691
You get married. Right away.

61
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,535
So we got married.>

62
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:48,297
And father went off to the war.

63
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:50,297
Okay, come on, it's bedtime, kids.

64
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,450
- That's it. Come on.
- No. We've gotta have the sad part.

65
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,175
The war changed a lot of things.

66
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,450
Win!

67
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:38,421
I shot a bear! I shot a wild bear!

68
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:39,936
It's my bear!

69
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:04,104
- Now it's bedtime. Come on, let's go.
- Come on, sweetie.

70
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,653
You've got school tomorrow.

71
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:26,825
Ready? Go!

72
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,340
Line them up! Let's go!

73
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,224
- All right.
- Go on!

74
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,660
Come on! Come on!

75
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,544
All right. Line it up.
Let's try it again.

76
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,783
You big creep, Berry!

77
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:57,588
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay.

78
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:00,948
Dairy bulls. Dairy bulls is our name.

79
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,909
Football. Football is our game.

80
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,789
When we play we play it good.

81
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,625
- Like you thought...
- See you later, sweetie.

82
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,425
Fight bulls, fight bulls...

83
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,030
Hey you, stop!

84
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,900
- You're a bitch, Titsie!
- My name is not Titsie, it's Bitty.

85
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,991
All right. Five laps and hit the shower.

86
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,791
So what's this with you and Bitty Tuck?

87
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:31,944
That slut Titsie was making eyes
at Chipper Dove.

88
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,465
He's a shit.

89
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,870
- Okay. I'm gonna get in the shower.
- All right. See you later.

90
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,063
Pop, I'm worried about the school.

91
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:49,311
Admissions are falling. Standards
are falling even more.

92
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,113
Money is getting tighter.

93
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:54,027
Oh, yeah? What do you care about money?

94
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:58,346
You got a great wife, beautiful kids,
you got a good job.

95
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:01,504
What do you care if the pay's not
that great?

96
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,071
Think about it, my boy.
You're a lucky man.

97
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:06,907
I don't want to be a teacher.

98
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,105
You know what I know about you, my son?

99
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:14,265
You live in the future.
You're a daydreamer.

100
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,634
I want something better.

101
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,747
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

102
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,874
- Is John home yet?
- Not yet.

103
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,552
Sorrow.

104
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,145
Come here.

105
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,553
Come here. Hello.

106
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:40,594
- Sorrow farted again.
- Franny, please.

107
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,506
- Stop standing on your toes.
- What?

108
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,717
Stop standing on your toes, Egg.

109
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:50,037
If she hasn't grown in two years,
I doubt she's grown in the last 2 days.

110
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,392
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

111
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:53,065
- Hi, Gramps.
- Hi, honey.

112
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:06,634
Hi.

113
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,753
Hey, kid, you know your sister has
the nicest ass in school?

114
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,600
- Is she banging anybody?
- She's got great tits, too.

115
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,195
Yeah, but her ass is what's
really special.

116
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,593
Say hello to your sister.

117
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,514
Lilly, don't worry about it.

118
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:32,238
- Just try to eat a little more.
- So I'm small. Everybody says so.

119
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,881
So what's the matter with being small?

120
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,590
Nothing, dear, you can be
as small as you want.

121
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:44,514
- What did he say?
- He's a scum.

122
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:48,758
He talked about your ass, your tits,
even your feet.

123
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,392
My feet?

124
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,961
- What did he say about my feet?
- Your ass is all he cares about.

125
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,523
I don't care. I'm not that interested.

126
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,118
Well, he's interested.

127
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,803
Stick with the others.

128
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,722
Some are sweet, but...

129
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:09,801
God! The others are just boring,
boring, boring!

130
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:15,163
- It's important the first time.
- Why?

131
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,278
Because it is.

132
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:21,156
Because it's the first time. It's the one
that sticks with you forever.

133
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,687
Well, everybody knows
what you're thinking.

134
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:32,079
- You don't know what I'm thinking.
- Oh, you mean about me?

135
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:34,843
I know you think about me too much.

136
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:42,887
Remember you used to be
stronger than me, remember?

137
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,640
Oh, let me go! Let me go!

138
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:50,328
- Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!
- Why don't you two grow up?

139
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:51,768
Fuck off, Frank!

140
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:55,008
Franny and John are out here fooling
around with each other again.

141
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,397
They're perverts.

142
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,849
You're a big fink, Frank!

143
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,968
- You fart! You're a turd in a birdbath!
- And you're a whore.

144
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,809
Stop! Stop this! Stop that!

145
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,244
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop it!

146
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,249
Stop!

147
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:13,959
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, kids, knock it off!

148
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,965
- Come on, Goddam hold it!
- Stop it!

149
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,451
- Come on, hold it, kids!
- Stop that!

150
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,531
Hold it!

151
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:22,728
Hold it! Hold it, kids!

152
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,127
Franny, let go of him!

153
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,890
Now look at this.
Where do you hurt, kid?

154
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,360
She kick you in the nuts?

155
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,647
- You okay, Franny?
- She yelled but we could hear you.

156
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,567
Get some air.

157
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:56,210
You all right? You gonna be okay?

158
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:59,682
Breath easy. Breath. Breath easy.

159
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:07,930
Do you know...

160
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,564
how this upsets your mother and me?

161
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,124
How bad it is?

162
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,168
And your grandpa?

163
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:26,846
Imagine that we fought all the time
and you had to live with it.

164
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:31,533
But do we, I mean, do your mother
and I fight? Do we?

165
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:37,577
Win.

166
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,615
Would you like it if we did?

167
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,772
Darling, I think we better take her
to the hospital.

168
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,051
Oh, Franny.

169
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,059
My baby.

170
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,892
Wanna see my stitches?

171
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,330
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

172
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,940
- You know what they look like?
- Pubic hairs.

173
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,012
What's a pubic hair?

174
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,533
They look gross.

175
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,658
- Sorry about your balls, Frank.
- Oh, they're okay.

176
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,100
- Sorry about...
- It's okay.

177
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,853
I'm sorry about everything.

178
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,535
Oh, Sorrow, come on. Get off my bed.

179
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,132
Why do we like each other more
than we like Frank?

180
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:36,491
I don't know, we just do.
We always will. Frank is weird.

181
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:39,622
- Yeah, but he's our brother.
- So what?

182
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,333
You're my brother. That's not
why I like you.

183
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,492
Why do you like me?

184
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,815
I don't know. I just do.

185
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,823
- Get off! Get off!
- It's Frank!

186
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:55,224
Come on, you mud-fucker. You heard
the man, hump it! Hump it!

187
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,344
You love mud puddles, don't you?

188
00:14:57,444 --> 00:15:00,781
- Put it in a boy's ass is as disgusting.
- Stop it! Stop it!

189
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,213
Stop it!

190
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:06,304
- Well! Look who's here.
- Leave him alone!

191
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:07,744
Your brother likes boys.

192
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,744
- Don't you, Frank?
- So what?

193
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,100
Stop it!

194
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:13,866
Hey, no harm done.

195
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:16,143
I wanna talk to you. Alone.

196
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:19,584
Oh, well, sure. That's possible.

197
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:23,141
Right now.

198
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,186
Yeah, well, right now.

199
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:27,145
- Sure.
- Let Frank go.

200
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,784
Yeah, we'll let Frank go. Right, boys?
We were just going to anyway.

201
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:33,707
I just wanna talk to him, that's all.

202
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,142
Just talk.

203
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,868
You rat asshole!

204
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:49,588
You could've been so nice but you had
to be such a shit of a human being.

205
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:50,977
I hate you.

206
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,704
You son-of-a-bitch!

207
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,587
Leave me alone!

208
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,748
Ow, you make me sick!

209
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:58,343
You know you like me.

210
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,059
Come on!

211
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,511
- Thank you.
- Thank you both.

212
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:16,900
Oh, you're welcome.

213
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,261
- I really am queer, you know?
- I know.

214
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,865
It's okay, Frank.

215
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,546
Dear.

216
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:32,068
- I love you.
- I know you do and I love you.

217
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,991
I wanna tell you something.

218
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:45,345
You know that school where I teach
may not be good but it's gonna grow.

219
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,910
- So?
- So...

220
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:53,267
- We're gonna make some money.
- How?

221
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,063
I'll show you.

222
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:02,914
The Thompson female seminary
can only be what it is. An old school.

223
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:05,755
I went to school there.
I know it inside and out.

224
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:07,875
Do you realize how cheaply
one can buy it?

225
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,630
Do you realize how much
it would cost to fix it up?

226
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:14,075
Why a hotel? You're always saying
this is such a crummy town,

227
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:15,595
who'd wanna stay here?

228
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,146
Maybe not want to, but have to.

229
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:21,554
The parents of those kids at our
school, they come to visit, right?

230
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,356
There's no place for them to stay.

231
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:26,111
If there was a hotel here
people would stay here.

232
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,717
- Oh, hi, Howard.
- Oh, it's you, Win Berry.

233
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,345
What're you doing here?

234
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,867
Just between you and me, Howard,
we're gonna buy this place

235
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,116
and turn it into a hotel.

236
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:42,348
Can't you just imagine it?
A family run hotel.

237
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,913
We'll have the place to ourselves
most of the time.

238
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,268
Our hotel.

239
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,954
The hotel New Hampshire.

240
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,277
Hey, come here.

241
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:25,599
If only Dad had found another bear,
he wouldn't have needed to buy a hotel.

242
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:27,597
Franny was right.

243
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:31,082
Just as father thought bears could
survive living with humans,

244
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:34,076
he thought we could survive
living in hotels.

245
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,081
Hey, these are all screwed down.
You can't move them around.

246
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:42,243
Why should anyone have to move
hotel furniture around?

247
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:43,923
You gonna leave the blackboards?

248
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,234
So long as they are clean,
what's the harm?

249
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:50,961
This job's gonna be harder than...

250
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,796
trying to rape a rhinoceros.

251
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,045
This is Miss Rhonda Ray, who's
going to be head maid and waitress.

252
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

253
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:07,806
I'm pleased to meet you.

254
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,406
Miss Ray remembers seeing State
of Maine perform with Pop

255
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,206
when he was touring all those years ago.

256
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,120
But I never believed it was a real bear.

257
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,756
They were trying to undress him.

258
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:21,564
And nobody would get a kick
out of undressing a bear.

259
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,326
Okay.

260
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,798
- No meat.
- No meat?

261
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:41,757
They probably don't even know
what a steak is.

262
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:45,409
- Do you like Rhonda, John?
- He's going to.

263
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,242
Like you and Chipper Dove?

264
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,649
Lilly, try to eat something
and then you'll grow.

265
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:51,845
What's that?

266
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,559
- Who isn't growing?
- It's me.

267
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,759
- I've stopped growing.
- We come from Finland.

268
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,850
- And we never had a dwarf there.
- What are you saying?

269
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,010
Yes.

270
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,560
- A dwarf!
- Bullshit!

271
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,684
She's no dwarf!

272
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,124
She's a baby.

273
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:12,324
Isn't it great having kids?

274
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,645
Why don't you all put your chairs to
my table and have some drinks on me?

275
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,171
Mine is stuck.

276
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:28,121
Everything's screwed down around
here. You know what I'm saying?

277
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:32,409
I mean this is the ship we're on.

278
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:35,242
We're on a big cruise around the world.

279
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:41,413
Around and around the big wheel goes
and where she stops nobody knows.

280
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:45,693
- Everybody ride the rides.
- Fill the glass.

281
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:51,814
- Come on, Pop. Let's get some air.
- Of course your chairs are nailed down.

282
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:56,366
That way when the shit hits the fan
at the Hotel New Hampshire...

283
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:58,975
- What are you doing later, sweetie?
- Come on, Pop.

284
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,048
Nobody gets blown away,
there you are, girls.

285
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:04,764
- Let's get some air.
- Hang onto those chairs!

286
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,613
They go nowhere.

287
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,614
Nothing moves here.

288
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,290
Screwed down for life.

289
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:24,212
Grandpa, I think it's time to go to bed.

290
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,974
Please, come.

291
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,738
They say it works both ways.

292
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:33,378
- You can either call in or you can listen.
- Fran, that's not ethical.

293
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:36,372
Okay, sex check.
I'm gonna try the Texan first.

294
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:38,818
Nothing.

295
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:40,810
Now we're gonna try your girl friend.

296
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,898
Disgusting!

297
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,819
I expected a little something.

298
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,256
You weren't that hot, darling.

299
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,290
Jerk!

300
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,415
Shit!

301
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:08,541
- Staying in shape, huh?
- Sure.

302
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,941
Your pecker's gotta last you
all your life, you know?

303
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,330
Sure.

304
00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:27,498
That breathing gets me.

305
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:32,258
I don't know whether you're dying
or trying to come.

306
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:38,622
John-O, next time it rains
come to see me.

307
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:54,259
- Franny!
- Come on, wake up.

308
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,705
- I just want to sleep.
- It's raining, dummy.

309
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,857
It's raining. It's your big day.

310
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,225
- It's raining!
- Stop it!

311
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:04,504
Come on, put on your shorts,
brush your teeth.

312
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,626
Don't be a chicken. Frank and I
have been up for hours.

313
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:10,386
- Brought you some money.
- What for?

314
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,265
So just in case she charges.

315
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:26,227
- What are you guys doing?
- Listen, we paid for. We get to listen.

316
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,427
We're just looking for you.

317
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:32,219
If you start to make a fool of yourself,
we'll call for a fire drill or something.

318
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:35,457
Oh, boy!

319
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,501
Hi. It's me.

320
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,977
It's raining. Remember?

321
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:10,465
Is it okay if I come in?

322
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,670
Were you expecting me?

323
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:40,223
That's how the worst germs
get spread. Mouth to mouth.

324
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,592
John-O.

325
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:31,158
It's customary to tip a waitress.

326
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:32,877
Oh, I forgot it.

327
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,477
I love the rain.

328
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,799
Franny won't understand.

329
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,760
Lilly and Egg are too young. There's
no point in asking their opinion.

330
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,120
I know he smells bad, but
it is not a fatal disease.

331
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,440
In a hotel it is!
That dog has terminal flatulence.

332
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,240
He's old.

333
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,949
Okay, but when you're old
we'll put you to sleep.

334
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,160
- That's it.
- Come on, old partner.

335
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,755
Easy go.

336
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:00,999
Grandpa'll be along soon.

337
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:07,398
One more fart and it's off to
the killers for me. I know that.

338
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:10,197
Jesus, we'll dump it all.

339
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:16,710
- Only Franny really loves the dog.
- That's not true.

340
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,073
She's the one who's really
gonna be upset.

341
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:32,714
Sorrow wasn't going to leave us
so easily.

342
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,720
We just didn't know how Sorrow
would return.

343
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,200
What's going on?

344
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,439
- The electricity went out.
- And it's Halloween!

345
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:56,965
They're out too.

346
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:59,445
Have the railroad station call
the phone company.

347
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,485
- Might be the main switch.
- Come on you two.

348
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,166
Let's switch on all the lights
in all the rooms.

349
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:07,326
The electricity is out.

350
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,526
It is now, but once the power comes
back on, the whole place will light up.

351
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:13,679
All right, we'll turn the radios
and everything electrical on.

352
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,237
It won't be long now.

353
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,724
Howard? I think he's had a heart attack.

354
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,440
Hello!

355
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,967
- I think he had a heart attack.
- Hello! Hello!

356
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,571
Don't do that! Hello!

357
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,010
I'll go get an ambulance. Come on
let's go get the school ambulance.

358
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:20,531
Hey, what's going on?

359
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,410
God, I hate Halloween. Come on.

360
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:39,134
Well, look who's here.
The nicest ass in school.

361
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,287
Howard Tuck had a heart attack.
We gotta get an ambulance!

362
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:44,734
We were all going to the infirmary
for an ambulance.

363
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,495
Do you know what I want
you to do, Franny?

364
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:49,815
I want you to show me that place.
That place where we can be alone.

365
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,252
- Remember?
- Franny, dammit!

366
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,405
Let him go. I'll show it to you now.

367
00:28:57,036 --> 00:29:00,533
- No, don't Franny!
- Shut up, blue stock boy! Shut up!

368
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:01,736
Franny, no!

369
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:05,253
Lenny, Chester and the rest are gonna
help you show me that place, okay?

370
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:08,772
Bastards! Cut it out!

371
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:11,257
We'll be back for you later, Harold.

372
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:14,125
- Don't worry, Harold.
- You'll get your turn.

373
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:19,537
I don't want no turn. I don't want
no trouble, all right?

374
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:21,177
You're already in trouble.

375
00:29:21,277 --> 00:29:23,853
You gotta help her. You've gotta
help my sister.

376
00:29:24,518 --> 00:29:26,778
- The hell with those guys, man.
- They're gonna rape her!

377
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,531
They're gonna rape her!

378
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:34,058
I know somebody who could fix
those mother fuckers, man.

379
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,491
What do you want? You wanna die?

380
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,655
You want to, don't you?

381
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,055
If somebody wants to die, I'll help him.

382
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,420
- Who wants to die first?
- We need your help now!

383
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,140
Hate rises!

384
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,701
Hey brother, don't you know?
Be happy in the fucking jungle!

385
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,501
- We need your help, Junior.
- You sure do!

386
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,095
They're raping her!

387
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,861
- Did you say rape, man?
- Yeah, man, rape, man.

388
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,535
My sister Franny.

389
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,130
Your sister?

390
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,502
Black arms of the law!

391
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:15,497
Junior had a sister, man.
And some dudes raped her one time.

392
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:17,343
And they hit her with an iron bar.

393
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:18,937
Black arms of the law!

394
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,411
Come on. Let's go, go!

395
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:23,172
Come on, move.

396
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,173
Come on, go, go!

397
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:32,217
It's right in here somewhere.

398
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:45,459
Franny!

399
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,789
It's just another Halloween, kid.

400
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,701
Hey, listen.

401
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,341
Do you know what?

402
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:14,110
When somebody touches you...

403
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:20,827
and you really don't wanna be touched,
that's not really being touched.

404
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,862
You still got you inside of you.

405
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,949
And nobody has touched you.

406
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:31,992
Not really.

407
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,349
You still got you inside of you.

408
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:41,190
- You believe that.
- I don't know.

409
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:56,275
No, I'm fine. I'll be okay.

410
00:32:56,736 --> 00:33:00,956
I wanna get some sleep and
I wanna take a bath.

411
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:02,476
You can have all the baths you want.

412
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:05,117
I want Sorrow to come and sleep
with me. Have you seen him?

413
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,475
- Sorrow? Sorrow?
- Come on.

414
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:11,031
Where is Sorrow?

415
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:13,025
What happened to him?

416
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,870
Call if you need me, honey.

417
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,796
Franny, can I get you anything?

418
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,630
Yesterday and most of today.

419
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,274
I love you.

420
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,842
They expelled them, John.
All they did was expel them.

421
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:06,552
I'd like to get my hands
on that Chipper Dove just once.

422
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:11,003
You oughta have a hundred pounds
on here, but I'm gonna start with 80.

423
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:12,392
Okay.

424
00:34:14,423 --> 00:34:16,156
- You got it?
- Yeah.

425
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:23,673
Can you imagine them trustees?

426
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:27,044
They actually suggested
we don't take any action

427
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:29,082
till after the Exeter game.

428
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:30,913
Shit!

429
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,562
I told them right out.

430
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:37,604
Be much better off losing the whole
backfield, than you were losing me

431
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,473
after what I would have done
to the little son-of-a-bitch.

432
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:44,320
I'd split his bag and run
his foot through it.

433
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,634
Then I get to think...

434
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,634
What's the point?

435
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,124
What's the point to all this now?

436
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:03,598
All right, take a break. Then
come back and do some more.

437
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,601
Thank God, you're taking an interest
in your body.

438
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,597
You're the first one in this family
who has done it.

439
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:26,802
What's up, Frank?

440
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,368
Jesus God, Frank!

441
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:32,009
Where did you get him?

442
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,799
I got him at the Vet's before
he was incinerated.

443
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,650
I'm gonna take him to the lab
and I'm gonna fix it for Franny

444
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,804
in time for Christmas.
I'm going to have Sorrow stuffed.

445
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:46,448
- I don't think she's gonna like it.
- Yes, she will. Don't tell anybody.

446
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,771
Where the hell's going Frank
with that garbage?

447
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:59,322
All the trash cans are full.

448
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:02,406
Damn fool must be going all the way
to the dump.

449
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,890
Jesus, that boy is queer.

450
00:36:08,352 --> 00:36:09,721
Okay, kid.

451
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:14,084
Do about ten of these. I'm gonna
get some water and I'll be right back.

452
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,244
'Get obsessed, stay obsessed',
Grandpa always said.

453
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:36,206
You're pushing yourself too hard.

454
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,965
Kid, it's not gonna happen again.
I promise you.

455
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:44,175
- Franny. You wanna go to the movies?
- Maybe.

456
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,564
Good.

457
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,332
Does Franny love Junior Jones?

458
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:55,965
She likes him.

459
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:57,731
He's a friend.

460
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:02,296
- How many days till Christmas?
- Ten.

461
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,938
Look what I bought for Mom.

462
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:04,938
She'll never wear it.

463
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:07,218
- What did you get for me?
- I'm not telling you.

464
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:08,607
Ooo, the hope.

465
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:10,373
Sorrow?

466
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:12,257
- Sorrow?
- It's Grandpa.

467
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:17,575
Don't look at me. Sorrow's still
in the lab. He's not finished yet.

468
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,539
The dog was here. Sorrow...

469
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,419
- He was here. He tried to kill me.
- No, you just had a nightmare, Pop.

470
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,889
I saw him.

471
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,053
He was here. I...

472
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,652
I could almost touch him.

473
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,053
That old rug's got so much dog hair,
your grandpa can still smell Sorrow.

474
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,537
Get back to you nap. That's it.
Go to sleep now.

475
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:54,175
Merry Christmas, Grandpa.

476
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:56,937
Merry Christmas.

477
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,140
I thought we'd lift some before
we open presents.

478
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,583
Take a day off, will you?
Jesus Christ, it's Christmas.

479
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,423
Merry Christmas.

480
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,703
Merry fucking Christmas.

481
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:17,172
Merry Christmas.

482
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:45,781
You can't stuff Sorrow and
you can't kill Sorrow.

483
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:50,141
This was the first death in our family.

484
00:38:51,086 --> 00:38:53,218
I couldn't get it out of my head.

485
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,617
I made me imagine the deaths
of the others.

486
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,781
How do you dry something that's wet?

487
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,983
What's wet, Egg?

488
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,699
Hair.

489
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,984
I wanna talk to you.

490
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,991
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

491
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:45,151
- Sorrow.
- Sorrow's dead.

492
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:48,827
Egg, I know he's dead.
I wanna know where he is.

493
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:51,626
Sorrow's with Grandpa Bob.

494
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:54,784
How would you dry hair?

495
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:57,072
How about a hair dryer?

496
00:39:57,172 --> 00:40:00,792
- One of those things that Franny has?
- Mom has one, too.

497
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:04,310
Yeah, but Franny's is bigger.
I bet you it's hotter too.

498
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:14,874
No one feels very much like
New Year's Eve

499
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,674
so let's not decorate or anything.

500
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:19,714
- A party's a party.
- Let's just have a good time.

501
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:22,854
Right. We've got a live band coming.

502
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,667
An almost live band.

503
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,668
Move that mike back, will you?
And don't be an asshole!

504
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,074
Hickeys!

505
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:42,035
How's Junior Jone's sister
getting back to Philadelphia?

506
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:44,836
- I guess she's got a car.
- A car?

507
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:46,476
That means she's older than I am.

508
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:50,357
Don't get so scared. It's reasonable
to assume she's black, too.

509
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:52,588
Welcome to the Hotel New Hampshire.

510
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:55,110
Here comes your main chance.

511
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:59,587
- Hi John-John.
- Hi, Titsie.

512
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:14,907
Hey, the fun is here.
Here's the fun, man.

513
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,194
Sabrina.

514
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:20,673
Your weight lifter.

515
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,228
Hi.

516
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,639
I thought you said Franny had
an older brother.

517
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:27,079
Hey, he's old enough.

518
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:28,719
There's gonna be a live band.

519
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,270
Oh, you don't say? Do you dance?

520
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,829
No.

521
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:35,716
That's Lilly.

522
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,361
Hello.

523
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,912
Hi. I'm a dwarf. I'm not ever
gonna grow any bigger.

524
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,675
That's interesting.

525
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,282
- That's Egg.
- Why do they call him Egg?

526
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:49,515
Because he began as an egg
and he's still an egg.

527
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:50,758
I see.

528
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:15,283
Jesus! How much are we paying them?

529
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:17,913
Don't worry. Everyone will have
a good time.

530
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:22,879
If we could start anew

531
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:26,838
I wouldn't hesitate.

532
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:30,678
I'd gladly take you back

533
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:35,044
and tempt the hand of fate.

534
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,317
Tears on my pillow.

535
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,995
Pain in my heart.

536
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:44,397
Caused by you.

537
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:54,200
Love is not a gadget.

538
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:56,727
Love is not a toy...

539
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:00,563
I know what you're thinking. My advice.

540
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:05,163
If you're gonna pull out on somebody,
tell them first.

541
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:06,918
Switch.

542
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:11,117
- Hi.
- Hi.

543
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:12,598
Sure it's fine.

544
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:18,049
You're not doing bad, John, really.

545
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:20,041
- Really?
- Yes. It's fine.

546
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:21,999
Thank you.

547
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,924
If you like that girl, why don't you
put a move on her?

548
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,730
I couldn't put a move on anyone.
I don't know how.

549
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,679
Well I'll be. Your sister is a slut.

550
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,530
And what about you?

551
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:45,170
You could introduce yourself
to Miss Tuck's affections by...

552
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,480
by offering to take her bags
up to her room.

553
00:43:51,352 --> 00:43:53,005
Where are your bags?

554
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,168
Well...

555
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,242
Good night.

556
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:06,163
You didn't even try to kiss me.

557
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:09,850
I'm sorry. I'm not into kissing yet.

558
00:44:10,754 --> 00:44:12,885
Never apologize.

559
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:17,970
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Now.

560
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:20,525
Watch the tooth contact.

561
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:23,614
And don't try to ram me with
your tongue. Okay?

562
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:25,368
- Okay.
- Okay.

563
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:27,804
I'm sorry.

564
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,048
Shit!

565
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:39,853
I always wanted to know how
it would feel to kiss without them.

566
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:52,371
- Do you like it?
- It's...

567
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:53,937
deeper.

568
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:55,975
Yes. But is it better?

569
00:45:02,238 --> 00:45:03,607
Yes.

570
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,487
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:08,174
Well, you are ready for Bitty.

572
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:13,933
- Go to it!
- Yes, ma'am.

573
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,219
Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five.

574
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,460
Four. Three. Two. One.

575
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,055
Happy New Year!

576
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:33,130
Switch.

577
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:37,975
Should old acquaintance be forgot

578
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:42,336
and never brought to mind.

579
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:47,653
Should old acquaintance be forgot...

580
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:52,010
- Where did you learn to do that?
- Come on, I'll show you.

581
00:45:58,482 --> 00:46:00,136
You okay?

582
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:11,182
You know, you could get a job
on television kissing like that.

583
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:14,333
Do it again.

584
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:18,535
I bet you can't. I bet it was
beginner's luck.

585
00:46:26,485 --> 00:46:28,059
Jesus!

586
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:30,820
Wait.

587
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:34,462
I have to use the washroom.

588
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:57,661
Bitty, Jesus Christ!

589
00:46:58,408 --> 00:47:00,266
These people are insane.

590
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,698
What's going on?

591
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:05,939
Fainted while diaphragming herself.

592
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:12,143
Bitty, wake up. Wake up.

593
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:14,949
It's just Sorrow, Bitty.

594
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:20,030
I tried to dry him up but he caught on
fire. I wanted to make him nice again.

595
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,979
Egg, Sorrow'll never be nice.
By definition Sorrow was not nice.

596
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:34,382
Hey, no offense to your sister,
but I'm very horny.

597
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,108
Ditto. No offense to yours.

598
00:47:39,612 --> 00:47:42,028
You wanna hit on those two girls
at the bar?

599
00:47:42,332 --> 00:47:43,951
I'm gonna pass.

600
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:03,342
Don't bother.

601
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,834
As soon as I handle this little problem,

602
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:08,464
I'll take a little walk in the moonlight
with you.

603
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:12,743
I'm sorry. I didn't want to spill it all.
I'll come up with you.

604
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:14,582
Wait a minute.

605
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,503
Yes.

606
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,917
I'm picking Sleazy up at this party.
You wanna come?

607
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:45,387
No. No, thank you.

608
00:48:45,497 --> 00:48:47,594
Chicken shit!

609
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:50,386
Kids today have no spunk!

610
00:48:51,817 --> 00:48:53,437
Squirrel dink!

611
00:48:53,858 --> 00:48:56,433
Good night, Miss Wales.
Thank you for the music.

612
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,600
Vienna?

613
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,800
- What do you know about Vienna?
- What did I know about motorcycles?

614
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,240
Or bears?

615
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,640
Freud says in his letter he's got
a new hotel.

616
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,680
And he wants us to come
and help him work it.

617
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,641
- Hi everybody.
- Hi, Junior.

618
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,521
- Hello, Junior.
- Hi Mrs. Berry, Mr. Berry.

619
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:28,910
How you doing?

620
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,241
- Good morning, Junior.
- Hi, Frank. How you doing?

621
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:34,601
- Hi, Junior.
- How you doing, love?

622
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,639
How did it go last night, Junior?

623
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:46,160
Franny, what do you think
about moving to Vienna?

624
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,670
I think it'll be more sophisticated
than staying here.

625
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:52,792
Well...

626
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:55,799
what am I gonna do without you?

627
00:49:56,304 --> 00:50:00,961
- You did okay last night.
- The pot calling the kettle black.

628
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:05,073
John?

629
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:09,475
- Take me to Vienna with you.
- I'll ask Pop.

630
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:12,003
No, you won't.

631
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,593
It doesn't matter.

632
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:21,399
What's the matter with you?

633
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,037
The kids will all be fucked up.

634
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:27,238
Who could be more fucked up
than them at Dairy School?

635
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:31,874
There's fucked up and there's
foreign and fucked up.

636
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,719
I'm really worried about Franny.

637
00:50:39,107 --> 00:50:40,601
She'll get over it.

638
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:43,606
Something must be bothering her.

639
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:47,044
She won't even think
of sleeping with me.

640
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:50,882
She's still young.

641
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:55,885
I wish you'd speak to her.

642
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:12,043
Hey kiddo, wake up, wake up.
You've had a bad dream.

643
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:14,801
Jesus God!

644
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,724
Why does Frank have to spring
the damn dog on everyone?

645
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:22,411
You see?

646
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:23,561
It's your friend.

647
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,844
- He's smiling.
- Yeah.

648
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:30,801
- I'm sorry, but I don't like Sorrow.
- You don't like him?

649
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:35,572
He's very real, Frank, but he's dead.
I don't find dead things amusing.

650
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:39,169
Maybe it's okay.
Can I take him to Vienna?

651
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,524
If we go. If we sell the hotel.

652
00:51:42,872 --> 00:51:44,321
I've sold it.

653
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:46,242
Honey! Well!

654
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:55,013
- Freud must be 100 years old now.
- You know what he always said.

655
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,373
'I just keep passing the open windows.'

656
00:51:57,473 --> 00:52:00,333
What does 'keep passing
the open windows' mean?

657
00:52:05,594 --> 00:52:08,125
Freud once told me this story.

658
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:11,129
Once this...

659
00:52:12,555 --> 00:52:15,528
There was this... street clown

660
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:18,491
called the King of Mocks.

661
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,650
Nobody seemed to have loved him in life

662
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:05,254
and now that he's dead,
everybody missed him.

663
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,855
Well, as Freud said,

664
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,739
'It's hard work

665
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,168
and great art

666
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,178
to make life not so serious.'

667
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:26,579
All right, bedtime.

668
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:29,014
- Good night.
- Good night.

669
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:30,856
Hey, kiddo.

670
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:35,012
What does 'keep passing
the open windows' mean?

671
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:38,935
It's just an expression that means
'keep on living' I guess.

672
00:53:39,243 --> 00:53:43,616
If you see an open window,
don't jump out. Good night.

673
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:50,181
I just don't know what it would mean
with Junior. Not yet.

674
00:53:51,443 --> 00:53:52,937
It just seems like...

675
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:55,461
as soon as someone gets to have you,

676
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:58,264
or some people get to have you,
you never hear from them at all.

677
00:53:58,364 --> 00:53:59,744
What do you mean?

678
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:03,064
I've not heard one word from
Chipper Dove, not a single word.

679
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:04,184
Can you imagine that?

680
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:06,064
I don't suppose you've written
to him either?

681
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:08,216
Yeah, twice. I think that's enough.

682
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:11,062
Why the fuck did you write him at all?

683
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:14,424
I was in love with him.

684
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:16,854
I mean, I still am.

685
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:19,854
Wait a minute.

686
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,096
Let's just say he fell in love with me.

687
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:30,096
Now if that happened, if he
fell in love with me,

688
00:54:31,047 --> 00:54:34,896
maybe I wouldn't love him any more.
Then I'd really get him.

689
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,057
- You know what, Franny?
- What?

690
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:41,022
I don't think we can get to Vienna
quick enough.

691
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,828
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- But I wanna go today.

692
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:48,308
No, you and I are gonna follow
in another plane tomorrow.

693
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:50,028
I've got a little to finish up here.

694
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:52,817
So when you arrive, everything
will be ready.

695
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:55,017
Come on.

696
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,656
Come on, it's okay.

697
00:54:57,609 --> 00:54:59,309
- I don't wanna leave.
- I know.

698
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:01,108
- I wanna go to...
- I know.

699
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:03,022
- I love you.
- I love you.

700
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:05,229
Bye, I love you.

701
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:07,666
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, darling.

702
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,419
Bye.

703
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:14,586
Bye, Dad.

704
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:16,710
Bye.

705
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:19,619
Bye.

706
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:22,547
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

707
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:24,823
Keep running, John-O.

708
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:29,226
Off we went in pursuit of a new hotel.

709
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:31,543
And arrived in Freud's Vienna.

710
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:41,941
Spooky.

711
00:55:42,052 --> 00:55:43,182
It's old.

712
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:19,790
Is that you?

713
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:22,390
Win Berry?

714
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:24,705
Over here.

715
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:42,147
You didn't know I was blind.
The Germans did that.

716
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:48,748
Hi.

717
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:52,552
Keep your hands to yourself, kid!

718
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:56,992
Susie is from Europe, but you do know
she went to college in New York?

719
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:59,276
She's very smart.

720
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:05,193
I went to Sarah Lawrence,
but I dropped out.

721
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,800
What an elitist crock of shit!

722
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:13,240
She was the only bear I could find
who was really smart.

723
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:18,191
Now we have a grand hotel.
Now we're gonna have a future.

724
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:23,111
But we gotta get organized.
We gotta move everyone around.

725
00:57:23,302 --> 00:57:24,242
Who's everyone?

726
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:27,110
The whores. The radicals.

727
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:31,802
Already you Americans change
your hotel to suit you.

728
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:34,477
We need this floor for guests who pay.

729
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:37,873
Moving downstairs will be
better for you.

730
00:57:38,263 --> 00:57:40,201
- Let me give you a hand.
- No!

731
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:42,152
No.

732
00:57:42,823 --> 00:57:45,353
That guy is weird. Susie,
don't go out with him.

733
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:48,883
I don't go out with men, honey.

734
00:57:48,983 --> 00:57:51,878
- If you want to help you can help.
- They all have code names.

735
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:55,602
And that one is Miss Miscarriage.

736
00:57:56,024 --> 00:57:58,684
She's never had sex.
That's their idea of humor.

737
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:00,073
Sorry.

738
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,279
Thank you.

739
00:58:05,744 --> 00:58:07,603
"The Great Gatsby". Do you like it?

740
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,406
So, what exactly are your politics?

741
00:58:14,506 --> 00:58:19,516
- Change fucking everything.
- To root out all that's rotten.

742
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:23,719
That guy looks like Chipper Dove.

743
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:28,922
You're an animal! You represent
the compromise!

744
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:31,487
- You are crazy!
- Americans are spying us.

745
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:34,355
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up!

746
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:39,881
And fuck you too!

747
00:58:41,868 --> 00:58:43,848
I didn't like the way that guy
looked at you.

748
00:58:43,948 --> 00:58:45,681
They are all so scary.

749
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:48,637
They look straight at you,
but don't even see you.

750
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:51,559
There's gonna be sex and violence.

751
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:55,208
I hear the girls coming in for work.

752
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,330
- Good morning.
- That's Babette.

753
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,482
- Good morning.
- Dark Inga.

754
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,930
- Her mother. Screaming Annie.
- Good morning.

755
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,925
Screaming Annie's got the best
fake orgasm in the business.

756
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,646
I don't think Mother's gonna
like it here.

757
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:43,805
What went wrong went wrong quickly.

758
00:59:47,914 --> 00:59:49,727
Sorrow floats too.

759
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:53,334
It was when Mother and Egg were gone

760
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:56,294
that we knew we really were
in a foreign country.

761
01:00:00,715 --> 01:00:03,688
There's no point.
That's the whole point.

762
01:00:04,195 --> 01:00:06,486
You get on a plane and it doesn't crash.

763
01:00:06,835 --> 01:00:09,895
That means you got on
the right plane. That's all it means.

764
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:15,848
From now on I'm gonna be mother.
I'm gonna take care of you and you...

765
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:20,015
I wanna grow up. I wanna change.

766
01:00:21,636 --> 01:00:23,928
I'm gonna stop swearing.

767
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:26,450
You're not gonna say 'fuck',

768
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:31,258
'shit' or 'cocksucker', 'Ln your ear',
'out your ass', anything any more?

769
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:33,649
- That's right.
- It would have pleased Mother.

770
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:36,527
Oh, great.

771
01:00:36,878 --> 01:00:38,658
Beat your meat all night and dream
of tits,

772
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:40,778
but you wanna sound nice, is that it?

773
01:00:40,878 --> 01:00:43,818
- Don't bitch, Franny.
- You're as queer as the cat's fart.

774
01:00:43,918 --> 01:00:45,652
And what are you, honey?

775
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:48,059
What makes you think you are so tough?

776
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:50,575
I'm not so tough, but I'm smart.

777
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:53,379
You? You'd rather be a dumb bear
than a human being.

778
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:55,929
And you are beautiful,
but you're a bitch.

779
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,290
We offer you our revolutionary
sympathies.

780
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:12,781
We are all victims of the greed of
the capitalist flying corporation.

781
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,899
We suffer with your suffering.

782
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:18,933
But from now on you will be our kinder.

783
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:23,861
Little Yankee, go home.

784
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:55,663
Pop, we wanna go home. No way here.

785
01:01:56,325 --> 01:01:59,264
- We miss home.
- It's not gonna work here, Pop.

786
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:00,745
It's the best time we do it.

787
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:04,502
For school and before we all
have our various commitments.

788
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:10,135
With a successful hotel,
we can afford to leave, but...

789
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:14,100
I'm afraid that we wouldn't have
anything to leave with.

790
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:15,775
You mean money?

791
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:18,626
You mean you've already sunk
the money in here?

792
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:19,867
Unsink the money, Pop.

793
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,307
We should leave whether
it's sunk or unsunk.

794
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,106
No place to go.

795
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,982
Going no place is better
than staying here.

796
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,456
Franny.

797
01:02:37,008 --> 01:02:38,583
Franny, what do you think?

798
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:42,508
I think we should stay.

799
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,463
Try it out.

800
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,298
Atta girl, Franny.

801
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:51,390
'Gatsby believed in the green light.

802
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:56,420
The orgiastic future that year by year
recedes before us.

803
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:01,542
It eluded us then, but that's no matter.

804
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,904
Tomorrow we will run faster.

805
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:08,504
Stretch out our arms farther.

806
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,306
And one fine morning,

807
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:18,540
so we beat on, boats
against the current,

808
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:22,584
borne back ceaselessly into the past.'

809
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:27,582
Well, I don't know...

810
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:30,586
only somehow...

811
01:03:32,133 --> 01:03:36,870
it's against my politics, but it
makes me want to go to the US.

812
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:39,152
I wish we'd never left.

813
01:03:40,854 --> 01:03:42,553
Lilly, what is it?

814
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:46,268
It's Father.

815
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:48,947
He is a Gatsby.

816
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:51,710
- Lilly, don't...
- Yes, I know he is.

817
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:54,955
He's always gonna be chasing
after some 'it',

818
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:57,471
and it's always gonna get away.

819
01:03:57,895 --> 01:04:01,744
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

820
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:07,555
Good, good. Thank you. Thank you.

821
01:04:07,655 --> 01:04:09,355
Thank you everybody!

822
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:12,553
What the fuck else could Pop call it?

823
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:23,474
Capitalism at its worst!

824
01:04:24,097 --> 01:04:25,990
I think it's sweet.

825
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:28,478
I think changing the name
hasn't changed anything.

826
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:32,238
It's not the place for you, Lilly.
You must find another home.

827
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:36,028
One. Two. Three. Go!

828
01:04:43,899 --> 01:04:49,227
All sexual acts actually involve
four or five different sexes.

829
01:04:49,379 --> 01:04:50,879
Wait a minute, that means

830
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:55,034
that for every one fuck there are
four or five people going at it?

831
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,993
That sounds exhausting.

832
01:04:57,781 --> 01:05:01,521
I'm a pornographer because
I'm serving the revolution.

833
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:04,921
Everything that is decadent
speeds up the revolution.

834
01:05:05,021 --> 01:05:08,361
Today, at this phase, it's necessary
to generate disgust.

835
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:10,513
You're certainly doing
a good job of that.

836
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:16,520
Disgust in ourselves and what we have
allowed ourselves to become.

837
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,400
Speaking for himself.

838
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,800
The pornographer is of course
the most disgusting.

839
01:05:24,582 --> 01:05:27,601
- I thought you were a Communist.
- Personally...

840
01:05:28,142 --> 01:05:31,003
Well, personally I'm an aesthete.

841
01:05:32,823 --> 01:05:37,560
I long for the erotic.
I mourn for the erotic.

842
01:05:38,503 --> 01:05:41,477
For in the new world, after
the revolution,

843
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:44,712
all this must be lost.

844
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:46,634
The new world?

845
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:51,436
Keep passing the open windows.

846
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,161
We gotta help her.

847
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,798
Franny is real tough.

848
01:06:05,826 --> 01:06:08,326
She's beautiful and she's tough.
She doesn't need anybody.

849
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:12,844
She likes you. You're like an older
sister to her, so you could help her.

850
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:17,247
- Help Franny from whom?
- Ernst.

851
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:23,807
I don't usually mess around with
underage girls.

852
01:06:23,907 --> 01:06:27,006
I'm not asking you to mess around
with her, but to help her.

853
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:31,243
Helping...

854
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:35,806
Helping someone is the same thing
as messing with someone.

855
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:42,284
Good afternoon.

856
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:47,366
- The thing never runs.
- He's always trying to fix it, too.

857
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:36,494
Hey, you guys, you look like
you've seen a ghost.

858
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,014
What's the matter, your hard-ons
keep you awake?

859
01:07:39,114 --> 01:07:40,974
It's too hot to fuck anyway.

860
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:43,808
- Never too hot.
- Never too cold.

861
01:07:50,114 --> 01:07:52,326
I guess I'll have to go queer now.

862
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:57,285
No, John, I don't think
it works like that.

863
01:07:59,036 --> 01:08:01,054
I'm convinced, you know.

864
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:07,297
But I think Franny's only doing it for
Susie, because Susie's so insecure.

865
01:08:08,397 --> 01:08:10,737
You know Franny, she's open to anything.

866
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,857
And in Kamasutra there are
many positions.

867
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:17,057
One of the more interesting
is the "vyanta",

868
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:18,777
the cow position.

869
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:21,407
The woman leans forward and...

870
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:37,938
Franny, what are you doing?

871
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:40,900
I just want Susie to understand
that I can't go on with her any more.

872
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,100
Don't give me that crap!

873
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,094
You dropped her so hard
she's becoming a bear again.

874
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,012
You just don't understand. I love you.

875
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,659
I love you too.

876
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,413
What are we gonna do about it?

877
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:56,379
We're not gonna do anything about it.

878
01:08:57,361 --> 01:08:59,501
We're just gonna love each other
that's all.

879
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:00,970
Not ever?

880
01:09:06,161 --> 01:09:07,381
May I help you?

881
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:11,102
We're looking for some clean, plain
honest-to-goodness decency.

882
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,782
- We've been robbed all over Europe.
- I can't wait to go home.

883
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:15,382
We've been through all the tour books,

884
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:18,142
but you just can't believe
anything you read any more.

885
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,142
We're looking for some American touches.

886
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:21,662
I'm sure we can fix you right up.

887
01:09:21,762 --> 01:09:24,337
You won't believe some
of the filth we've been...

888
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:29,863
What the hell is it?

889
01:09:30,284 --> 01:09:31,664
It took her a long time to...

890
01:09:31,764 --> 01:09:34,704
I came from in there. If you don't have
the guts to go in there, I will.

891
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,544
- Oh, you will?
- Well it's clearly a murder.

892
01:09:36,644 --> 01:09:38,582
Just relax. I want you to relax.

893
01:09:45,045 --> 01:09:46,825
He passed out on me.

894
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:48,419
Will you move?

895
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:54,180
- What's wrong with that?
- It's okay.

896
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:57,499
- It' was just an orgasm.
- Orgasm?

897
01:09:58,046 --> 01:10:00,735
Haven't you ever had one, for Chrissake?

898
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:05,066
- Are these your children?
- Yes, some of them.

899
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,786
You should be ashamed. Exposing
them to this sordid life...

900
01:10:07,886 --> 01:10:09,539
It's disgusting.

901
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:12,946
I have just the man to show you
what's "disgusting", lady.

902
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:28,145
After all that, I could use some
fresh air. I'm gonna pick my coat.

903
01:10:37,249 --> 01:10:39,267
It's a skimpy dress, Franny.

904
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:43,217
I'm not going out.

905
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,658
Dad, let's get out of here.

906
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:02,621
We were outside the Opera.
The famous Vienna Opera.

907
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:05,783
And I couldn't get Franny
out of my mind.

908
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:10,828
Love floats, too, just like Sorrow.

909
01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:13,350
I'm gonna get you a drink.

910
01:11:26,293 --> 01:11:29,061
- Good evening, Leo.
- Good evening, Mr. Berry.

911
01:11:29,253 --> 01:11:31,353
- What is it, John?
- Beer.

912
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,222
A beer, and the usual
for you, Mr. Berry?

913
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:39,584
- Bye, Mr. Berry.
- Bye.

914
01:11:45,215 --> 01:11:47,392
I didn't know you hung out here, Pop.

915
01:11:48,456 --> 01:11:51,748
Yes, this was how it was all
supposed to be.

916
01:11:53,896 --> 01:11:55,311
Thanks.

917
01:11:56,256 --> 01:11:58,467
Your mother would have loved all this.

918
01:12:03,977 --> 01:12:05,346
Toast.

919
01:12:16,657 --> 01:12:17,992
I'm afraid I've...

920
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:23,431
I've let you all down.

921
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,559
You haven't, Pop.

922
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:28,553
John, I'm a failure.

923
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:34,919
So now it's off to 'the land
of the free'.

924
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,394
And no more hotels.
I'm gonna to get a job.

925
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,792
- Maybe we'll all have to get jobs.
- It's okay.

926
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,599
It won't be so bad.

927
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,954
Human beings are remarkable

928
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,352
at what we can learn to live with.

929
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:56,561
If we can't get strong
from what we lose,

930
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:58,921
what we miss,

931
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,312
what we want and can't have...

932
01:13:10,863 --> 01:13:13,518
then we could never get
strong enough, could we?

933
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,875
But, what else makes us strong?

934
01:13:23,144 --> 01:13:24,559
Oh, sorry.

935
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:33,599
Good night, John.

936
01:13:55,426 --> 01:13:57,046
She's with Ernst.

937
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:00,841
- I love her too.
- Not like I do!

938
01:14:00,987 --> 01:14:02,561
Just like you do!

939
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:15,925
I found out about everything.

940
01:14:17,268 --> 01:14:18,717
What do you want to know?

941
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,401
You wanna know about everything?

942
01:14:35,549 --> 01:14:38,809
Do you wanna know about
the cow position or the elephant one?

943
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,528
The main point is it hurts.

944
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,009
- Do you want me to go on?
- No.

945
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:50,330
Do you still love me?

946
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,410
I can't help it.

947
01:14:56,431 --> 01:14:58,006
Poor you.

948
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:03,371
Poor you, too.

949
01:15:06,112 --> 01:15:08,732
While we were stuck in
our hopeless loves,

950
01:15:08,832 --> 01:15:10,252
Lilly had a mission.

951
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:13,332
If she couldn't grow in life,
she'd grow in her imagination.

952
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:15,007
It's a novel.

953
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:17,810
It's a little autobiographical.

954
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:21,446
It's called 'Trying to Grow'.

955
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:26,054
I can't wait. I bet I come off
a real loon.

956
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:30,448
- No. Everyone's a hero.
- We're all heroes?

957
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:33,769
Well, you are all heroes to me.

958
01:15:34,915 --> 01:15:37,695
- Even Susie?
- Of course Susie.

959
01:15:37,795 --> 01:15:40,055
She's afraid of simply be a human being

960
01:15:40,155 --> 01:15:42,525
and after deal with other human beings.

961
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:44,929
You're gonna need an agent.

962
01:15:45,035 --> 01:15:46,371
Well...

963
01:15:46,756 --> 01:15:48,967
isn't that what you've always
wanted to be?

964
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:55,127
But others had a mission too.

965
01:15:55,596 --> 01:15:57,887
A mission leading to a mystery.

966
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,328
What do you want?

967
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,818
I'm checking the fuses.

968
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,539
Power's out upstairs.

969
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,173
Good morning, John.

970
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:51,461
Not Schwanger. She's the mother type.
What'd she be doing with a gun?

971
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:52,930
How would I know?

972
01:16:55,281 --> 01:16:57,422
I'll tell you something else
that's weird.

973
01:16:57,522 --> 01:17:00,336
Miss Miscarriage asked me
to come up to her apartment.

974
01:17:00,442 --> 01:17:02,414
- Yeah?
- Do you think she likes me?

975
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:20,092
You should go.

976
01:17:20,324 --> 01:17:21,943
- Now?
- No.

977
01:17:22,124 --> 01:17:25,424
Now is not necessary
that you go. Come in.

978
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:27,177
I will lock the door.

979
01:17:32,644 --> 01:17:34,138
Please, leave.

980
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:38,461
Just leave the Hotel New Hampshire.

981
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:40,657
- The what?
- From Vienna.

982
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:43,940
And make sure Lilly,
especially Lilly leaves.

983
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:48,102
- What are you talking about?
- We're going to blow up the Opera.

984
01:17:48,686 --> 01:17:50,180
Get your family out.

985
01:17:51,486 --> 01:17:54,745
Especially Lilly, little Lilly.

986
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:58,985
- You'll have to come with us.
- I can't.

987
01:17:59,527 --> 01:18:00,896
Why not?

988
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:07,023
Because I drive the car. And
in the car is a bomb.

989
01:18:07,528 --> 01:18:10,706
It sets off the main bomb in the Opera.

990
01:18:11,088 --> 01:18:12,616
You'll be killed.

991
01:18:14,848 --> 01:18:16,297
I'm expendable.

992
01:18:16,888 --> 01:18:19,258
It's the hostages part I don't like.

993
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:20,908
What hostages?

994
01:18:21,008 --> 01:18:23,618
You and your family, because
you're Americans.

995
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:30,778
Because Americans make
great publicity as hostages.

996
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:33,579
- Please, you've got to get away.
- Come with us.

997
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,582
Will you do something for me?

998
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:40,500
What?

999
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,550
Please, fuck me.

1000
01:18:47,531 --> 01:18:49,708
I just want to feel it one time.

1001
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:06,349
- Do you have any protection?
- It doesn't matter.

1002
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:08,267
Why not?

1003
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:12,392
Because I'll be dead before
the baby is born.

1004
01:19:14,534 --> 01:19:15,983
Am I the first?

1005
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:19,667
You're the first...

1006
01:19:20,534 --> 01:19:21,983
and the last.

1007
01:19:23,654 --> 01:19:25,910
Do everything to me.

1008
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:45,551
Is that it? Is that everything?

1009
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:47,745
You want more?

1010
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:53,664
Not especially.

1011
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,391
I just wanted to have it done
it all once.

1012
01:20:01,298 --> 01:20:05,637
If we have done it all,
you must get back.

1013
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:09,513
You should go.

1014
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:14,468
You must leave today or tomorrow.

1015
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:17,951
Take Lilly with you. Give Lilly my love.

1016
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,707
Make sure she hears from me.

1017
01:20:24,139 --> 01:20:25,633
Say goodbye.

1018
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:46,762
John, where have you been?
We've been trying to find you.

1019
01:20:46,862 --> 01:20:48,362
Listen, Lilly is gonna get published.

1020
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:50,442
This publisher in New York
is gonna buy her book.

1021
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:52,282
- Listen.
- Frank is gonna negotiate the deal.

1022
01:20:52,382 --> 01:20:54,400
- What?
- They're gonna blow the Opera.

1023
01:20:54,502 --> 01:20:55,442
Who's they?

1024
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:57,958
- The radicals.
- What are you talking about?

1025
01:21:03,823 --> 01:21:05,238
March!

1026
01:21:11,263 --> 01:21:12,916
What dream is this?

1027
01:21:15,183 --> 01:21:16,598
Line up!

1028
01:21:18,384 --> 01:21:19,924
So explain yourselves.

1029
01:21:20,024 --> 01:21:23,484
It's quite simple to explain.
We have two bombs.

1030
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:25,684
The big bomb will explode in the Opera.

1031
01:21:25,784 --> 01:21:27,445
Of course, it won't kill everyone,

1032
01:21:27,545 --> 01:21:29,925
just the people in the front seats,
the orchestra.

1033
01:21:30,025 --> 01:21:34,406
But the big bomb has to be set off
by a little bomb...

1034
01:21:34,506 --> 01:21:35,646
in the car.

1035
01:21:35,746 --> 01:21:38,206
I drive to the Opera, then I get out.

1036
01:21:38,306 --> 01:21:42,726
Then other driver gets in the car,
counts ten, floors it, pop, zing, boom!

1037
01:21:42,826 --> 01:21:44,166
So we need a driver.

1038
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,326
- I'll drive.
- No, you can't.

1039
01:21:45,426 --> 01:21:47,446
If one of us has to drive,
I'm much better driver.

1040
01:21:47,546 --> 01:21:50,327
I swear to God if you make
my father to drive, I'll kill you, Ernst.

1041
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:52,479
We don't want to hurt
your father, Franny.

1042
01:21:52,947 --> 01:21:55,807
It's me. I'm the driver.

1043
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:58,567
And if you fuck it up,
we shoot them all.

1044
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:01,800
How can a blind man drive a car,
you morons?

1045
01:22:01,987 --> 01:22:04,808
Most terrorists fail because
they take hostages,

1046
01:22:04,908 --> 01:22:06,848
but they only threaten with violence.

1047
01:22:06,948 --> 01:22:09,448
But we are beginning with the violence.

1048
01:22:09,548 --> 01:22:13,808
It's a necessary phase.
Like you were, Franny.

1049
01:22:16,149 --> 01:22:18,007
You slept with Ernst, Franny?

1050
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:20,238
Sorry.

1051
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:24,043
- It was a necessary phase.
- Don't move!

1052
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:30,162
My daughter was a necessary phase?

1053
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:36,043
Get back! Get back!
Stand back, stand back.

1054
01:22:37,071 --> 01:22:38,486
Is he dead?

1055
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:40,801
Forget him.

1056
01:22:41,151 --> 01:22:43,646
One hitch can spoil our plan.

1057
01:22:43,991 --> 01:22:48,079
- You don't have to drive the car.
- Of course I have to do it, Win Berry.

1058
01:22:52,872 --> 01:22:54,491
Goodbye, little Lilly.

1059
01:22:57,432 --> 01:22:59,246
Goodbye, Sussie dear.

1060
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:03,050
You're a prince, Frank.

1061
01:23:04,153 --> 01:23:05,363
Goodbye, Franny.

1062
01:23:07,073 --> 01:23:09,729
Bye, weight lifter.

1063
01:23:13,594 --> 01:23:15,486
I love you, Win Berry.

1064
01:23:16,314 --> 01:23:19,526
And I'm sorry that I got you
into the hotel business.

1065
01:23:27,395 --> 01:23:29,014
I don't need your assistance.

1066
01:23:32,555 --> 01:23:36,535
- Just let me feel the fender.
- No, in here! Where are you going?

1067
01:23:36,635 --> 01:23:39,165
- Yes, here it's is the headlight, right?
- You fool!

1068
01:23:40,476 --> 01:23:41,367
No!

1069
01:23:46,397 --> 01:23:48,767
Hold still, Pop. Hold still.

1070
01:23:49,677 --> 01:23:52,127
Easy. Easy. Easy.

1071
01:23:54,157 --> 01:23:56,298
- It's gonna be all right.
- I can't see.

1072
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:59,371
- Pop?
- I can't see.

1073
01:25:12,003 --> 01:25:15,105
The American publishers paid
a lot of money for Lilly's book.

1074
01:25:15,205 --> 01:25:18,656
Maybe they wouldn't have if we hadn't
been famous for saving the Opera

1075
01:25:18,885 --> 01:25:23,224
and murdering the terrorists in our
good American family kind of way.

1076
01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:27,581
- This is just like a fairy tale.
- You mean we're going to be rich?

1077
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:31,146
Yeah, Pop, you can have anything
you want. It's all yours. Here you go.

1078
01:25:31,246 --> 01:25:35,016
Back home a football injury
started Junior on a new career.

1079
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:37,186
I sure miss football, though.

1080
01:25:37,286 --> 01:25:39,463
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1081
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:45,346
Hey, why don't you tell your father
I'll trade him my knees for his eyes.

1082
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:47,658
Yeah, what are you gonna give me
for my knees?

1083
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:48,747
To Lilly.

1084
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:50,216
To Lilly.

1085
01:25:52,887 --> 01:25:55,747
Anything you need just call
Room Service.

1086
01:25:55,847 --> 01:25:57,987
Lilly's publishers are picking up
the bills.

1087
01:25:58,087 --> 01:25:58,948
Room Service?

1088
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:01,188
I've never been in a hotel
with room service before.

1089
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:05,389
Frank. Is Franny gonna get that part
in the movie of Lilly's book?

1090
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:08,629
Most certainly. With a good agent,
you have the world by the balls.

1091
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:11,069
I just set up a three book contract
for Lilly.

1092
01:26:11,169 --> 01:26:14,063
That's the problem. I'm lucky now.

1093
01:26:14,289 --> 01:26:17,501
But I've gotta keep growing.
I gotta get better.

1094
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:20,146
My next book has to be even bigger.

1095
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:21,670
Just coast for a while.

1096
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,910
The cash flow is terrifically liquid.

1097
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,790
I'd like to live her forever.

1098
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,101
Just so long as you have a chaperone.

1099
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,826
You know who I need a chaperone from?

1100
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,625
You and Franny have a bomb between you.

1101
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:43,792
One day it's gonna blow you away,
unless you do something about it.

1102
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:47,184
One day we're going to have to do
something about the bear in you.

1103
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:51,022
Well...

1104
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:52,742
Look who's here.

1105
01:26:53,813 --> 01:26:55,753
I've enjoyed hearing from Franny.

1106
01:26:55,853 --> 01:26:58,508
- Who's Franny?
- She's my sister.

1107
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:00,553
Your friend here raped her.

1108
01:27:00,653 --> 01:27:03,553
- He and a bunch of guys.
- Oh, no!

1109
01:27:03,653 --> 01:27:06,593
Listen, I'll explain it to you later.
All right?

1110
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:11,313
Is Franny here too?

1111
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:13,787
Yes, she's in New York.

1112
01:27:14,934 --> 01:27:16,064
She is?

1113
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:18,232
Tell her I'd like to see her.

1114
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,234
Why do you wanna see her?

1115
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:23,866
Well, to apologize.
Amongst other things.

1116
01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:26,715
Why don't you go and see her yourself?

1117
01:27:26,815 --> 01:27:30,506
- She's at the Ritz Carlton.
- Franny's staying at the Ritz Carlton?

1118
01:27:30,776 --> 01:27:32,395
They own the hotel.

1119
01:27:33,056 --> 01:27:36,357
I'll definitely call.
Well, must be going.

1120
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:38,349
Can't keep the lady waiting.

1121
01:27:39,497 --> 01:27:41,867
Why the fuck did you tell him
where she was?

1122
01:27:44,257 --> 01:27:46,787
Because at last she can deal with him.

1123
01:27:48,177 --> 01:27:52,186
How can I go outside? He could be
waiting for me. He could be anywhere.

1124
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,316
He's not gonna hurt you again.

1125
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,751
Of course you're afraid.

1126
01:27:58,058 --> 01:28:00,678
But once you get over the fear,
you can get to the anger,

1127
01:28:00,778 --> 01:28:02,397
and then you're home free.

1128
01:28:02,738 --> 01:28:05,678
He called me up today. I couldn't say
anything. I couldn't even talk to him.

1129
01:28:05,778 --> 01:28:07,358
Lilly had to talk to him.

1130
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,078
He's coming tomorrow.

1131
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:12,951
So what do you wanna do, Franny?

1132
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,920
I wanna kill Chipper Dove.
The bastard, I wanna kill him.

1133
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,080
What a girl, Franny!

1134
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:22,313
- The super shit of a human being.
- Give me a day.

1135
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,031
What for?

1136
01:28:24,421 --> 01:28:27,189
The script. I've got a great idea.

1137
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:34,070
Miss Berry is all ready for you.
Right this way.

1138
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:37,990
We are all so grateful
that you could come.

1139
01:28:45,142 --> 01:28:46,636
Hi, Franny.

1140
01:28:48,102 --> 01:28:52,520
You see, when you touched the her
in her, you broke her heart.

1141
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:56,872
And that's why it was so important
that you came,

1142
01:28:57,383 --> 01:29:00,437
because if we could touch
the you in you,

1143
01:29:00,744 --> 01:29:03,558
then maybe the shock might bring
her back.

1144
01:29:07,104 --> 01:29:08,684
Well, look who's here.

1145
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:11,918
- Hey, hey, what's all this?
- I'll take care of him.

1146
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:13,525
We're gonna rape you.

1147
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,365
Not me. I only fuck mud puddles.
I do it all the time.

1148
01:29:16,465 --> 01:29:18,405
No, don't look at me. You're not
gonna fuck me.

1149
01:29:18,505 --> 01:29:20,602
I got somebody who wants to meet you.

1150
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,604
Stop it! Stop it!

1151
01:29:51,788 --> 01:29:54,648
Go on, Chipper, put your pants back
and get outta here!

1152
01:29:57,148 --> 01:29:59,969
The next time you take your pants off
for anybody, think of Franny.

1153
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:01,358
Remember us.

1154
01:30:02,309 --> 01:30:04,327
It's enough, all of you!

1155
01:30:04,629 --> 01:30:06,521
Just go! Go!

1156
01:30:07,309 --> 01:30:08,724
Just get out!

1157
01:30:10,549 --> 01:30:13,841
What's the matter, Franny?
Didn't you like my play?

1158
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,478
It's not that, Lilly.

1159
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:24,328
He just meant so much to me
so many years.

1160
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,040
At least I thought he did anyway.

1161
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:31,092
It's all this dumb revenge stuff.

1162
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:32,641
It's just...

1163
01:30:33,072 --> 01:30:35,408
It's just one big let down.

1164
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:38,732
As far as I'm concerned, nothing
we could do to Chipper Dove

1165
01:30:38,832 --> 01:30:40,963
would be as awful as what he did to you.

1166
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:45,326
Just think of it this way, Franny.
It was a fairy tale.

1167
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:49,249
You were lost in the woods and
then you suddenly find the way out.

1168
01:30:49,713 --> 01:30:52,004
Isn't that what growing is all about?

1169
01:30:53,113 --> 01:30:54,528
That's it.

1170
01:30:56,113 --> 01:30:57,971
It's all over now.

1171
01:30:59,073 --> 01:31:01,125
Now there's a new ballgame.

1172
01:31:01,834 --> 01:31:05,214
But in a fairy tale when you think
you're outta the woods,

1173
01:31:05,314 --> 01:31:07,127
sometimes you're still in them.

1174
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:12,932
Miss Berry, did you always dream
about writing a book?

1175
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:16,571
Well, yes, that's all. And...

1176
01:31:17,155 --> 01:31:18,730
I'll get you a drink.

1177
01:31:18,996 --> 01:31:20,376
A dream...

1178
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:24,815
is the disguises fulfillment
of a suppressed wish.

1179
01:31:25,116 --> 01:31:28,647
What was one of your dreams?
When my mother was...

1180
01:31:29,316 --> 01:31:31,129
Do you know what my dream is?

1181
01:31:31,836 --> 01:31:34,173
But there's a difference between
you and me.

1182
01:31:34,477 --> 01:31:37,291
I'm gonna get over you, but you're
not gonna get over me.

1183
01:31:37,397 --> 01:31:39,255
Not without your help anyway.

1184
01:31:40,277 --> 01:31:43,489
...and I had the feeling it was
all fixed up.

1185
01:31:44,157 --> 01:31:46,857
Restored. A brand new hotel.

1186
01:31:46,957 --> 01:31:49,298
And you owned it, I bet.
Two white wines.

1187
01:31:49,398 --> 01:31:52,053
You said that I can do anything,
didn't Frank?

1188
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:55,090
You really wanna do it again?

1189
01:31:56,398 --> 01:31:58,338
You really wanna start all over again?

1190
01:31:58,438 --> 01:32:01,856
- Do you realize you don't have to?
- What else would I do?

1191
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:05,452
I love you. I'm sorry but I do.

1192
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,937
I love you too. Terribly.

1193
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,698
One day we'll have to.

1194
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,136
John-O, Lilly's out having
a literary lunch.

1195
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,816
Get your ass over here, kid,
it's now or never.

1196
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:33,574
You are a sweaty bitty.
Come on, take a shower.

1197
01:32:38,082 --> 01:32:39,735
Jesus God!

1198
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:42,342
- Your balls are all wet.
- I dried myself.

1199
01:32:42,442 --> 01:32:45,143
- Yeah, but you missed your balls.
- What's wrong with wet balls?

1200
01:32:45,243 --> 01:32:47,056
Nothing to Kamasutra.

1201
01:32:49,763 --> 01:32:54,904
Well, that was okay. It wasn't great
but it was nice. Right?

1202
01:32:55,004 --> 01:32:57,374
- It was better than nice.
- Yeah?

1203
01:32:57,804 --> 01:32:59,981
Get ready for great.

1204
01:33:02,964 --> 01:33:05,504
Go away. Come back in an hour.

1205
01:33:05,604 --> 01:33:08,024
- Why?
- I'm writing something.

1206
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,098
- No, you're not.
- I'm trying to grow.

1207
01:33:11,605 --> 01:33:14,703
Okay. Keep passing the open windows.

1208
01:33:15,165 --> 01:33:17,183
I still want you.

1209
01:33:17,685 --> 01:33:18,705
Are you sore?

1210
01:33:18,805 --> 01:33:22,425
Of course I'm sore. But you better
not stop.

1211
01:33:22,525 --> 01:33:24,224
If you stop I'll kill you.

1212
01:33:31,447 --> 01:33:33,627
- Go away!
- Come back in an hour.

1213
01:33:33,727 --> 01:33:36,667
It's nine o'clock. I've been away
for five hours.

1214
01:33:36,767 --> 01:33:40,663
- Go have dinner with Frank.
- I had lunch with Frank.

1215
01:33:48,408 --> 01:33:50,228
- That was a good one.
- Yes.

1216
01:33:50,328 --> 01:33:51,868
- Franny?
- Yes?

1217
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:54,148
We have to stop. We're gonna
hurt each other.

1218
01:33:54,248 --> 01:33:57,429
No, my love, that's exactly what
we're not gonna do, hurt each other.

1219
01:33:57,529 --> 01:33:59,269
We're gonna be just fine.

1220
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:01,149
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1221
01:34:01,249 --> 01:34:02,989
- I'm finished.
- No, almost finished.

1222
01:34:03,089 --> 01:34:06,347
We'll do it just once more, then
after that we'll both be finished.

1223
01:34:06,569 --> 01:34:08,063
Come on.

1224
01:34:30,452 --> 01:34:32,071
Bye, my love.

1225
01:34:33,132 --> 01:34:34,785
That's the end of it.

1226
01:34:35,052 --> 01:34:37,547
We're free. It's over.

1227
01:34:50,733 --> 01:34:52,625
What are you guys celebrating?

1228
01:34:53,653 --> 01:34:57,353
John just finished a long run.
And I wrote a whole novel.

1229
01:34:57,453 --> 01:35:01,555
It was truly terrible, but I just had
to write it, so I threw it away.

1230
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:05,265
Piece of trash. There's only
one author in our family.

1231
01:35:05,775 --> 01:35:07,835
Here comes the rest of our lives.

1232
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:10,988
The rest of our lives is finally
coming up.

1233
01:35:11,175 --> 01:35:12,590
A toast.

1234
01:35:15,736 --> 01:35:18,550
- To the future.
- To the end of bears.

1235
01:35:19,576 --> 01:35:21,195
To love.

1236
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:22,865
Doom.

1237
01:35:24,016 --> 01:35:27,308
'How shall I speak of doom
and ours in special,

1238
01:35:27,536 --> 01:35:29,986
but as something altogether common.'

1239
01:35:32,177 --> 01:35:35,435
To passing the open windows.

1240
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:39,632
Passing the open windows.

1241
01:35:40,017 --> 01:35:42,677
Father got his hotel. Franny got
her movie.

1242
01:35:42,777 --> 01:35:44,715
Lilly's second book was published.

1243
01:35:44,817 --> 01:35:46,519
But life didn't become any easier.

1244
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:49,999
Lilly, the movie of your book's made
your sister more famous than you.

1245
01:35:50,099 --> 01:35:51,279
How do you feel about that?

1246
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:53,519
Acting and writing are two
different professions,

1247
01:35:53,619 --> 01:35:55,039
and there's no way to compare them.

1248
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:58,559
Franny, is it true that you're
involved with a black law student?

1249
01:35:58,659 --> 01:36:02,920
Excuse me. Don't you think
'Trying to Grow' has been a fluke?

1250
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:06,080
Because after all your new book
has flopped with the critics...

1251
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,880
That's a crock of shit,
you dumb asshole!

1252
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:10,396
All right, that's it, that's the end.

1253
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,993
That's enough. Thank you.

1254
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,272
No. Thank you very much.

1255
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:22,480
We all love you, Lilly.

1256
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,315
Thanks a lot, that's all.

1257
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:29,481
They are right, you know?
My new book was a let-down.

1258
01:36:29,581 --> 01:36:32,002
You listen to me. You're a great writer

1259
01:36:32,102 --> 01:36:34,163
and you're not gonna let
those people affect you.

1260
01:36:34,263 --> 01:36:37,123
You're right back to work
and I'm gonna take care of you.

1261
01:36:42,703 --> 01:36:45,358
But it's harder to be a writer
than a star.

1262
01:36:45,783 --> 01:36:47,755
Stars don't have to be alone.

1263
01:36:52,504 --> 01:36:57,241
Hi, Frank here, but actually
I'm not here.

1264
01:36:57,504 --> 01:36:59,681
Actually I'm out.

1265
01:37:00,944 --> 01:37:05,396
Wanna leave a message? Wait
for the signal and talk your heart out.

1266
01:37:09,665 --> 01:37:12,274
Hi, it's me.

1267
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,398
Goodbye, Frank.

1268
01:38:25,952 --> 01:38:28,447
But I'm always the fucking agent.

1269
01:38:29,232 --> 01:38:31,852
I brought this about. I think
I was too hard on her.

1270
01:38:31,952 --> 01:38:33,731
I gave her too much shit to do.

1271
01:38:34,712 --> 01:38:37,092
You're my agent too. I need you
now more than ever.

1272
01:38:37,192 --> 01:38:38,481
Frank?

1273
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:40,241
Frank, my boy.

1274
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:45,092
Lilly just dreamed more than she could.

1275
01:38:46,794 --> 01:38:49,130
She inherited than damn dreams from me.

1276
01:38:49,634 --> 01:38:53,054
It was Lilly that pushed herself.
It didn't matter who her agent was.

1277
01:38:53,154 --> 01:38:55,809
No, John, but it was me, it was me.

1278
01:38:58,995 --> 01:39:00,523
Come on, Susie.

1279
01:39:07,035 --> 01:39:09,007
She had little hands.

1280
01:39:10,675 --> 01:39:13,092
Her little hands, I remember.

1281
01:39:34,118 --> 01:39:35,897
It's so quiet.

1282
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:41,567
Did father know there were
no guests? We never knew.

1283
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,339
'The good hotel... ', father used to

1284
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:49,210
'... provide you with the space
and the atmosphere you need. '

1285
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:52,896
I was still the only one in our family
who didn't know what I needed.

1286
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:56,530
We need an animal around.

1287
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:59,131
Maybe we should invite Susie.

1288
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,249
Really.

1289
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,329
New York City is such a terrible
place to be a bear.

1290
01:40:31,123 --> 01:40:34,981
Franny and I decided
not to save it any longer.

1291
01:40:35,163 --> 01:40:37,852
Otherwise there would be
nothing else enough to save.

1292
01:40:52,724 --> 01:40:55,184
- Wouldn't you mother've loved all this?
- Yes, she would, Pop.

1293
01:40:55,284 --> 01:40:56,812
Good night, Pop.

1294
01:40:57,604 --> 01:41:01,135
Not every minute, but at least
this part.

1295
01:41:01,525 --> 01:41:03,054
At least the end.

1296
01:41:03,526 --> 01:41:05,746
- Sleep well.
- Good night, Pop.

1297
01:41:05,846 --> 01:41:07,784
- Sleep well.
- Good night.

1298
01:41:17,526 --> 01:41:21,103
I bet you Franny and Junior have
some beautiful kids one day.

1299
01:41:21,247 --> 01:41:23,587
Have you ever wanted
to have a baby, Susie?

1300
01:41:23,687 --> 01:41:25,181
A baby?

1301
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:30,020
I wouldn't bring an ugly child
into this world

1302
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:31,787
for anything.

1303
01:41:31,887 --> 01:41:33,586
You're not ugly, Susie.

1304
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,468
You're all so attractive, all of you.

1305
01:41:36,568 --> 01:41:39,388
You don't know the treatment
the ugly get in this world.

1306
01:41:39,488 --> 01:41:40,988
Susie, you're full of shit.

1307
01:41:41,088 --> 01:41:43,219
Why don't you just fucking grow up?

1308
01:41:43,768 --> 01:41:44,944
Poor Susie.

1309
01:41:45,608 --> 01:41:48,025
Will we ever get the bear out of you?

1310
01:42:07,611 --> 01:42:10,141
I just had to come, I'm sorry.

1311
01:42:11,371 --> 01:42:13,070
I'm sorry.

1312
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:19,104
I'm sweating like a pig
in this dumb suit.

1313
01:42:21,091 --> 01:42:22,541
Honey.

1314
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:42,753
I look so awful, I don't dare
take it off.

1315
01:42:47,214 --> 01:42:51,792
It's going to be lighter soon, and then
you'll see how ugly I am.

1316
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,943
I see you now and I think
you're beautiful.

1317
01:43:06,735 --> 01:43:09,948
You're going to have to work hard
to convince me.

1318
01:43:40,018 --> 01:43:41,911
What a beautiful morning.

1319
01:43:44,779 --> 01:43:49,197
I have some news for you, Pop.
Susie's gonna stay with us.

1320
01:43:51,139 --> 01:43:52,918
Isn't that perfect?

1321
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:57,630
You couldn't have asked for
a better hotel, but we needed a bear.

1322
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:02,516
Everybody does. That's what
we've been missing.

1323
01:44:06,421 --> 01:44:10,475
You're home free, John.
We're all home free.

1324
01:44:10,981 --> 01:44:13,079
You've written a happy ending.

1325
01:44:15,142 --> 01:44:16,670
The dawn.

1326
01:44:18,902 --> 01:44:21,670
The dawn is such a wonder to the blind.

1327
01:44:27,142 --> 01:44:29,115
You know what Lilly would have said?

1328
01:44:29,943 --> 01:44:32,199
Life is a fairy tale.

1329
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:40,005
So we dream on inventing our lives.

1330
01:45:40,429 --> 01:45:42,321
Our little lost sister.

1331
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:46,046
Our sainted mother. Our hero father.

1332
01:45:46,589 --> 01:45:50,326
But our dreams escape us
however we have imagined them.

1333
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:53,841
There's only one thing you can do.

1334
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,927
Keep passing the open windows.
