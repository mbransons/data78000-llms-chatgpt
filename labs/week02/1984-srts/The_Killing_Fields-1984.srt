1
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:02,287
What did you do that for?

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:04,786
The guy's insecure enough already.

3
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:09,392
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:15,408
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

5
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:17,872
...and the Cambodians out.

6
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,056
If you have papers,
you have a name.

7
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,357
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
Look, I fight for five years.

9
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,544
Useless war.

10
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,050
Fuck!

11
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,301
You know, Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

12
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:16,106
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

13
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:18,087
Does Syd know how serious this is?

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,802
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

15
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:26,440
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

16
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,747
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

17
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:32,971
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

18
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:36,914
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

19
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,283
It's worth a try.

20
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:42,220
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

21
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,383
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

22
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:00,270
Give me two or three weeks.

23
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:03,655
If you get there first, let me know.

24
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,828
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

25
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:11,211
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

26
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,991
I got no time to give you.

27
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,229
Swain's got an idea.

28
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:25,294
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

29
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,910
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

30
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:31,016
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

31
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,166
I don't think so.

32
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,603
Give him your passport.

33
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,874
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

34
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,090
Khmer Rouge took everything.

35
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,233
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

36
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,263
Fuck!

37
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:44,331
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

38
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,393
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

39
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:52,013
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

40
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,638
We'll find the film.

41
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,966
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

42
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,656
No, I haven't got any film!

43
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,301
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,072
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

45
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,374
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

46
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,628
Shit!

47
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,755
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,144
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

49
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,728
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

50
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:31,979
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,041
What?

52
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:38,002
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

53
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,942
Come on down here.

54
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,379
Go to the end of the hall there.

55
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,568
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

56
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,968
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

57
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:53,295
Syd, I have got the camera...

58
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,499
...I have got the film...

59
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:58,828
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

60
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,488
All right. Don't smile.

61
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:10,922
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

62
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,657
Stop, please.

63
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,722
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

64
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,148
Okay, cover it.

65
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,797
This fucking paper, I don't know.

66
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,994
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

67
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,708
Ankertill Brewer.

68
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,883
Ankertill Brewer.

69
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,095
Getting an image.
Look at it.

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,785
Look, the bugger's face.

71
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,160
It sure is. Come on.

72
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,269
Come on.

73
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,284
Come on.

74
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:17,258
Now fix it.

75
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,274
That's good.

76
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,645
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

77
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,216
Goddamn it.

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,158
Goddamn this paper!

79
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:33,489
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

80
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,078
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

81
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,150
I did it.

82
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,674
Let me have that.

83
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,253
It's fading.

84
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,084
Take it out.

85
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:59,924
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

86
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:01,808
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

87
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:03,020
Fuck!

88
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,491
Goddamn it!

89
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,594
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

90
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,130
Could I just...?

91
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,304
I'll just do it myself, okay?

92
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,699
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

93
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:21,581
Fuck.

94
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:23,797
Sorry.

95
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,024
That's it.

96
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:56,406
It's perfect.

97
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:58,768
Perfect.

98
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,153
Welcome to New York. We got it.

99
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,425
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

100
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:20,208
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

101
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,921
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

102
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,487
This is the last call for passports.

103
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:28,817
Can I have your passports, please?

104
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:31,448
Can I have your passports, please?

105
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,740
Thank you.

106
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,016
Passports, ladies and gents.

107
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:41,167
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

108
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,494
Your passports, please.

109
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,762
On this passport depend my life.

110
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,167
Thank you.

111
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:54,515
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

112
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:00,332
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

113
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:02,993
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

114
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,720
Come on, passports, please.

115
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,049
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

116
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,394
Going...

117
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:10,678
...going...

118
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,112
...gone.

119
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,764
Is this lunch?

120
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:53,975
What?

121
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,026
It seems certain
that the majority...

122
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:03,766
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

123
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:07,194
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

124
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,497
Hello again.

125
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:17,522
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

126
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:20,281
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

127
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,244
Now, listen, everybody.

128
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,330
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

129
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,368
Probably in the next 24 hours.

130
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:36,433
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

131
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,833
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

132
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,932
These so-called journalists
have no right...

133
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,127
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

134
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,837
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

135
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,304
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

136
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,420
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

137
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,576
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

138
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,677
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

139
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:09,434
Don't forget. All right?

140
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,416
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

141
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,301
You had no right to keep him here!

142
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,540
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

143
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:19,585
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

144
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,784
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

145
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,855
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

146
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,614
Goodbye, Rockoff.

147
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,579
Tell my wife I love her...

148
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,015
...and look after all my children.

149
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,564
She doesn't speak any English.

150
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,731
Please...

151
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:09,817
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

152
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,827
Dith Pran.

153
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,792
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

154
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,055
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

155
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,829
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

156
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:00,641
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

157
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:01,634
In April 1975.

158
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,337
4144-5364...

159
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:39,137
Pran is a resourceful man.

160
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,856
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

161
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:43,812
...and then he'll make his move.

162
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,143
Thank you for coming...

163
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:04,448
...and taking care of her
and her family.

164
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,964
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

165
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:09,892
That's not true.

166
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,828
That's absolutely not true.

167
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,232
It's not true. It's not.

168
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,246
She doesn't believe you...

169
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,374
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

170
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,705
You're a good man.

171
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:58,815
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

172
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,909
You better go.

173
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,626
For the past 5 years...

174
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:46,146
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

175
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:50,828
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

176
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:54,915
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

177
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,745
As the President spoke...

178
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:00,323
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

179
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:06,220
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

180
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:08,299
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

181
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:11,751
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

182
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:16,998
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

183
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:26,156
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

184
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:29,928
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

185
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,589
We will aid Cambodia.

186
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,010
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

187
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:27,855
Sydney...

188
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,343
...I think of you often
and often my family.

189
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,176
They tell us that God is dead.

190
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:39,503
And now the party they call
the Angka...

191
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,320
...will provide everything for us.

192
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,751
He says Angka has identified...

193
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,852
...and proclaims the existence...

194
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:50,193
...of a bad new disease...

195
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,094
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

196
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,134
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

197
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,861
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

198
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,750
The enemy is inside us.

199
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:08,337
No one can be trusted.

200
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:19,629
We must be like the ox...

201
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,376
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

202
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:26,869
No love but for the Angka.

203
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:32,845
People starve...

204
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:36,142
...but we must not grow food.

205
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:40,857
We must honor the comrade children...

206
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,180
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

207
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,013
Is anybody of us...

208
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,035
...a doctor...

209
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:15,697
...professor...

210
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,304
...and student?

211
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,476
Angka needs you.

212
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:22,168
Angka has forgiven all the past.

213
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:37,521
Sydney...

214
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:42,798
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

215
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,555
...in the years
of the great struggle...

216
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:49,682
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

217
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:53,648
...because now is the year zero...

218
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,467
...and everything is to start anew.

219
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,832
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

220
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,941
I must show no understanding.

221
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,498
Not of French or English.

222
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:15,094
I must have no past, Sydney.

223
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:18,389
This is the year zero...

224
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,077
...and nothing has gone before.

225
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:36,439
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

226
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:39,698
The war has killed love, Sydney.

227
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:43,669
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

228
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,225
And no one dare ask where they go.

229
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,705
Here, only the silent survive.

230
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:24,414
Mercedes, number one!

231
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:48,364
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

232
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:54,693
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

233
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:00,229
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

234
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,602
But I can't stand here tonight...

235
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,356
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

236
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:09,991
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

237
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,949
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

238
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:20,300
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

239
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,276
...concerned themselves
with many things:

240
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:28,486
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

241
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,493
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

242
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:36,909
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

243
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,011
They had domestic concerns as well...

244
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:44,813
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

245
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:49,161
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

246
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,888
...in their own careers.

247
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:54,219
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

248
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,840
...were the Cambodians themselves.

249
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:58,986
Not the people...

250
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,350
...not the society...

251
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:03,370
...not the country.

252
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:07,824
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

253
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:13,290
Dith Pran and I...

254
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:15,910
...tried to record and bring home...

255
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:19,728
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

256
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,966
To human beings...

257
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,867
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

258
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,822
...but who paid the price...

259
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,123
...and took the beating for them.

260
00:40:35,378 --> 00:40:39,373
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

261
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:41,452
I'm very honored...

262
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,653
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

263
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,429
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

264
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:05,647
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

265
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,184
I'm sorry.

266
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,913
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

267
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:16,232
Abe, meet my sister.

268
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,189
I'm very happy to meet you.

269
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,753
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

270
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,739
One second.

271
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,997
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

272
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:29,045
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

273
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,988
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

274
00:41:40,754 --> 00:41:44,400
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

275
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,487
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

276
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:52,817
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

277
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:56,848
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

278
00:41:57,046 --> 00:41:57,842
What?

279
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,815
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

280
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:04,011
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

281
00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:06,830
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

282
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,699
The fuck you didn't.

283
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:14,636
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

284
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:17,075
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

285
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,764
I'm doing everything I can.

286
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:22,132
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

287
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:25,459
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

288
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:29,167
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

289
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,949
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

290
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,661
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

291
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:42,867
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

292
00:42:43,382 --> 00:42:44,844
Life isn't a '40s movie.

293
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:48,725
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

294
00:42:50,264 --> 00:42:52,946
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

295
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:58,799
Congrats.

296
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,245
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

297
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,553
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

298
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,499
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

299
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:10,963
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

300
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:14,740
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

301
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:17,141
We made a mistake.

302
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:20,175
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

303
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,798
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

304
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:24,112
That is provocative...

305
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:27,572
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

306
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:30,103
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

307
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:31,791
Don't you believe them?

308
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:35,701
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

309
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:38,098
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

310
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:40,685
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

311
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:43,155
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

312
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,685
Will you be covering the boat people?

313
00:43:45,877 --> 00:43:46,957
No, I will not.

314
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,784
Do you want a cup of tea?

315
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,168
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

316
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,162
I must have sent 500 letters.

317
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:07,028
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

318
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:09,810
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

319
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,469
I don't know who I didn't write to.

320
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,233
I never really gave him any choice.

321
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:29,459
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

322
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,359
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

323
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:47,702
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

324
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:53,968
But I never discussed it with him.

325
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:07,515
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

326
00:45:13,306 --> 00:45:15,095
And I stayed because...

327
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,326
I'm trapped, Sydney.

328
00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:51,546
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

329
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,421
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

330
00:48:55,712 --> 00:48:57,721
I must take much care.

331
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:02,138
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

332
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:07,361
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

333
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,839
And now they say we must fight them.

334
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:17,596
I miss you, my wife, my children.

335
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:21,108
And my heart hungers for news of you.

336
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:45,721
New China Radio reports...

337
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:49,088
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

338
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:51,552
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

339
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:54,430
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

340
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,961
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

341
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:01,855
Taxi driver, huh?

342
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:20,735
I think you speak English.

343
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:22,429
Sit down.

344
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:30,809
You know, I love this country.

345
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:35,231
I sacrificed everything for it.

346
00:50:36,645 --> 00:50:39,995
My wife died for the revolution.

347
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:46,335
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

348
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:50,653
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

349
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,394
And they don't trust me.

350
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:57,634
I fear...

351
00:50:58,981 --> 00:51:01,217
...really fear for the future.

352
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:08,795
I think you love my son.

353
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:12,988
For his sake...

354
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,360
...look after him.

355
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:22,300
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

356
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,867
If the Vietnamese get here...

357
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:27,135
...Angka will destroy everything...

358
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:30,685
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

359
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:35,560
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

360
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:33,849
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

361
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:40,464
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

362
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:42,293
Abe, I've got some great news!

363
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,906
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

364
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:00,891
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

365
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:03,092
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

366
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:06,043
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

367
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,755
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

368
01:04:09,114 --> 01:04:10,741
Is your mother there?

369
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:14,356
When?

370
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:19,223
All right,
I want you to get this down.

371
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:22,582
No, write it down. Write it down.

372
01:04:24,062 --> 01:04:26,100
I've got a message from your dad!

373
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,208
How you been?

374
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:50,740
Do you forgive me?

375
01:05:51,422 --> 01:05:53,911
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
