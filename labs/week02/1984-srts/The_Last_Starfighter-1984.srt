1
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,399
- Good morning.

2
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:59,068
It“s 8:00 in wonderful Coombs County,
where once again...

3
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,702
state police have refused to confirm or deny...

4
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,409
more of those mysterious ““lights in
the sky““ sightings by local residents.

5
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,409
Roving air reporters spoke with Miss
Josie Floss, who made such a sighting.

6
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:12,719
I seen that sightin“ with my own eyes.

7
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,418
And when I called the police,
they told me it was swamp gas.

8
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:20,429
- Bullshit! Ain“t no swamps in Coombs County!

9
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:25,425
- Gonna be a sparklin“ day.

10
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,562
Sparklin“.

11
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,837
Makes me crazy! Clara!

12
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,639
Clara!

13
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:37,579
My electric“s gone out again, Clara!
I'm gonna miss my soaps!

14
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:39,617
- Oh, stop your yakkin“.
- Bill?

15
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:43,451
Bill, Elvira“s blacked out again! Pass the word.

16
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,252
- Have a nice day, honey.
- Thanks, Mrs. Boone. You too.

17
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:48,655
Elvira“s got no electric.

18
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,786
She can“t see her soaps, she“ll hyperventilate.

19
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,956
Great day for a picnic, Maggie!

20
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,865
- Can“t wait, Mr. Boone. Catch yourself a big one!
- If I can!

21
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:59,768
Granny, I fixed you lunch
and put it in the fridge.

22
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:01,736
- Have fun, child.
- Sure you“re gonna be okay?

23
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:06,743
I'll be fine, dear. Now you just run along. Bye!

24
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,709
- Hi, Mrs. Rogan.
- Hi, Maggie.

25
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,012
- Did you find that picnic basket yet?
- Mmm-huh.

26
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,284
- It“s in the living room.
- Oh, thanks. Where“s Alex?

27
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,224
- Where else?
- Right.

28
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,658
- Louis.

29
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,329
- Good morning, space-son Louis.
- Earthling.

30
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:32,631
- Louis!
- Yoohoo, Jane!

31
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:37,640
Elvira“s electric is out again, and she“s
gonna get hyper if she can“t see her soaps!

32
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,642
- Bleep.

33
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:44,772
Granny, tell Elvira that Alex“ll be over to
patch her electric in time for the soaps.

34
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,851
I'll tell her, Jane.
Elvira!

35
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,548
- Louis! Louis!
- Bleep-bleep.

36
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:54,354
- Go tell Alex I need him.
- Beware, aliens. Louis Rogan...

37
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:58,556
the cosmic cadet,
the space avenger, is on your case.

38
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,599
Greetings, Starfighter!

00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,746
Okay. Let“s go.

44
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:27,715

88
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:38,039
- I don“t know.

89
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:42,917
- Hey, that“s a good idea.
- But we played cards last night.

90
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:48,017
Well... The missus wants to go into
town tonight and go dancing.

91
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:22,984
The fish were really bitin“
down there at the stream.

92
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:26,427
It was pleasant fishin“ today.

93
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:31,230
Yup. It“s gonna be pleasant tomorrow too.

94
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:35,500
Gonna be a pleasant summer
accordin“ to Farmer“s Almanac.

95
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:40,839
Yeah. I love the Farmer“s
Almanac. I've been readin“ it for years.

96
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,903
Greetings, Starfighter.

97
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:45,505
You have been recruited by the Star League...

98
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:49,108
to defend the frontier against
Xur and the Kodan Armada.

99
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,212
- Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,950

101
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,628

102
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,639

103
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,944
Where“s your Maggie?

104
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:23,543
Good question.

105
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,679
Out having a good time, I guess.

106
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:30,386
Oh. And you never have a good time. Is that it?

107
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,555
Oh, sure. I love patching 30-year-old fuse panels...

108
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,565
and plunging people“s toilets.

109
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,363
Otis, l-I never even get a chance
to have a good time around here.

110
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:45,208
Things change.
Always do.

111
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,170
You“ll get your chance!

112
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,614
Important thing is, when it comes...

113
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:56,915
You gotta grab it with both hands and hold on tight

114
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,927
Enemy squadrons in Sector 367 closing fast.

115
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:14,964
- Thanks, Jack.
- You“re welcome.

116
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,132
- Good night, Maggie.
- Good night.

117
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,575
Thought you were gonna meet me at the lake.

118
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,577
What happened?

119
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,204
Same thing that always happens:
I couldn“t get away.

120
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:02,148
Where“s everybody else?

121
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:04,244
Oh, they went to a movie.

122
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:09,092
Old Jack Blake just happened
to be going your way, huh?

123
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:12,527
Enemy squadron in Sector 3.

124
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,465
- He said it was on his way.
- Blake lives on the other side of town.

125
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:22,471
Come on, Alex. I wanted to get back to you.

126
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,037
Okay?

127
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,744
Good show, Starfighter! Way to go.

128
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:39,653
- Alex, look!
- Oh, my God. What is that?

129
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,851
900,000!

130
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:51,664
900,000!
You gonna bust the record!

131
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:58,003
Hey! Hey!
Listen up, everybody!

132
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,373
Alex is going for the record!

133
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,705
- Record?

Got “em!
Oh, come and get that one!

135
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:13,923
You can do it!

136
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:20,497
Otis, what are you
yelling about? What“s wrong?

137
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:24,467
Come on! C-Come on!
He“s going to bust the record!

138
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:27,436
- Hurry! Hurry!

139
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,029
Everyone get back!
Don“t crowd him!

140
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,338
I said, get back!

141
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:44,278
- Alex, you never got this far before!
- Go, Alex!

142
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,452
Good boy!

143
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:55,999
Kodan command ship entering kill zone.

144
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,467
- Command ship!
- Oh, command ship!

145
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,005
- What“s a command ship?
- You can do it, Alex! You can do it!

146
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:10,644
One more now. Come on! That“s the one!
That“s the one we want!

147
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,624
- Yeah! Yeah!

148
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:58,689
- Good night. Way to go, Alex!
- “Night, kids.

149
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:02,061
Alex, you“re something else.
You“re wonderful, boy.

150
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,694
- Thank you.
- If I said it once, I said it a thousand times.

151
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:09,534
- That boy“s gonna go places.
- That“s one smart boy.

152
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,421
“Night, Alex.

153
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,724
“““Night, Alex““?
Wait a second.

154
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,762
Maggie? Maggie?

155
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:37,129
Hold on a second.
Where are you going?

156
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:44,135
What“s wrong?

157
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,972
Well, I guess it just hit me.

158
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,479
You really are leaving here, aren“t you?

159
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,573
Of course, I'm leaving.
We“re both gonna leave here.

160
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,049
- Both of us, Alex?
- Yeah.

161
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,245
We-We-We talked about this.

162
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:00,018
When I get to school, I'm gonna find
a place, and I'm gonna come and get you.

163
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:03,788
- Well, what about Granny?
- Granny?

164
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,590
Truth is you“re scared of leaving this trailer park.

165
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,293
I'm not scared of leaving
this trailer park, Alex.

166
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,803
Hey. Listen.

167
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,899
Whatever happens, it“s you and me forever, right?

168
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,406
Right?

169
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:29,343
- I love you so much, Alex.
- I'll always love you, Maggs.

170
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,119
Diarrhea.

171
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,943
Maggie! Maggie!

172
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:58,642
Alex, I got to go in.
“Night.

173
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:00,673
- “Night.
- “Night.

174
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:22,401
Someday they“re gonna say,
““This is where it all began. ““

175
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,603
- What?
- Mom, I finally broke the Starfighter record.

176
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:32,944
- Oh, that“s nice, dear.
- Nice? It“s stupendous!

177
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,577
Uh, Alex...

178
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,611
Mr. Brenner knew that you“d want
to see this as soon as possible...

179
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,920
so he brought it by the diner and, uh...

180
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,927
Well, I was so excited, l-I opened it.

181
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:47,419
- Oh, that“s okay. What is it?
- It“s about your loan.

182
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:58,438
You can... still go to City College
with your friends.

183
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,348
Greetings, Starfighter.

184
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:47,813
Greetings, Starfighter. You have been recruited
by the Star League to defend the frontier.

185
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,520
- You have been recruited...
Greetings, Starfighter.

186
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,825
You have been recruited...

187
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:55,354
You have been recruited...

188
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,457
You have been recruited...

189
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:04,269
Get ready.
Prepare for blastoff.

190
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:49,415
Hello. Excuse me, son.

191
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,557
- Store“s closed, mister.
I'm not here for cigarettes or bubble gum, my boy

192
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,254
Can you tell me the name of the person who broke
the record on that game over there?

193
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,330
Where I might find him?

194
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:05,166
Alex Rogan.
You“re lookin“ at him.

195
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:08,864
Alex Rogan. Aha-ha.

196
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,873
- Who are you?
- Centauri“s the name.

197
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:14,808
- I invented Starfighter, which is why I'm here.
- It is?

198
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:18,144
It is. We have to talk about a matter of
utmost importance. Step into my office.

199
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,543
That“s it.
Come on now.

200
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:25,645
Nothing to be afraid of.

201
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:32,756
Oh, yes. Say hello to my assistant, Beta.

202
00:20:32,863 --> 00:20:35,764
- Howdy.

203
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:40,803
- Ow!
- I must congratulate you on
your virtuoso performance.

204
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:43,669
Centauri is impressed.
I've seen “em come and I've seen “em go.

205
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,799
But you“re the best, my boy.
Dazzling.

206
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,470
Light years ahead of the competition.

207
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,479
Which is why Centauri is here.

208
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:54,574
He“s got a little proposition for you.
Are ya interested?

209
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,488
- I guess.

210
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:02,855
- Hey!

211
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,233
- What are you doing?
- Listen. Centauri wants to keep it for a surprise.

212
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:15,135
Trust me. Oh, ho-ho-ho,
you“re gonna love it. Love it!

213
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:24,742
The amusing thing about this: It“s all a big mistake.

214
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:27,783
That particular Starfighter game was
supposed to be delivered to Vegas...

215
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:32,345
not some flea-speck trailer park in the
middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas.

216
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,447
So it must be fate, destiny...

217
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,891
blind chance, luck even, that brings us together.

218
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,453
And as the poet says, ““The rest is history. ““

219
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:54,075
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

220
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:56,204
I told you.
I wanna save it for a surprise.

221
00:21:56,313 --> 00:22:01,842
Hey. Are you the kind of kid who reads
the last page of a mystery first?

222
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,183
Who pesters the magician to tell you his tricks?

223
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:07,019
Who sneaks downstairs to peek
at his Christmas presents?

224
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,218
No. Of course you“re not!

225
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:13,023
That“s why
~ I'm not gonna tell you ~

226
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,963
Oh, God.

227
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:19,730
Besides, I just love surprises, don“t you?

228
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:22,032
Hey, look out!

229
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,733
- Stop! - Oh, dear!
- Hit the brakes!

230
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:26,639
Hey...

231
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,443
Ohhh, sh...

232
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:28,327
Shifting into star drive
at Columbus Theta. Hold tight.

233
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,910
Prea tahd. Prea tahd na.

234
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,511
- Prea tahd na.
- Prea tahd na.

235
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:23,923
- Prea tahd na sat suela. Prea tahd na.

236
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:32,952
Hey. Hey, let me out of here!

237
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,443
Rinkyin see.

238
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,788
Kitae. Kitae.

239
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:06,422
- Kitae.

240
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:17,639
- There“s a perfectly logical explanation for all this.
- Kitae.

241
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,812
Kitae un na.
Na.

242
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:36,122
- Hey! Wa... Wait! Where you going?

243
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:55,038
Hi! How are you?
Uh, what is this?

244
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:57,443
Listen.
Do you speak English? I'd...

245
00:26:57,547 --> 00:26:59,538
Uh, this is nice but, uh...

246
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,986
- Hisanja pt.
- Hisanja?

247
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,790
- Honee mat suela!
Prea tahd, prea tahd. Pt pt.

248
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,990
Centauri, what“s goin“ on here?

249
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:17,293
- He“s just saying how delighted he is
that you“re here. - Na prea.

250
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,792
And if there“s anything he can do to make
your stay more enjoyable, just give him a ring.

251
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:23,601
My stay? What are you talkin“ about?
Where are we?

252
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,800
Welcome to Rylos, my boy!

253
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,503
- Rylos?

254
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:31,103
Wait a minute. You mean...
You mean like in the game?

255
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,946
Oh, he“s quick. He“s quick.
He“s very quick. He“s speechless.

256
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,950
So long, Alex!
Have fun!

257
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:39,920
May the luck of the Seven Pillars
of Gulu be with you at all times.

258
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:43,424
Oh, someday these cheapskates
will thank Centauri. Trust me.

259
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,427
Bula!

260
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,825
Where the hell is June?

261
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:57,772
Yolanda, baby!

262
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,512
Hi, Maggs.

263
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:13,784
Hi, Louis.
Is he up?

264
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,486
Yeah. He“s been up all night... moaning.

265
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:26,224
- Alex?

266
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:32,097
Your mother told me about the loan.
Is there anything I can do?

267
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:43,452
Listen. I'll be next door
if you need anything, okay?

268
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,463
Gunstars.

269
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,963
I gotta be dreamin“.

270
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:10,234
Eeyai... kita.

271
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,638
Yeah, right. Kita.

272
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:20,978
Listen, there“s been a big mistake.

273
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:24,713
- Immediately after
situation report. Navigation...

274
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:27,052
Welcome to Starfighter Command.

275
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:31,093
- You speak English?
- No. You hear English thanks
to your translator device.

276
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:35,097
Hurry up. We haven“t got much
time. The briefing begins immediately.

277
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:39,067
- Join the other recruits.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

278
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:41,070
Wait a minute!
What are you talking about, recruits?

279
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,567
- I don“t believe this.

280
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:53,312
Attention.
Attention please.
Ambassador Enduran has arrived...

281
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:57,479
and will now address
Starfighter Command personnel.

282
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:04,626
- As you all know, we have been on a desperate
quest... - Excuse me. Excuse me.

283
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,720
- To find Starfighters and navigators

284
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:14,735
I should... I should
crush you to gorun dust!

285
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:16,932
I'm sorry, uh-uh...
It was an accident.

286
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:21,239
L-l-I didn“t mean to step on your,
uh... whatever that is.

287
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,575
- Hideous creature.
- If I may continue.

288
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:29,949
- Our forces have...
- You don“t trifle with a Bogati. They love to fight.

289
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:32,352
That“s why they“re perfect for this war.

290
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,285
- Did you say ““war““?
- But of course!

291
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,327
Why else do you think you“re here?

292
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:40,761
You were recruited by the Star League to defend...

293
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:44,595
““... to defend the frontier against Xur
and the Kodan Armada. ““

294
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,601
Oy, vey.

295
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:52,369
Eons ago, our ancestors
created our great frontier...

296
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:57,879
a barrier of energy encircling
the peaceful systems of the universe.

297
00:31:57,914 --> 00:32:02,908
And forever shutting out
the scourge that lurks beyond.

298
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:09,514
Fellow Rylans, because of a dark betrayal...

299
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,618
- our frontier will soon collapse.

300
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,324
So we turn to you, Starfighters
and your navigators.

301
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:23,065
For of all the billions
of creatures in the Star League...

302
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:28,839
only you few were found to possess the, uh...

303
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:30,970
gift.

304
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:34,278
You, and you alone...

305
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:38,844
stand between us and
the black terror of the Kodan.

306
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:44,393
- Victory or death!
- Victory or death!

307
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:47,361
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

308
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:50,298
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

309
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,460
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

310
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,868
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

311
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,703
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

312
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:01,902
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

313
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:05,108
Victory or death!
Victory or death!

314
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:08,446
Now, Starfighters, if you will
reach underneath your seats...

315
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,954
- you will find a packet which
contains one hand trans...

316
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:20,189
This is a restricted area off-limits to...

317
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,360
My apologies, Starfighter.

318
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:28,028
Star Navigator First Class Grig
at your service, sir!

319
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:35,334
Hi. I'm Alex Rogan. I was playing this game
back home, and this guy came up to me.

320
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:37,346
Only he“s not a guy.
He“s an alien, right?

321
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:40,177
And I get into his car.
Only it“s not a car. It“s a spaceship.

322
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:43,582
And, uh...
There“s been a big mistake.

323
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:47,851
Am I to understand you“re actually declining
the honor of becoming a Starfighter?

324
00:33:47,957 --> 00:33:51,791
- You got it.
- Extraordinary!

325
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:55,957
For eons, all creatures have
dreamt of being Starfighters.

326
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:58,090
- Where you from?
- Earth.

327
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:01,466
And we“re not at war with anybody
except each other.

328
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:05,029
Earth? Earth isn“t a formal member
of the Star League...

329
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:07,609
and isn“t due to be approached
until it matures.

330
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:10,511
This is all highly irregular.

331
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:12,811
Tell me.
Who recruited you?

332
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,850
Centauri.

333
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:19,752
- There he is. That“s him!
- Centauri. I might have known.

334
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,916
~ Di-aye-diliddle-di-di
Dum, dum, diliddli... ~

335
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:26,759
Up to your old Excalibur tricks
again, eh, Centauri?

336
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,389
Did it ever occur to you
that it is against the law...

337
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:32,127
to recruit from worlds
outside the Star League?

338
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:36,729
Earth “s in danger too, isn“t it? And,
no, I didn“t use the Excalibur test.

339
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:39,936
It was called a video game.
What“s all the brouhaha?

340
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,739
After all, he does have the gift!

341
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:47,910
This may come as bit of a shock to you,
but he doesn“t want to be a Starfighter.

342
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,543
Doesn“t want to be a...
Are you a coward?

343
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:54,145
- Are you crazy?
- You didn“t tell me about any of this!

344
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,885
Return the money, Centauri!

345
00:34:56,993 --> 00:35:00,360
Return the money?
Are you delirious?

346
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:03,591
You know how long it took to invent
the games, to merchandise them...

347
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:06,796
to get “em into the stores by Christmas?

348
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:10,839
It must be terribly embarrassing
for you, and I do sympathize. However...

349
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:14,343
But I saw him fight! He could be
the greatest Starfighter ever!

350
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,210
- That was a game, Centauri.
- A game?

351
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:21,512
You may have thought it was a game,
but it was also a test.

352
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:25,487
Aha! A test! Sent out across
the universe to find those...

353
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,819
with the gift to be Starfighters.

354
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,950
And here you are, my boy.
Here you are!

355
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:35,327
- Right! Here I am, about to be killed!
- Killed.

356
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:38,232
You don“t seriously think it“s
dangerous, do you?

357
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:43,465
- Don“t be silly! Trust me!

358
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,655
Xur!

359
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,624
Xur!

360
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,491
Xur?

361
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:09,588
Yes, Father, your mighty frontier...

362
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,600
grows weaker by the moment.

363
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:16,331
Do not call me father!

364
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,839
You are no longer my son!

365
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:22,605
You“re an outcast!
Why have you returned?

366
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:25,203
I have returned for the good of all Rylans.

367
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:28,715
With an armada of Kodan
warships behind you?

368
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:32,312
There are some Rylans
who would welcome me, Father.

369
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:36,415
Star League justice put
down your Xurian cult.

370
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:41,259
- Your followers are few and scattered.
- Star League?

371
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,333
A refuge for weak worlds
not worthy to be our equals!

372
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:47,369
That is for the Rylans to decide...

373
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:51,533
and not for a dangerous and evil child
such as yourself.

374
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:54,873
And yet it is this child...

375
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:58,640
who caught your master spy.

376
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:30,638
Hear me, Rylans!

377
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:33,944
When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed...

378
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:37,110
Kodan armada will invade.

379
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:42,147
And not even your mighty Starfighters
will be able to save you.

380
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:44,658
We shall see, Xur.

381
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,820
We shall see!

382
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,737
You still want to go?

383
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,708
And miss all the excitement?

384
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:10,816
Little brat. I invent
the game, find the kid...

385
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,685
drag him up there, and he
doesn“t want to be a Starfighter.

386
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,317
I give up!

387
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,519
Control, do you copy
our star angle difference...

388
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,622
from parking angle?

389
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:02,500
Delta beta two at six,
delta gamma three at five.

390
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,607
Emperor Xur ordered me
to bring his scepter.

391
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:14,474
Let him enter.

392
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:17,018
Target vector remains on scope.

393
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,692
Just like your Kodan emperor“s,
isn“t it, Commander Kril?

394
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:39,207
It takes more than
a scepter to rule, Xur...

395
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:41,503
even on Rylos.

396
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:47,011
You“re right, Kril.

397
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:51,815
It does take more than a scepter.

398
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:02,229
How long must we endure this fool?

399
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:07,430
- We have a break in the frontier.
- Fire the meteor gun!

400
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:12,229
My dear Kodan friends!
Lest we forget...

401
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:16,937
it was your own emperor who
granted me command of this armada.

402
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:20,538
For only I hold the secret to the frontier.

403
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,346
Only I know the location
of the Starfighter base.

404
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:27,652
And therefore, only I will
give the order to fire!

405
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,153
Forgive me, Xur.

406
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:42,665
You are forgiven, Commander Kril.

407
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:49,103
Meteor gunner... fire.

408
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:23,568
Sergeant!

409
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,974
I have an unidentified
incoming object in Sector 31, sir.

410
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:37,692
They“re headed for the base!
Alert! We are under attack!

411
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,887
I repeat:
We are under attack!

412
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:43,857
Activate automatic repulser guns.

413
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:41,054
Condition Red! Condition Red!

414
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:53,397
At last it is done!

415
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:57,872
Soon the frontier will be down
and they will bow to their new emperor!

416
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:00,899
Or I will darken the sky
with their ashes.

417
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:04,002
Commander, the Xurian spy reports that
one Starfighter has escaped.

418
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:08,447
Escaped?

419
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,362
You sure I can“t give you a hand?

420
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:26,128
- You“ve done quite enough already. Thank you.
- Well, uh...

421
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:30,171
It“s only a few more miles from here.
I guess... I guess I can walk it.

422
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,367
So long!
Bye, Centauri!

423
00:43:45,654 --> 00:43:48,589
Oh, Alex!

424
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:51,057
Here!

425
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:57,055
Hey, listen. I can“t take
a present from you, Centauri.

426
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:01,660
Oh, ho-ho-ho... He reduces me to poverty
again and he thinks I'm giving him a present.

427
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:03,899
- What a world this is.
- What is it, then?

428
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:05,997
It“s a second chance, my boy!

429
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:09,407
If you change your mind,
just tap the communo-crystals.

430
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,309
- Keep it.
- Ahh, Alex, Alex!

431
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:19,546
You“re walking away
from history. History!

432
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,056
Did Chris Columbus say
he wanted to stay home? No!

433
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,753
What if the Wright Brothers
thought that only birds should fly?

434
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:30,924
- And did Geloca think the Yulus were too
ugly to save? - Who“s Geloca?

435
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:35,529
Never mind.

436
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:37,539
Listen, Centauri.
I'm not any of those guys.

437
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,541
- I'm a kid from a trailer park.
- If that“s what you think...

438
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:44,238
then that“s all you“ll ever be!

439
00:45:13,342 --> 00:45:16,038
Hey, Maggie!

440
00:45:16,145 --> 00:45:18,511
Listen to me. You“re not
going to believe this.

441
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:21,310
I told you, Alex. Me and my...
how did you put it...

442
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:25,649
strange sexual urges
aren“t talking to you anymore.

443
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:09,989
- Who“s there!
- Shh! You“re gonna wake up Louis.

444
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:23,008
- Hey, you look like me!
- “Course I do. I'm the beta unit.

445
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:28,914
- What the helI's a beta unit?
- A beta unit is a simuloid...

446
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:32,146
an exact duplicate of you,
only not as loud.

447
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:36,817
- Huh?
- I was in the starcar, remember?
We shook hands?

448
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:40,351
I became you... unfortunately.

449
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:46,128
- Let me get this straight. You“re a robot?
- I beg your pardon.

450
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:49,534
I'm a state-of-the-art,
top-of-the-line beta unit...

451
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:52,937
put here as a courtesy replacement
for while you“re away.

452
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:55,466
Lucky me.

453
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:59,536
- What are you doing back?
- Are you kidding? It“s war up there!

454
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:03,381
Oh. Save the whales and not the universe, huh?

455
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:05,478
Well, why don“t you go up there and fight?

456
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:08,217
Simuloids can“t fight.
We“re not allowed.

457
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:11,782
- Well, tell “em that you“re me! Pretend!
- Be quiet, Alex.

458
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:15,330
- Sorry, Louis.
- Sorry, Louis.

459
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:19,197
- Thanks for the lift!
- See you around!

460
00:47:40,556 --> 00:47:42,717
Greetings, Starfighter.

461
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:47,752
You have been recruited by the Star League
to defend the frontier against Xur and...

462
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:11,610
- And, hey, what did you do to Maggie?
- Do to her?

463
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,918
We“re sittin“ outside lookin“ at the stars
and she sticks her tongue in my ear.

464
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:18,788
I screamed.
I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?

465
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:22,022
You“re not gonna be here. You“re
goin“ back with Centauri right now!

466
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:25,589
- What“s up, Alex?
- Back to sleep or I'm tellin“
Ma about your Playboys.

467
00:48:27,803 --> 00:48:30,294
- You“re blowin“ it, Alex!

468
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,608
- What the shit?
- I said, back to sleep, Louis...

469
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:42,014
or I'm tellin“ Ma about your Playboys!

470
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,848
Come in, Centauri.

471
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:47,922
Come on. Get back here.
And take your Tonka toy with ya.

472
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:50,719
Greetings, Starfighter!

473
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:54,262
You have been recruited by the Star
League to defend the frontier against...

474
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:57,423
Xur and the Kodan armada.

475
00:48:57,533 --> 00:48:59,467
Gree... Greetings, Starfighter!

476
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:03,869
You have been recruited by the Star League
to defend the-the frontier against Xur...

477
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,475
Where are ya?
Come on, where are ya?

478
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,013
Centauri?

479
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:16,084
Greetings, Starfighter!

480
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,085
Centauri?

481
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:21,348
Oh, shit!

482
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,850
Come on, Alex.
Don“t be such a wimp!

483
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:42,469
- Centauri, look out!
- What the...

484
00:51:09,932 --> 00:51:15,234
Whew! Foul stench!
Dirty creatures.

485
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,367
Get a good look, Alex.

486
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:23,172
You can bet your asteroids
you“ll be seeing more of them.

487
00:51:23,245 --> 00:51:26,442
- What?
- This is a Zando-Zan.

488
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:30,040
An interstellar hitbeast,
compliments of Xur.

489
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:32,679
Xur? Why is he after me?

490
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:34,688
Somehow he found out you“re a Starfighter.

491
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:38,453
So you see, Alex,
you gotta go back. You got no choice.

492
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,755
“Cause if you stay
down here, you“re dog meat.

493
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:43,660
Trust Centauri, my boy.
Because in two hours...

494
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:46,463
this place will be crawling
with ten Zando-Zans...

495
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:50,470
with just one thought on their
microscopic little minds:

496
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:54,167
- Kill Alex Rogan.
- Kill Alex Rogan.

497
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:58,269
He“s right, Alex. At least up there
you“ll have a fighting chance in a Gunstar.

498
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,747
Exactly. Meanwhile, down here,
they“ll be going after Beta.

499
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,819
- Beta. - Beta?
- Of course.

500
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,821
What do you think he“s here for?

501
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:08,823
Wait a...
Wait a second here, Centauri.

502
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:10,825
Alex, look out!

503
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:20,335
Centauri!

504
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:25,033
- Beta, get a doctor!
- No. No native cures. No witch doctors.

505
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:27,132
I'm fine.
Just a scratch.

506
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:34,041
Now face it, Alex.
You“re a born Starfighter.

507
00:52:35,884 --> 00:52:38,478
Are you with me?

508
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:50,854
Okay, let“s go, Centauri.

509
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,061
Good luck, Alex.

510
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:59,067
You too, Alex.

511
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:23,859
Centauri to Starfighter Command.

512
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:28,733
Centauri to Starfighter Command.
Come in, please.

513
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:45,385
Hey, Centauri.

514
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:54,158
All personnel.
Starcar is approaching Docking Gate 12.

515
00:53:54,262 --> 00:53:58,392
Centauri! Centauri!

516
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:04,402
Hey, hit the brakes!

517
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:11,536
- Grig! Hey, Grig!
- Alex!

518
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:13,637
They got Centauri.
He“s hurt!

519
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:15,706
He“s right over here.

520
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:29,960
Ah, you see?

521
00:54:30,065 --> 00:54:34,627
- Centauri brought him back!
- Yes, I see. Don“t talk.

522
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:39,572
- Does he have my money, Alex?
- I have a fortune for you, Centauri.

523
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,872
- Now, please be still.

524
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:45,936
It“s here. It“s all here.
Piles and piles of it.

525
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:48,948
All for you.

526
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,848
Ah.

527
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:55,345
At last.

528
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:58,757
Alex, I want you know...

529
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,727
it was for the greatest good
I brought you back.

530
00:55:03,598 --> 00:55:07,728
“Course, it-it...

531
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:13,139
It never hurts to be rich.

532
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:24,851
Until the next dimension, old friend.

533
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:28,519
I'm sorry, Alex.

534
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:30,525
Centauri?

535
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,558
Centauri?

536
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:42,728
The frontier could collapse at any moment.

537
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:45,830
Alex!

538
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:42,596
Now I need an ear job.

539
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:45,225
Dyin“ here. Dyin“.

540
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:02,273
Alex, what the helI's goin“ on?

541
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:07,788
Louis, you“re having a terrible
nightmare. Go back to sleep.

542
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:14,288
Louis!

543
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:29,833
Oh, no.

544
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:42,354
Am I to understand there“s a beta unit
taking your place back home?

545
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:45,051
- He“s trying.
- So it“s safe to assume...

546
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,128
that Xur thinks you“re still on Earth.

547
00:57:47,228 --> 00:57:49,662
Yeah.

548
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:52,427
That could work to our advantage...
theoretically.

549
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,069
Ah!
Now you look human!

550
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:07,712
- Is this my Gunstar?
- This is a prototype... different
from the other ships.

551
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:12,082
She has a greater range, more power,
and a slight weapons modification.

552
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:14,587
And of course, she“s got deflective plating...

553
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:17,624
so she can withstand several direct hits.

554
00:58:20,895 --> 00:58:23,193
- From here...

555
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:27,496
this is where I navigate the ship, maintain
life support and propulsion systems.

556
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:30,603
Okay. Where do I sit?

557
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:33,435
- Way up there, in the gunnery chair.

558
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:39,806
- Hang on!
- Okay.

559
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:47,715
Now, climb into the gunnery chair.

560
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:53,126
Now, I'm moving you into launch position.

561
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:57,221
There in front of you are the two switches
for your heads-up display. Turn them on.

562
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,307
While you“re engaging the enemy, the screen will
reflect all battle instruments toward you.

563
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:12,071
- Hey, where did it go?
- It“s still there, suspended in a Xenon mist.

564
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:16,573
- But it“s only visible if you look dead ahead.
- Ah. Got it.

565
00:59:16,618 --> 00:59:19,086
The lever on your left is the chair controller.

566
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,714
As you can see, all guns
will track with your every move.

567
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:32,392
Grasp the target control
with your right hand.

568
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:36,336
At your fingers is the weaponry:
The lasers, photon bolts...

569
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:39,396
Photon bolts and the particle beams.
Wait a minute. This is just like back home.

570
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:44,706
- What“s this?
- Careful, that“s Death Blossom,
a weapon of last resort.

571
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:47,805
Luckily, I was in here working on it
when the hangar went up.

572
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:51,307
Now, are you ready?
All systems... Go!

573
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:55,320
- Ignition!

574
00:59:58,526 --> 01:00:03,020
- Wh-When... When did the hangar go up?
- I told you: When Xur attacked.

575
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:05,964
- And where were the Starfighters?
- In the hangar!

576
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:10,630
- You mean they“re dead?
- Death is a primitive concept.

577
01:00:10,738 --> 01:00:15,835
I prefer to think of them
as battling evil in another dimension.

578
01:00:15,944 --> 01:00:18,174
In another dimension?
How many are left?

579
01:00:18,246 --> 01:00:21,340
- Including yourself?
- Yeah.

580
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:25,446
- One!
- One?

581
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:39,658
Hold it.

582
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:44,367
There“s no fleet, no Starfighters, no plan?

583
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:46,963
- One ship, you, me, and that“s it?
- Exactly!

584
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:50,374
Xur thinks you“re still on Earth. Classic
military strategy. Surprise attack.

585
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,912
- It“ll be a slaughter!
- That“s the spirit.

586
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:56,314
No, my slaughter.
One ship against the whole armada?

587
01:00:56,417 --> 01:01:00,012
Yes. One Gunstar against the armada.

588
01:01:00,121 --> 01:01:05,058
I've always wanted to fight a desperate
battle against incredible odds.

589
01:01:07,562 --> 01:01:10,030
- Target lights, Alex.
- Target lights?

590
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:13,623
Yes. You might want to squeeze off
a few rounds while you have a chance.

591
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:15,635
Just work the bugs out of the system.

592
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:18,365
After all, it is her maiden voyage.

593
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,424
Steady.
Don“t fight the chair.

594
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:45,421
Take your time. Watch your gun sight.
Lead your targets.

595
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:48,094
And above all, relax!

596
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:51,468
Terrific. I'm about to get killed
a million miles from nowhere...

597
01:01:51,506 --> 01:01:54,703
with a gung-ho iguana
who tells me, ““relax. ““

598
01:01:57,612 --> 01:02:00,376
Interstellar!

599
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:35,143
- Alex!
- Sorry.

600
01:02:37,752 --> 01:02:40,277
Okay, now, come on.
Ease it up.

601
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:45,549
Okay.

602
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,493
Oh, that“s... That“s it. Easy.

603
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:51,361
Nice and easy.
Yep.

604
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:54,993
- A little bit more and we“ll
get it in there, now.

605
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:58,072
- Alex!

606
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:00,802
Sorry.
Hi, Maggs.

607
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:05,208
- Alex, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

608
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:08,705
Come on.
Try it again.

609
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:14,013
Did you smell anything?

610
01:03:14,055 --> 01:03:17,149
- Like what?
- Like a Z...

611
01:03:17,225 --> 01:03:19,455
Forget it.

612
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:30,531
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for slapping you last night.

613
01:03:31,939 --> 01:03:33,907
Oh, that-that“s okay,
Maggs. Uh...

614
01:03:33,941 --> 01:03:36,341
I deserved it.
I'm sorry.

615
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:40,141
Well, maybe we can make it up
to each other tonight at Silver Lake?

616
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:12,208
- The armada will break
through the frontier here...

617
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:15,044
and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.

618
01:04:15,116 --> 01:04:17,516
Squadrons of deck fighters
will precede the mother ship.

619
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:19,552
Squadrons?
How many squadrons?

620
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,815
It isn“t the number of squadrons that concerns me.

621
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:25,324
It“s this communication turret that sends out
the commands to the deck fighters...

622
01:04:25,426 --> 01:04:27,724
which enables them to act
as one during the fight.

623
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:30,731
Wait a second. We knock out
the turret to get the fighters.

624
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:34,064
But to get the turret, we have to
get through the fighters. We“re dead.

625
01:04:34,168 --> 01:04:37,467
I'll have it all figured out
by the time we reach the frontier.

626
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:43,233
- What“s that?
- The frontier.

627
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:56,187
Strange. What“s a cargo ship doing
this close to the frontier?

628
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,191
Hail. This is Gunstar One.

629
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:08,601
I repeat, this is Gunstar One.
Identify yourself, please.

630
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:12,905
Alex, look out.

631
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,703
A Xurian ship!

632
01:05:19,814 --> 01:05:23,545
Congratulations, Alex.
This is your first live target.

633
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:25,949
Live?

634
01:05:29,023 --> 01:05:31,821
Within range in five klicks.
Get ready!

635
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:39,328
I've blocked its beam of frequency,
so it can“t report back to the armada.

636
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:43,334
- Fire when ready!
- Grig, wait!

637
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:55,645
We mustn“t lose them
in these caves, Alex! Fire!

638
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:22,108
Shoot, Alex!

639
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:28,309
Shoot!

640
01:06:35,923 --> 01:06:38,357
You did it!

641
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:48,325
I did it? You did it!
You almost got me killed!

642
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:53,672
Uh... My deepest
apologies, Alex.

643
01:06:53,774 --> 01:06:59,041
I had hoped that by putting you in the thick
of battle, a great Starfighter would emerge.

644
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:04,083
But alas. Perhaps... there was
never one within you to begin with.

645
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:08,587
I shall take you home.

646
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:14,183
You still may live
a long and fruitful life back there.

647
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:18,790
That is, until the Kodan reach Earth.

648
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,800
But then again...

649
01:07:31,646 --> 01:07:34,911
~ When it all goes wrong ~

650
01:07:35,016 --> 01:07:38,247
Hey, yo, Blake!
Make that sucker blast, man!

651
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,254
- You got it, dude! All right!
- Whoo!

652
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:45,258
~ You“ve seen things I never heard ~~

653
01:07:47,128 --> 01:07:49,824
So Blake comes back in
to grab his pants, right?

654
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:55,062
Sees her old lady, and says, ““I hope this
doesn“t rule out dinner on Tuesday night. ““

655
01:07:56,837 --> 01:07:58,737
That“s my man!

656
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:04,706
Alex, are you okay?

657
01:08:04,779 --> 01:08:08,772
Hmm?
Yeah, sure. Why?

658
01:08:08,883 --> 01:08:13,911
I don“t know. You“re just acting spaced
out. You“re... You“re not yourself.

659
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,918
Well, if you were me...

660
01:08:18,993 --> 01:08:21,291
what would you be doing right now?

661
01:08:24,131 --> 01:08:27,999
Well, for one thing,
I'd be trying to enjoy myself.

662
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,697
Leaning back.
Kidding around.

663
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:33,205
- Laughing.
- Laughing?

664
01:08:33,307 --> 01:08:35,241
Well, it“s a start, Alex.

665
01:08:35,343 --> 01:08:38,710
- Laughing.
~ There are things I'd like to say ~~

666
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,981
Nice place.
Reminds me of home.

667
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:28,894
- This reminds you of home?
- Oh, yes.

668
01:09:33,701 --> 01:09:36,226
I live below ground...

669
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:41,002
with my wifeoid and 6,000 little Griglings.

670
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:52,008
At least, until Xur
turns them into slaves.

671
01:09:57,058 --> 01:10:01,119
- Where does your kind live?
- Oh, uh, houses, mostly.

672
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,523
That“s caves above ground.

673
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:08,034
See, here.
Here“s my family.

674
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:11,828
See, that“s...

675
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:14,534
That“s my folks and my brother, Louis...

676
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:16,873
and that“s Maggie.

677
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,247
Uh, we live
in a mobile home.

678
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:25,175
That“s a cave that...
that goes places.

679
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:27,754
Only we never went anyplace.

680
01:10:29,857 --> 01:10:33,850
A mobile cave that never went anywhere.
Fascinating.

681
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:37,954
Yeah, but we have below-ground caves
near the trailer parks.

682
01:10:37,998 --> 01:10:40,967
Me and my brother, Louis,
used to play hide-and-seek in “em.

683
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:44,771
Hide-and-seek.

684
01:10:44,872 --> 01:10:47,773
- What is it, Alex?
- Well, I was just thinkin“...

685
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,809
maybe we could hide here...

686
01:10:49,877 --> 01:10:54,075
Let the armada pass by,
and then hit the turret from behind.

687
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:56,379
Then we might take them by surprise.

688
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:04,217
Your plan might really have worked.

689
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:08,159
What a pity there are no Starfighters
left to carry it out.

690
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:11,163
Yeah. Yeah.

691
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,638
A Xurian base!

692
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:41,355
Two more dead ahead!
Closing fast!

693
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:08,215
- Earth course is logged
into navigational beams.

694
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:14,550
- Grig?
- What is it, Alex?

695
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:22,064
Maybe there is a Starfighter left.

696
01:13:01,575 --> 01:13:04,635
Ow!

697
01:13:10,618 --> 01:13:13,416
What“s wrong? Should I
put my tongue in your ear now?

698
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,148
Don“t bother, Alex.

699
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:19,124
Well, it“s just... I'm kind of new
at these gland games.

700
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:22,721
What are you talking about?

701
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,355
It“s like you“re a million miles away, Alex!

702
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:37,942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Darling.

703
01:13:38,045 --> 01:13:40,946
Darling, forgive me.

704
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:52,648
Darling, forgive me.

705
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:58,256
Come on!

706
01:13:58,365 --> 01:14:01,163
You“re my Juliet.
My Venus.

707
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:09,198
You“re my Juliet.
My Venus.

708
01:14:12,646 --> 01:14:16,707
- Alex!
- All the other girls meant nothing to me.

709
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,810
It was you, you, you.

710
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,822
Shut up and talk dirty to me.

711
01:14:23,857 --> 01:14:26,826
The other girls meant
nothing to me. It was you...

712
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:29,420
you, y...

713
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:33,126
- Should I talk dirty to you now?

714
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:38,535
- That does it.
- Oh, God. All right. I give up.

715
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:41,039
- I'm not Alex Rogan.
- What?

716
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:44,440
I'm a beta unit.
I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.

717
01:14:44,545 --> 01:14:47,639
He“s up there saving the universe,
while I'm down here for target practice.

718
01:14:49,783 --> 01:14:52,251
- See?

719
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:02,486
- Alex! Or whatever you are. Wait. Wait.

720
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:05,293
What are you d... Let me go. If that Zando-Zan
reports back that I'm not Alex...

721
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:07,300
Alex is in big trouble!

722
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:10,098
- You“re stayin“ here.
- No, I'm not going anywhere until
I find out what“s going on!

723
01:15:12,606 --> 01:15:14,631
Hey, my truck!

724
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:17,006
- Hey, hey, come back!

725
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:20,405
Scratch that paint, and you“re dead, Rogan!

726
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:32,517
Ready to invade, Commander.

727
01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:36,653
- Invade.
- The Xurian ships have not
answered our invasion code.

728
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:41,064
The frontier is down, the moon is eclipsed,
the Starfighters are dead. Invade!

729
01:15:42,536 --> 01:15:46,438
All squadrons ahead, half speed,
with energy probes on.

730
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,628
Energy probe.
Shut down, Alex. Shut down.

731
01:16:19,706 --> 01:16:22,197
- Power off.

732
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,817
Alex? In space?

733
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:46,627
- Is this for real?
- Yes! That“s what I'm trying to tell you!

734
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:50,032
- It“s all for real!
- Well, then, don“t talk. Drive!

735
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:05,708
Commander Kril, we“re getting
a signal on the alert frequency.

736
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:08,686
- Acknowledge.

737
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:14,024
There it is. All right. Now, when
I give the signal, we“re gonna jump!

738
01:17:14,128 --> 01:17:17,291
- What do you mean, ““jump““?
- We“re gonna ram him. - What?

739
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:21,297
Extermination Emissary
Zeta-six one message:

740
01:17:21,401 --> 01:17:23,335
- Ready?
- Jump!

741
01:17:23,437 --> 01:17:26,406
Alex!

742
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:30,307
- The last Starfighter...

743
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,901
You owe me one, Alex.

744
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:42,352
- Alex!

745
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:44,720
Transmission pulsars
have stopped, Commander.

746
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:49,320
- The last Starfighter...
- Is dead!

747
01:17:49,429 --> 01:17:52,330
The last Starfighter
is dead!

748
01:17:52,432 --> 01:17:56,459
Nothing can stop us now.
Ahead full. To Rylos!

749
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,320
The command ship!

750
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:27,200
There!
The turret at the far end!

751
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:30,293
I see it.

752
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:37,001
- Good luck, Starfighter.
- Thanks, Grig. For everything.

753
01:18:50,624 --> 01:18:53,525
I love you,
Alex Rogan.

754
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:56,425
- Six.

755
01:18:56,463 --> 01:18:59,125
- Heads up display. Check.
- Five.

756
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:02,760
- Lasers. Check. - Four.
- Particle beam. Check.

757
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:05,167
- Three.
- Proton bolts. Check.

758
01:19:05,272 --> 01:19:07,672
- Two.
- Chair control. Check.

759
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:10,871
- One.
- Let“s do it.

760
01:19:21,288 --> 01:19:24,086
- Tracking alert.

761
01:19:26,627 --> 01:19:29,528
Unidentified craft.
What is it?

762
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:37,698
Wait. Gunstar!

763
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:42,107
So... the last Starfighter
is dead?

764
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:46,512
This has gone far enough.
Seize him!

765
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:51,314
How dare you?
I am the Emperor of Rylos!

766
01:19:51,418 --> 01:19:54,353
I and I alone command this entire op...

767
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:57,150
Release me!
I command you!

768
01:19:57,224 --> 01:20:00,216
You will pay for this with your lives!

769
01:20:00,327 --> 01:20:03,228
All guns... fire!

770
01:20:12,673 --> 01:20:14,937
There it is... the turret!

771
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:18,274
Alex, now!

772
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:22,041
- Yeah!
- Got it!

773
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:25,574
Hurry, Alex! Fire!
The armada“s almost to Rylos!

774
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:47,406
Hatchway to pod activated.

775
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:51,310
Escape pod ignition.

776
01:20:51,378 --> 01:20:55,678
The Gunstar is gone from our sensors.
Alert wing commanders.

777
01:20:55,782 --> 01:20:58,808
Communication turret is destroyed.

778
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:06,724
All communication radar systems
are out, Wing Commander.

779
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:10,422
Proceed with a visual attack formation.

780
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:18,368
- Life support good. Ammo packs at peak.

781
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:20,372
I think we“ve got to use Death Blossom.

782
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:23,932
Remember, Death Blossom delivers
only one massive volley at close range.

783
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:27,844
- Theoretically.
- What do you mean, ““Theoretically““?

784
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:29,872
After all, D.B.
Has never been tested.

785
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,748
It might overload the systems.
Blow up the ship.

786
01:21:32,786 --> 01:21:35,482
What are you worried about?
Theoretically, we should already be dead.

787
01:21:35,589 --> 01:21:37,750
- Hmm. Mmm.

788
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:41,056
Open Death Blossom petals.
Switch is on.

789
01:21:55,308 --> 01:21:57,572
Do not trigger D.B.
Until we“re within range.

790
01:21:57,611 --> 01:22:00,171
Just use your lasers until I give the signal.

791
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,714
- Remember...
- I've been recruited by the Star League...

792
01:22:02,816 --> 01:22:05,011
to defend the frontier.

793
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:08,747
- Now, are you ready?
- This is it. Here we go.

794
01:22:08,822 --> 01:22:11,620
Charge!

795
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:42,644
On your right!

796
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:45,657
Your left!

797
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:48,853
Evade!

798
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:53,389
Power packs are low!
We need time to recharge!

799
01:22:55,502 --> 01:22:58,869
Laser power draining!

800
01:23:05,812 --> 01:23:09,111
Grig, my weapons are gone!
Should I do it?

801
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:13,414
Easy, easy. Wait till they“re
all in Death Blossom range!

802
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:23,962
Fire!

803
01:23:56,663 --> 01:24:00,895
- We did it.
- Yes, we actually did, didn“t we?

804
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:06,495
The command ship!

805
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:09,805
Our guns are out.
Damage control is repairing them.

806
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:13,607
Forget the guns!
Ramming speed!

807
01:24:21,655 --> 01:24:25,113
- Grig, we need power!
- Death Blossom“s drained all power.

808
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:29,219
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to ram boost.

809
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:35,428
All we have left is life support power!

810
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:45,341
- Grig!

811
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:52,543
All right!

812
01:24:58,358 --> 01:25:02,089
Weapons on! Target now! Fire. Fire!

813
01:25:24,517 --> 01:25:26,815
Damage report!

814
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,118
Guidance system out.
Auxiliary steering out.

815
01:25:31,157 --> 01:25:34,957
Divert!
Divert!

816
01:25:35,028 --> 01:25:38,930
She won“t answer the helm! We“re locked
in the moon“s gravitational pull!

817
01:25:39,032 --> 01:25:41,830
What do we do?

818
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:45,836
- We die.

819
01:25:56,249 --> 01:25:58,149
Yahoo!

820
01:26:07,193 --> 01:26:10,094
On behalf of the Star League
and all citizens of Rylos...

821
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:13,461
I congratulate you on your dazzling victory.

822
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,468
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

823
01:26:15,502 --> 01:26:18,801
But as you know, the frontier is down...

824
01:26:18,905 --> 01:26:22,136
Xur escaped, and there is still danger.

825
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,301
So I was wondering if you
wouldn“t be willing to stay on...

826
01:26:24,344 --> 01:26:27,006
and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.

827
01:26:27,047 --> 01:26:29,015
Wait a minute.

828
01:26:29,049 --> 01:26:32,018
- Rebuild the Legion?
- Yes.

829
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:37,251
Of course, you“d have
the help of an old friend.

830
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:39,518
An old friend?
Who?

831
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:57,737
Centauri!
I thought you were dead!

832
01:26:57,844 --> 01:27:01,780
Me die and miss all the excitement?
Oh, no.

833
01:27:01,815 --> 01:27:05,979
I was merely dormant while my body repaired
itself. I won“t bore you with details.

834
01:27:06,086 --> 01:27:10,614
Suffice it to say, you“re on Rylos,
my boy. Stop thinking human.

835
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:14,592
That“s lesson number one.
Now, lesson number two...

836
01:27:14,627 --> 01:27:18,688
You“ve got a good thing going here.
Keep smiling. Don“t blow it.

837
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:22,325
Lesson number three...
Always trust Centauri.

838
01:27:26,906 --> 01:27:28,999
Alex, they love you!

839
01:27:33,113 --> 01:27:37,550
See? All Rylos is behind you.

840
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:41,347
- You“ve got to stay, Alex!
- You will stay, won“t you?

841
01:27:41,454 --> 01:27:44,287
Of course he“ll stay.

842
01:27:44,324 --> 01:27:48,920
That“s very reassuring, Centauri.
Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.

843
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,624
I'll stay.

844
01:28:04,811 --> 01:28:08,269
Alex! Alex!

845
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:26,289
Greetings... Greetings, starfighter.

846
01:28:26,332 --> 01:28:29,233
- Bunny, have you seen Alex?
- Can“t say that I have.

847
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:33,705
Well, ask Maggie. She knows
where he is. She was with him.

848
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:36,002
Maggie, where“s Alex?

849
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:38,306
Yeah, where“s my truck?
Where“s your boyfriend?

850
01:28:38,344 --> 01:28:42,508
- Mrs. Rogan, about Alex: You see, he“s...

851
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:46,716
- What is it?
- What“s going on? I don“t know.

852
01:29:09,075 --> 01:29:11,066
Oh, my God!

853
01:29:12,512 --> 01:29:15,879
Whoo! All right!
We“re being invaded!

854
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:46,304
Maggie.

855
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:48,314
Maggie.

856
01:30:50,009 --> 01:30:53,069
- Alex?
- Hi, Maggs.

857
01:30:54,213 --> 01:30:58,479
Alex, is it you?

858
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:01,485
I mean, is it really you?

859
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:08,517
Look!

860
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:10,994
My God.

861
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:12,998
It is you.

862
01:31:13,032 --> 01:31:15,523
- It“s Alex! Alex!

863
01:31:15,635 --> 01:31:19,036
- Alex, what is going on here?
What is this thing?

864
01:31:24,744 --> 01:31:28,646
- Is this a spaceship?

865
01:31:28,748 --> 01:31:31,945
- I don“t know what“s gotten into him.
- I don“t understand that.

866
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:35,179
- It“s so strange!
- Wait. Hold it. Hold it, everybody.

867
01:31:35,254 --> 01:31:38,553
Alex, what is all this?

868
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,058
I, uh... I've been
to another planet, Ma.

869
01:31:43,162 --> 01:31:47,258
- Another planet?
- Who was it helped fix my antenna?

870
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:49,767
- Yeah, who stole my truck?
- And cut my electric?

871
01:31:49,869 --> 01:31:53,703
- And ruined my stove?
- Oh, that was... That was a beta unit.

872
01:31:53,773 --> 01:31:56,298
- Beta unit?
- A robot.

873
01:31:56,376 --> 01:31:58,503
- Robot? What the...
- Come on!

874
01:31:58,611 --> 01:32:01,102
- A monster!

875
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:06,049
- A monster! Hah!

876
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:10,249
- He got them chains on him.
- All right! It“s an alien!

877
01:32:10,356 --> 01:32:13,757
Oh, no, wait! Hey, hey! Granny, put away
that shotgun. What“s wrong with you?

878
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,727
This is my friend Grig. I want you all
to meet my friend here.

879
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:20,321
- You gotta be kiddin“!
- Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.

880
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:24,058
- Hello.
- Hello.

881
01:32:24,137 --> 01:32:26,435
- And, uh, this is Elvira.
- Delighted.

882
01:32:26,472 --> 01:32:29,168
- Me too. How you doin“?
- I do well.

883
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:32,040
- And this is Granny.
- How do you do?

884
01:32:32,145 --> 01:32:34,045
- How do you do?

885
01:32:34,147 --> 01:32:36,547
- And this here“s Otis.
- A pleasure.

886
01:32:36,649 --> 01:32:40,050
Any friend of Alex...

887
01:32:40,153 --> 01:32:43,281
- And, uh, this is Maggie.

888
01:32:43,356 --> 01:32:45,654
A very large pleasure.

889
01:32:45,758 --> 01:32:47,692
Hi.

890
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:53,897
You must be Louis!

891
01:32:56,169 --> 01:32:58,763
I hear good things about you.

892
01:32:58,805 --> 01:33:01,569
Hear that, you slimes?
I'm famous.

893
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:06,203
And, uh, this is my mom.

894
01:33:09,115 --> 01:33:12,209
You should be proud
of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.

895
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:15,151
You must all be proud of him.
He saved the Star League...

896
01:33:15,254 --> 01:33:17,950
and hundreds of worlds, including Earth.

897
01:33:18,024 --> 01:33:21,152
- Oh, for heaven“s sake!
- Oh, my God!

898
01:33:23,329 --> 01:33:25,456
Time to leave, Alex.

899
01:33:25,565 --> 01:33:28,534
- Alex?
- I have to, Ma.

900
01:33:28,634 --> 01:33:32,092
- They need me up there.
- Oh, Alex, I always knew you“d leave someday...

901
01:33:32,138 --> 01:33:34,629
but I never expected this.

902
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,970
Gee, can I go too, Alex?
Can I?

903
01:33:37,076 --> 01:33:39,510
Sorry, squirt.
There“s only enough room up there...

904
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:43,379
for me, Grig and Maggie.

905
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:47,249
- Me?
- Yeah.

906
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:50,186
Alex, l...
I don“t think I can...

907
01:33:50,256 --> 01:33:52,747
Come here.
Come here.

908
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:55,054
Why else do you think I came back?

909
01:33:55,094 --> 01:33:57,858
- Well...
- Didn“t we say we“d always be together?

910
01:33:57,897 --> 01:34:01,560
Well, yeah... I mean,
together here or in the city.

911
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:03,532
But...
But up there, Alex...

912
01:34:03,603 --> 01:34:06,731
Maggs, you gotta come. You see, I'm not...
I don“t know when I'm gonna be back.

913
01:34:08,307 --> 01:34:10,275
Don“t you see? This is it.
This is our big chance.

914
01:34:10,309 --> 01:34:12,539
It“s like what Otis says...

915
01:34:12,612 --> 01:34:15,911
When it comes you gotta grab on
with both hands and hold tight.

916
01:34:19,051 --> 01:34:22,851
Well, what about Granny, Alex?

917
01:34:26,425 --> 01:34:30,191
You“re right.
I'm scared of leaving here.

918
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:32,197
Why can“t you just stay?

919
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,667
Maggie, I have to leave,
and I want you to come with me.

920
01:34:39,038 --> 01:34:42,838
Alex! Hurry!

921
01:34:46,045 --> 01:34:48,639
- Well, I gotta go.
- Um...

922
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:53,441
Bye.

923
01:34:57,456 --> 01:34:59,583
Alex, we can“t hold off
their radar any longer.

924
01:34:59,659 --> 01:35:01,684
Yeah, okay.
I gotta go, Ma.

925
01:35:01,727 --> 01:35:03,695
- Bye. Take it easy.
- Bye, darling.

926
01:35:03,729 --> 01:35:05,697
So long.
So long, everybody.

927
01:35:05,731 --> 01:35:07,790
- Bye, Alex!
- Bye!

928
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:11,700
Bye, Alex. Bye, Alex!

929
01:35:20,746 --> 01:35:22,805
Alex!

930
01:35:22,848 --> 01:35:25,840
Granny...

931
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:29,649
Be sure and write,
or whatever it is they do up there.

932
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,928
Alex!
Wait, Alex!

933
01:35:55,982 --> 01:35:57,973
- Get back! Come on!
- Bye!

934
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,984
- Keep your distance!
- Watch what you“re doing.

935
01:36:00,052 --> 01:36:03,681
Keep your distance, now.
This baby really packs a punch!

936
01:36:07,793 --> 01:36:09,727
Look at him!
Bye!

937
01:36:13,799 --> 01:36:19,203
Oh, go on. They“re gonna be
happy up there! So long, Alex!

938
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:22,730
- So long, Alex!

939
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:29,007
- We“re gonna be famous, aren“t we, Otis?
- Yes, sir!

940
01:36:29,048 --> 01:36:32,643
The whole world... the whole universe...
is gonna know about us!

941
01:36:32,718 --> 01:36:37,712
Starlite, Starbrite... The place where
Alex and Maggie left for the stars!

942
01:36:37,823 --> 01:36:40,656
Louis!
Louis!

943
01:36:40,726 --> 01:36:44,162
Greetings, Starfighter. You have been
recruited by the Star League...

944
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:48,030
to defend the frontier against Xur
and the Kodan Armada.

945
01:36:55,574 --> 01:36:58,065
Wow!
