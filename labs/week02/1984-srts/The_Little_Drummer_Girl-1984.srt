        THE PALESTINIANS        
        HAVE BEEN WRONGED.      

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,847
        THEY'VE BEEN            
        DRIVEN OFF LAND         

111
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,416
        THEY'VE OWNED           
        FOR CENTURIES.          

112
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,685
SIT DOWN!                       
PLEASE.                         

113
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,888
IF HE SOLD                      
HIS CLOTHES,                    

114
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,192
HE COULD                        
AFFORD HIS OWN                  
BLOODY PLANE.                   

115
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,262
EVEN WITH ONE                   
PALESTINIAN LEFT,               
WE WILL FIGHT.                  

116
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,033
WE WILL                         
FIGHT WITH WHAT                 
WEAPONS WE HAVE.                

117
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:13,638
WE ASK THE RETURN               
OF LANDS TAKEN BY               
FORCE AND TERROR.               

118
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,774
WE ASK FOR JUSTICE.             

119
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,009
THAT'S ALL.                     

120
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,414
            I'M SURE            
        WE APPRECIATE           

121
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,083
        THAT OUR SPEAKER        
        NAMED MICHEL,

    HAS COME AT GREAT RISK.     

123
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,821
        HE WON'T ATTEND         
        SUNDAY'S SEMINAR,       

124
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,890
    BUT WE HOPE ONE DAY,        

125
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,527
    HE CAN RETURN FREELY        
    AND WITHOUT SUBTERFUGE.

THANK YOU.

BLOODY TERRORIST AT THAT.       

133
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,596

        UNDER SURVEILLANCE      

134
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,965
        SINCE HE RETURNED       
        FROM ENGLAND.           

135
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,302
        HE IS KHALIL'S          
    YOUNGEST BROTHER, MICHEL.   

136

    MICHEL DELIVERS THEM.

    THIS OTHER SIDE OF HIM.     

144
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,159

280
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,130
                I'M NOT SURE    
                I UNDERSTAND.   

281
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,666
WHERE'S

                CONFUSE ME WITH 
                SOMEBODY ELSE.  

285
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,012
I DON'T MISTAKE FACES.          

286
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,682
                I'VE NEVER BEEN 
                IN NOTTINGHAM.  

287
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,542
                I'M             
                NOT AN ACTOR.   

288

WE'RE PLAYING EVEN.             

291
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,287
                YOU'RE          
                A TRUE ACTRESS. 

292
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,223
JUST LOOK                       
AS IF THE WINE                  

293
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,026
WAS MAKING US                   
WANT TO SCREW.                  

294
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:46,664
THAT DOESN'T                    
TAKE MUCH ACTING,               
DOES IT?                        

295
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,802
                SOME WINE.      

296
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,403
                CHEERS.         

297

EXCUSE ME.                      
I'LL BE BACK.                   

298
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,308
                OF COURSE,      
                BUT...          

299
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,343
                I'LL BE BACK.   

300
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,953
I HAVE TO                       
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.               

301
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,456
                YOU GAVE ME     
                MY NAME.        

302
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,492
                PLEASE          
                HAVE A SEAT.    

303
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,466
                WOULD YOU       
                LIKE A GLASS?   

304
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,867
WHAT IS IT?                     

305
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,335
                PUTARI WINE.    

306
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,170
                WHITE AND COLD. 

307
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,540
AS LONG                         
AS IT'S NOT APOLLO.             

308
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,109
    UH...                       

309
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:39,450
I HEARD YOU SPEAK               
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO               
IN DORSET.                      

310
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,303
I WAS IMPRESSED.                

311
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,155
IT WAS STUPID                   
TO THINK YOU'D                  
REVEAL YOUR IDENTITY.           

312
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,859
I SHOULDN'T                     
HAVE CHALLENGED YOU.            

313
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,361
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.            

314
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,664
                I SHOULD CALL   
                YOU CHARLIE?    

315
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,668
    YES.                        

316
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,472
                IS THIS FILMING 
                FOR A TELEVISION
                COMMERCIAL?     

317

                ANYBODY         
                WHO KIDNAPS ME  
                IS A FRIEND!    

533
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,046
                YOU JUST        
                WAIT A MINUTE!  

534
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,782
                YOU'VE GOT      
                THE WRONG GIRL. 

535
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,617
                I'M NOT A JEW!  

536
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,586
                I AM            
                PRO-PALESTINIAN!

537
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,189
WE RESPECT                      
YOUR POLITICS.                  

538
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,957
            GIVE THE ARABS BACK 

539
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,260
            THE LAND            
            YOU STOLE FROM THEM.

540
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,831
WHERE WOULD                     
YOU HAVE US GO, CHARLIE?        

541
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,533
MAYBE CENTRAL AFRICA            
OR URUGUAY?                     

542
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,669
NOT EGYPT, THANK YOU.           

543
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:42,339
WE TRIED IT ONCE                
UNSUCCESSFULLY.                 

544
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,042
OR BACK TO THE GHETTOS.         

545
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,177
            I JUST WANT PEACE.  

546
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,412
SO DO WE.                       

547
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,781
THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE YOU.        

548
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:51,982
            FOR WHAT?           

549
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:55,052
TO OFFER YOU                    
AN ACTING JOB.                  

550
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,053
                        IN WHAT?

551
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:59,623
IT'S THE BIGGEST PART           
YOU'VE EVER HAD.                

552
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,659
THE MOST DEMANDING              
AND IMPORTANT.                  

553
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:05,295
                AM I SUPPOSED   
                TO KILL ARABS?  

554
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:07,664
WE WOULD NEVER                  
ASK THAT.                       

555
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,132
            CHARLIE...          

556
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,300
        HEAR US OUT.            

557
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:14,137
        IF AFTER THAT           
        YOU WANT TO GO,         

558
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,206
        YOU'RE FREE.            

559
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,542
            DO I HAVE A CHOICE? 

560
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,277
AFTER THE AUDITION.             

561
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,812
        WHAT SORT OF AUDITION?  

562
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:26,917
YOU WILL ANSWER                 
A STRING OF QUESTIONS           
VERY FRANKLY,                   

563
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,452
VERY TRUTHFULLY.                

564
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,553
DON'T EVALUATE.                 

565
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,857
IF YOU STILL WANT               
TO LEAVE AFTER THAT,            

566
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,259
AS JOSEPH INDICATED,            

567
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,996
YOU WILL HAVE THAT OPTION.      

568
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,832
                    UH-HUH.     

569
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,945
                    ALL RIGHT.  

570
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,514
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.           

571
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:02,019
    WE BEGIN WITH A LITTLE      
        FAMILY HISTORY.         

572
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,022
        YOUR FATHER             
        BORN, WHEN?             

573
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,990
MY FATHER?                      

574
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,593
OH, GOD.                        

575
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,261
    UH...                       

576
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,230
    1925.                       

577
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,501
        THE HEADMISTRESS        
        SENT FOR YOU.           

578
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:20,137
    SO, WHAT DID SHE SAY?       

579
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,204
WAIT A MINUTE.                  

580
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:25,042
"PACK YOUR THINGS,              
GOOD-BYE, GOOD LUCK,"           

581
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,810
AS FAR AS I REMEMBER.           

582
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:31,882
    NO EXPLANATION OF WHY       
    THEY ASKED YOU TO LEAVE?    

583
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:33,717
IT WAS A SCANDAL.               

584
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,852
THE TUITION                     
HADN'T BEEN PAID.               

585
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,120
THEY'RE IN BUSINESS.            

586
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,358
LET'S CALL THIS                 
A DAY OR A NIGHT.               

587
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,128
        YOU SAID YOU            
    RETURNED HOME TO...         

588
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,931
CHAOS. POLICE                   
SWARMING THE HOUSE,             

589
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,000
MY MOTHER CRYING.               

590
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,768
        WHERE WAS               
        YOUR SISTER?            

591
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,371
SHE WAS                         
PREGNANT, AS USUAL.             

592
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,441
        SHE WASN'T              
    PREGNANT THAT YEAR.         

593
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,875
I DON'T REMEMBER!               

594
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,244
IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO!           

595
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,547
MAYBE SHE                       
COULDN'T FACE IT.               

596
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,883
        THE DISGRACE OF         
    YOUR FATHER'S TRIAL?        

597
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,685
WHAT ELSE                       
WAS THERE?                      

598
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,321
        CONTINUE IN             
        YOUR OWN WORDS.         

599
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,891
    WHAT ELSE DO WE SEE?        

600
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,661
MY PONY. THEY                   
TOOK MY PONY.                   

601
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,895
    WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?        

602
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,864
IN PRISON.                      
I TOLD YOU.                     

603
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:24,101
        YES. OF COURSE,         
        YOU TOLD ME.            

604
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,003
        LET'S SEE...UM...       

605
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,137
            THE VISIT.          

606
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,140
        WHO TOOK YOU            
        ON VISITING DAY?        

607
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,408
I NEVER WENT.                   

608
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,644
I TOOK CARE                     
OF MY MOTHER.                   

609
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,246
THE PRISON...                   

610
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,016
CHRIST, I                       
COULD NEVER VISIT.              

611
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,384
I REMEMBER...                   

612
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:44,021
WHEN HE                         
SHOWED UP...                    

613
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,990
WE'D MOVED                      
TO BALTIMORE.                   

614
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,093
WE WERE ON WELFARE,             

615
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:55,232
AND HE JUST SHOWED UP           
A MONTH EARLY.                  

616
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:59,436
HE LOOKED                       
SLIMMER, YOUNGER,               

617
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,339
HE GAVE ME A HUG                

618
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,309
AND WEPT.                       

619
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,278
MOTHER WAS UPSTAIRS,            
TOO SCARED TO COME DOWN.        

620
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,515
I REMEMBER.                     

621
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,319
HE WAS FUNNY                    
ABOUT THE DOORS.                

622
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,488
HE COULDN'T                     
OPEN THEM.                      

623
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,090
HE'D JUST...                    

624
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,627
HE'D GO UP TO THEM              
AND THEN HE'D...                

625
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:29,399
STAND AT ATTENTION              
WITH HIS FEET TOGETHER,         
HIS HEAD HELD DOWN,             

626
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:35,305
AND HE'D WAIT FOR               
THE GUARD TO UNLOCK THE DOOR.   

627
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,974
THE FIRST                       
TIME I SAW IT,                  

628
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:43,346
I SCREAMED AT HIM               
TO OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR.       

629
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,356
        YOU GAVE                
        AN INTERVIEW,           

630
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,676
        THE IPSWICH PAPER,      

631
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,995
DESCRIBING STANDING OUTSIDE HIS 
    CELL BLOCK, WAVING TO HIM.  

632
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:03,500
I WAS...                        
SAUCING IT UP.                  

633
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,534
        YOUR AGENT SAID         

634
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,939
        YOUR FATHER DIED        
    IN PRISON, NOT AT HOME.     

635
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,874
    MORE SAUCING IT UP.         

636
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,977
THAT'S NED TALKING,             
NOT ME.                         

637
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,746
HOW AM I DOING?                 

638
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,721
SO? WHAT?                       
DOESN'T ANYBODY                 
SLEEP AROUND HERE?              

639
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,723
NO, HUH?                        

640

            [TELETYPE PRINTING] 

641
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,831
        THAT WEEKEND            
        FORUM IN DORSET--       

642
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,299
    YOU MENTIONED KHALIL.       

643
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,101
IT WASN'T                       
THAT SERIOUS.                   

644
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:41,938
        HOW MANY TIMES          
        DID YOU SEE HIM?        

645
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,340
                ONCE, A COUPLE? 

646
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,609
    WOULD YOU REVISE IT?        

647
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,077
            FOUR?               

648
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,411
A COUPLE.                       

649
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,014
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.             

650
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:53,817
        SIGN ANYTHING?          

651
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,652
    STATEMENTS? PETITIONS?      

652
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,653
    NO.                         

653
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,423
        THERE'S ALWAYS          
    A RESOLUTION TO SIGN.       

654
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,559
        BE REASONABLE.          

655
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:03,660
UH, I...                        

656
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,429
        TELL US, WHAT           
        WAS DISCUSSED?          

657
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,697
I DON'T REMEMBER.               

658
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,866
                HER DIARY       
                DESCRIBES FOUR. 

659
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,501
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?           

660
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,471
    FOUR? CHARLIE'S LOSING      
        MY CONFIDENCE.          

661
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:18,742
HE HAS NO RIGHT                 
TO TAKE MY DIARY!               

662
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:20,577
I DON'T WANT THIS!              

663
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,281
I HATE THIS                     
AND I HATE YOU!                 

664
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,415
I'M GETTING OUT!                

665
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:29,786
YOU TOLD ME                     
I COULD LISTEN AND LEAVE.       

666
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,154
I WANT OUT NOW!                 

667
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:35,158
    YOUR OPTIONS OPERATE        
    ONLY WHEN WE INVITE YOU.    

668
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,929
YOU'VE KEPT ME                  
THE WHOLE GODDAMN NIGHT!        

669
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,197
    THERE'S DISCREPANCIES.      

670
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,166
        YOUR FATHER NEVER       
        WENT TO PRISON.         

671
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,670
    NO DEPUTIES, NO PONY        
        TAKEN FROM YOU.         

672
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,606
        YOU ATTENDED            
    PUBLIC SCHOOL IN IOWA,      

673
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,909
    NOT A FANCY PRIVATE SCHOOL  
            IN VIRGINIA.        

674
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:58,081
    YOUR FATHER WORKED UNTIL    
HE DIED IN A MORTGAGE OFFICE.   

675
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,585
    YOUR ONLY SCANDAL WAS       
    A SCHOOL SUSPENSION         

676
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,956
    FOR BEING TOO AVAILABLE     
        TO THE LOCAL BOYS.      

677
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:09,125
    WHY DO YOU LIE TO US?       

678
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,194
        WHY NOT TRUST US?       

679
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,762
TRUST? YOU BASTARD!             

680
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,264
YOU'RE THE ONE!                 

681
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,800
YOU FUCK, YOU!                  

682
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:21,004
YOU BASTARD!                    

683
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,006
            THREE MINUTES,      
            NOT MORE.           

684
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,876
            SHE DOESN'T PUT ON  
            SOME NEW IDENTITY,  

685
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,512
            SHE COMES BACK IN!  

686
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:34,117
    CHARLIE,                    
    STOP FOR A MINUTE.          

687
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,318
    WAIT!                       

688
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,354
    I SAID, STOP!               

689
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,889
    YOU DID WELL.               

690
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:40,690
    CONGRATULATIONS.            

691
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:44,527
    YOU TOOK A DIVE,            
    BUT YOU RECOVERED.          

692
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,296
    YOU LOST YOUR WAY,          

693
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,431
    BUT YOU HUNG IN THERE.      

694
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:52,869
    WHEN THE LINE BROKE,        
    YOU BLAMED THE WORLD.       

695
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,437
    WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.         

696
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,208
    NEXT TIME,                  
    YOU'LL TELL                 
    A BETTER STORY.             

697
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,111
    HURRY BACK.                 
    TIME IS SHORT.              

698
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,279
MONTY.                          

699
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,179
        YES?                    

700

HEARD FROM JERUSALEM.           

701

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.             

702
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,120
    SHE'S EVERYTHING            
    WE WANT--                   

703
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,156
    BRIGHT, CREATIVE,           
    UNDERUSED, ROMANTIC...      

704
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,424
                AND A LIAR.     

705
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,860
    TONIGHT SHE LIES            
    FOR HERSELF.                

706

    TOMORROW                    
    SHE LIES FOR US.            

707
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:23,166
    DO WE WANT                  
    AN ANGEL SUDDENLY?          

708
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,172
    NOW LISTEN TO THIS.         

709
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:34,577
    MISHA GAVON SAYS WE ARE     
    TO POSE AS AMERICANS.       

710
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,712
    ISN'T THAT NICE?            

711
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,816
    "ON NO ACCOUNT              
    WILL YOU ADMIT TO HER       

712
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,085
    "THAT YOU                   
    ARE ISRAELI SUBJECTS        

713
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:46,156
    ACTING IN OFFICAL           
    OR NEAR OFFICAL CAPACITY."  

714
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,190
    I LOVE IT.                  

715
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,260
    THAT'S HELPFUL, HUH?        
    AND SO TIMELY.              

716
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:53,363
    CABLE THEM "YES"--          
    REPEAT "NO!"                

717
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:57,667
    TIME FOR YOU                
    TO TAKE OVER.               

718
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,571
            HE HAS LOST IT.     

719
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,540
            I KNOW THE SIGNS.   

720
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,442
HE'S A GREAT FIGHTER.           

721
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,744
I NEVER KNEW                    
ANYONE BETTER                   

722
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,913
FOR DARK NIGHTS                 
EXCEPT YOU.                     

723
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,716
        WE SHOULD'VE USED       
        THE JEWISH GIRL.        

724
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,185
            SURELY, THEY'LL     
            CHECK HER PAST.     

725
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,754
            WE NEED THE         
            GENUINE ARTICLE,    

726
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,289
            NOT AN              
            IMPERSONATION.      

727
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,225
SHE WON'T                       
TOW THE LINE.                   

728
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,360
                THEY BOTH WILL. 

729
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,696
    BOYS, GIRLS, GIVE HER       
        MORE SUPPORT.           

730
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,499
        MORE WARMTH NOW...      

731
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,503
    A FAMILY SHE CAN JOIN.      

732
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,147
        SO, CHARLIE?            

733
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:44,914
    SO?                         

734
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,817
I LIED.                         
THAT MAKES US EVEN.             

735
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,020
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT            
MY POLITICS?                    

736
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,957
                THEY MIGHT      
                ALSO BE LIES.   

737
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,358
GODDAMN IT!                     

738
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,193
I BELIEVE IN THINGS.            

739
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,729
I BELIEVE                       
IN ENDING SUFFERING.            

740
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,265
            WHAT HAVE           
            YOU DONE, REALLY?   

741
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,600
            GOTTEN              
            YOURSELF FILMED     

742
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,336
            IN ONE DEMONSTRATION
            OR ANOTHER          

743
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:07,704
            IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE.

744
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:10,173
            YOU MADE            
            THE EVENING NEWS,   

745
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:13,410
            SITTING             
            IN FRONT OF A BUS,  

746
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,779
            READING ALOUD       
            FROM CHE GUEVARA.   

747
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:19,015
            WHAT HAVE YOU       
            DONE BESIDES TALK?  

748
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,116
            NOT A THING.        

749
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:23,353
            YOU WANTED          
            TO STOP THE KILLING.

00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:03,726
            TWICE A DAY.        

854
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:06,395
            I CAN SHOW YOU      
            THEIR LOVE STORY--  

855
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:07,597

            TO THESSALONIKI,    

856
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,434
            BUT WHAT            
            ABOUT THE CAR       
            AND EXPLOSIVES?     

857
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,638
            WHO HE              
            WAS PLANNING        
            TO CONTACT, WHEN?   

858
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,109
            IT'S A PROBLEM      
            IF WE CAN'T         
            BREAK HIM.          

859
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:24,113
        YOU HAVE A TAPE         
        OF A BEATING?           

860
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,181
    YEAH.                       

861
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,482
        A BAD ONE?              

862
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,351
        WE'LL USE IT TOMORROW.  

863
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:30,953
            GIVE HIM            
        MORE SLEEP TONIGHT.     

864
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,789
        LET HIM FEEL FORGOTTEN. 

865
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:36,159
            YOU PEOPLE          
        NEED PATIENCE, HUH?     

866
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,863
                LISTEN TO ME.   

867
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,231
                I AM MICHEL.    

868
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,367
NO! NO, NOT AGAIN.              

869
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,368
                    CHARLIE.    

870
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,436
I'M TIRED OF MICHEL.            

871
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,338
GIVE HIM A BREAK.               

872
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,374
BE JOSEPH FOR TONIGHT.          

873
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,441
            THERE ISN'T TIME.   

874
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:56,679
            SOON OR LATER       
            YOU'LL BE QUESTIONED
            ABOUT TONIGHT.      

875
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:59,916
OK. ALL RIGHT.                  
SO YOU'RE MICHEL.               

876
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,083
            I'M MICHEL,         

877
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:04,053
            BUT MY ARAB         
            NAME IS SALIM.      

878
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,489
            I'M FROM            
            A SMALL VILLAGE     

879
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,492
            CLOSE TO            
            THE TOWN OF KHALIL, 

880
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,261
            WHICH THE JEWS      
            CALL HEBRON.        

881
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,629
            KHALIL--SAY IT.     

882
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:14,530
    KHALIL.                     

883
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:15,765
YOU'RE                          
BROTHER'S NAME.                 

884
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:19,669
            MY FATHER           
            WAS THE CHIEF       
            OF THE VILLAGE,     

885
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,839
            WHERE OUR FAMILY    
            LIVED FOR CENTURIES.

886
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,774
            MY FATHER           
            ADMIRED THE JEWS.   

887
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,811
            MY BROTHER AHMED    
            REMEMBERED WATERING 
            GRANDFATHER'S HORSE 

888
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,680
            AND HEARING         
            WONDERFUL STORIES   

889
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:33,015
            FROM                
            JEWISH TRAVELERS    
            AND PEDDLERS.       

890
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,619
            IN 1948             
            MY GRANDFATHER      
            SOLD HIS HORSE      

891
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:39,488
            TO BUY RIFLES       
            TO SHOOT ZIONISTS   

892
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,791
            WHEN THEY ATTACKED  
            OUR VILLAGES.       

893
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:44,126
            ZIONISTS SHOT MY    
            GRANDFATHER INSTEAD.

894
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:47,597
            THEY MADE MY FATHER 
            WITNESS HIS DEATH.  

895
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,033
            MY FATHER, WHO      
            BELIEVED IN THEM.   

896
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,802
IS THAT TRUE?                   

897
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:56,939
                 DO YOU KNOW    
                <i> DAL YISSIN?</i>    

898
00:47:57,642 --> 00:47:59,692
        NO.                     

899
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,743
            IN THAT VILLAGE     
            ON APRIL 9th, 1948, 

900
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:04,714
            254 WOMEN, OLD MEN, 
            AND CHILDREN        

901
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,216
            WERE BUTCHERED BY   
            ZIONIST TERRORISTS  

902
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,820
            WHILE THE MEN WORKED
            IN THE FIELDS.      

903
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:13,089
            IN DAYS             
            500,000 PALESTINIANS

904
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,359
            HAD FLED            
            THEIR OWN COUNTRY.  

905
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,561
            BUT                 
            OUR VILLAGE STAYED  

906
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,631
            ON MY FATHER'S      
            COMMAND UNTIL 1967. 

907
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:24,166
            THAT'S WHEN         
            THE ISRAILI TANKS   

908
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,569
            CAME TO FLATTEN     
            OUR HOUSES,         

909
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,305
            MAKING ROOM FOR     
            THEIR SETTLEMENTS.  

910
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:32,775
            SO WE LEARN         
            TO FIGHT ZIONISTS.  

911
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,144
            DO YOU              
            KNOW WHO SAID,      

912
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:38,514
            "I FIGHT,           
            THEREFORE I EXIST?" 

913
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,182
            HE'S                
            A POLISH TERRORIST. 

914
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,652
            KILLED MANY BRITISH 
            AND PALENSTINIANS.  

915
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:47,089
            THIS PROUD WINNER   
            OF THE NOBEL        
            PRIZE FOR PEACE.    

916
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:51,327
            HE'S THE PRIME      
            MINISTER OF MY      
            COUNTRY PALESTINE,  

917
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:55,865
            WHICH THEY STOLE    
            AND NOW CALL ISRAEL.

918
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,878
                I LOVE YOU.     
                SHARE MY CAUSE. 

919
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:12,848
WHO ARE YOU?                    

920
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,451
                DOES IT PLAY?   

921
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,323
YES. IT PLAYS.                  

922
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:32,568

926
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:56,492

            ISRAELI TANKS       
            IN 1967, CHARLIE.

    TAKING HIM ANYWHERE.        

932
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,852
            GET AWAY.

938
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:42,371
COLONEL HERSCH,                 
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:47,076
                    WHAT IS IT?

942
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,681
        THEY NEARLY             
        BEAT HIM TO DEATH.      

943
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,284
                LAST NIGHT      
                WAS AN ACCIDENT.

944
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:57,153

SAVAGELY TORTURED!              

945
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,889

            IS A MURDERER!      

946
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,223
            I'VE NO SYMPATHY.   

947
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,592
YOU WILL BE                     
RESPONSIBLE THEN

IN CASE ONE OF US DIED.         

1221

01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:26,414
            THAT NOBODY HAS HER 
            BUT GOD AND MICHEL.

THEY'LL NEVER                   
ACCEPT CHARLIE.

01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:05,686
            WHAT AM I           
        SUPPOSED TO DO?         

1385
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:08,289
        WHERE'S JOSEPH,         
        FOR GOD'S SAKE?         

1386
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:11,425
        I PUT ON                
        THE RED SCARF.          

1387
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,027
        HE SAID HE'D COME.      

1388
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:18,132
    THEY WANT TO FLY ME         
    TO LEBANON TOMORROW.        

1389
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:20,367
YOU SON OF A BITCH!             

1390
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:22,002
YOU KILLED HIM!                 

1391
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:24,238
                    YES.        

1392
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,473
YOU SAID YOU'D                  
STOP THE KILLING.               

1393
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,242
            IT WAS NECESSARY.   

1394
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:29,343
I ASKED YOU.                    

1395
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:33,213
                I SAID WHAT YOU 
                WANTED TO HEAR. 

1396
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:34,715
TELL ME THE TRUTH.              

1397
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:40,120
I WANT TO KNOW                  
WHAT I MEAN TO YOU!             

1398
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,221
            CHARLIE, COME ON.   

1399
01:22:41,223 --> 01:22:44,158
NO! YOU NEVER                   
REALLY TOUCHED ME.              

1400
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,696
YOU MADE ME FEEL                
LIKE I WAS NOTHING.             

1401
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:00,574
TELL ME                         
ABOUT THESE.                    

1402
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,977
                    THE SCARS?  

1403
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:03,877
    MM-HMM.                     

1404
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:07,214
            BURNS FROM          
            SITTING IN A TANK.  

1405
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,582
    OH.                         

1406
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:09,616
    AND THESE?                  

1407
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:14,088
            BULLET HOLES FROM   
            GETTING OUT OF IT.  

1408
01:23:15,558 --> 01:23:17,624
OH. AND THIS?                   

1409
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,393
                    SINAI.      

1410
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,196
                GOLAN HEIGHTS.  

1411
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,699
                I'M A MAP OF    
                THE MIDDLE EAST.

1412
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:29,503
                I USED TO TAKE  
                PRIDE IN THAT.  

1413
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,505
WHEN DO YOU STOP?               

1414
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,074
WHEN DOES IT END?               

1415
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:36,543
            THE END IS KHALIL.  

1416
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:39,013
WHAT'S HE LIKE?                 

1417
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:40,647
                HE'S VERY GOOD. 

1418
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:41,815
                CLEVER.         

1419
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,083
                HE ALWAYS MOVES.

1420
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:46,387
                HE HAS NOBODY   
                HE RELIES ON.   

1421
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:47,654
                FEW SEE HIM.    

1422
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:49,790
                HE'LL WANT      
                TO SEE YOU      

1423
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:52,059
                BECAUSE         
                OF HIS BROTHER. 

1424
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,128
HOW WILL                        
I KNOW HIM?                     

1425
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:57,431
            WE DON'T HAVE       
            ANY PICTURES OF HIM.

1426
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,067
            JUST HIS SIGNATURE. 

1427
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,301
    SIGNATURE?                  

1428
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:02,569
            A HABIT, REALLY.    

1429
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,905
            EXTRA WIRE          
            OFF THE DETENATOR   

1430
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:06,907
            THAT HE WINDS       
            AROUND ITSELF       

1431
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:09,610
            AND THROWS IN       
            WITH THE BOMB.      

1432
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:12,813
CAN'T YOU GET                   
A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION?         

1433
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:16,083
SOMEBODY MUST                   
HAVE SEEN HIM.                  

1434
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,253
                    CHARLIE.    

1435
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:22,923

1436
01:24:31,634 --> 01:24:33,100
DON'T GO?                       

1437
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,101
            YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. 

1438
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:38,005
            YOU LIFTED THE LID  
            ON THE OPERATION.   

1439
01:24:38,007 --> 01:24:39,973
            WE CAN SEE IN.      

1440
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,142
            YOU CAN STOP NOW.   

1441
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:43,143
WHY NOW?

            UNTIL NOW,          
            WE'VE BEEN NEARBY.  

1443
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:50,017
            WE COULD STEP IN    
            IF YOU NEEDED US.   

1444
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:51,585
            IF YOU GO OVER,     

1445
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:55,422
            YOU'RE OUT OF REACH 
            MAYBE FOR MONTHS.   

1446

            WHEN YOU WANTED.    

1448
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:05,099
HE DIDN'T START ME OUT          
TO HAVE IT END HERE.

1451
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:16,110
I DON'T WANT TO BE
