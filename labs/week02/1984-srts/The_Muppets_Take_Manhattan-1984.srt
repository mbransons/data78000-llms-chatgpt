1
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,773
Together again

2
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:06,378
Gee, it's good to be together again

3
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,097
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone

4
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:16,090
It's not starting over
It's just going on

5
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,093
Together again

6
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,416
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when

7
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:27,980
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling

8
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,379
Together again

9
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,019
Together again

10
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,570
Gee, it's good to be together again

11
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,814
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone

12
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,655
It's not starting over
It's just going on

13
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,579
Together again

14
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,693
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when

15
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:55,578
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling

16
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,410
Together a...

17
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,810
Together a...

18
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,455
Together a...

19
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,815
Together again

20
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,059
Together again

21
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,614
Thank you, thank you!

22
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,379
- They like it.
- They love it!

23
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,375
They're still applauding! Kermie,
you have to go out and take a bow!

24
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,689
Kermit! Kermit! Kermit!

25
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,853
Thank you! Thank you.

26
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,454
Thank you. I really don't know what
to say, except we're really glad...

27
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,539
...you liked Manhattan Melodies.
We all worked hard...

28
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,175
...to make it the best
Senior Variety Show ever.

29
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,538
Hey, Kermit! Next time
we'll see you on Broadway!

30
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,378
Yeah, sure.

31
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,818
That's a great idea!

32
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,575
Let's take Manhattan Melodies
to New York!

33
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:17,300
Broadway is dying to get
a great musical like this.

34
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,054
Broadway?

35
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,900
Thanks, everybody, for having
so much faith in us.

36
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:25,690
It's not often that a frog and a bear
and a pig and a chicken...

37
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:29,333
...and a whatever even get accepted
into college.

38
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:31,777
We're all so proud to be
graduating now.

39
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,819
Some with honours...

40
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:37,737
Woman! Woman! Woman!

41
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,337
Woman!

42
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:46,051
And some with the help
of daily psychological counselling.

43
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,176
Anyway, thank you again.

44
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,372
Thank you for everything, guys.

45
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,773
Broadway?

46
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,820
But this show's not good enough
for Broadway.

47
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:06,577
And the script needs a lot of work.
I still think something's missing.

48
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:12,252
Remember you said we could not
get married until we had enough money?

49
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:16,820
Well, we'd have enough
if we had a hit on Broadway!

50
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,496
- Broadway of what city?
- Gonzo!

51
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,299
What did I say?

52
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,295
Even if the show was good enough,
we're all just graduating.

53
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,179
What about our future plans?

54
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,377
Well, this could be our future!

55
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,216
- That's right!
- And if we don't do it...

56
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,577
...we just say goodbye to each other.

57
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,974
Broadway! Broadway! Broadway!

58
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,015
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go to Broadway!

59
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,579
New York!

60
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,010
Look at everything!

61
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,378
Well, we made it, guys.
We're really here!

62
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:58,940
What a great-looking place!

63
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,530
And it's filled with New Yorkers.
Look at them.

64
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,973
Wowee! Isn't this great?

65
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,176
Well, we better dump our stuff
and find a place to stay.

66
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,771
- Scooter, break out the quarters.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,214
What do you think, guys?

68
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:27,610
How do you like it?

69
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,375
Much better than
that cement mixer I lived in.

70
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,249
I'll trade with anyone
that has a Jacuzzi.

71
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:38,013
Come on, it's just for one day.
We'll all be on Broadway tomorrow.

72
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,534
- We'd like to see Mr. Price.
- Do you have an appointment?

73
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,336
No. But we've got this great show
called Manhattan Melodies...

74
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,418
...that he'll wanna produce
on Broadway.

75
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,970
It's about kids that come
to New York to marry...

76
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:03,173
...and has a wonderful opening number
that goes like this...

77
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,691
Hold it. Hold it.

78
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,211
What's going on out there?

79
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,021
Just a frog with a musical, Mr. Price.

80
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:13,377
A musical? Send him in.

81
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:18,613
Net, I'm talking net.

82
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,977
You gotta be kidding with gross.

83
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:22,610
Nice upholstery.

84
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,580
Hold it a minute.
I'll get back to you.

85
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:30,169
Mr. Price, I'm Kermit, and these are
my friends. We've got a show...

86
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,531
...that you'll wanna produce
on Broadway.

87
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:35,175
It's about kids that come
to New York to marry...

88
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,975
...and it opens with a number
that goes like this...

89
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,619
Look at me, here I am

90
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,774
Frog, frog! No singing, okay?
Just give me the general idea.

91
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:48,132
- It's all about life in the big city.
- In the big city?

92
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:50,809
With cops, shootings, car chases?

93
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:54,974
Well, no. No shooting stuff.
It's more like songs and dances.

94
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:57,372
Songs and dances?

95
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,379
That might be interesting.

96
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,256
Nobody cares about shootings anyway.

97
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,138
Are you thinking big-name stars?

98
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:08,138
Actually, we're gonna be the stars.

99
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,451
That's exactly what I was about
to say. You be the stars.

100
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:13,937
Unknowns.

101
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,257
Songs, dances, shootings.

102
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:19,174
No shootings.

103
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,369
You know what?

104
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,379
I smell something.

105
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:27,731
Why does everyone always blame dogs?

106
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,250
No, no. What I smell is a hit.
A hit!

107
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,780
You mean?

108
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,010
Absolutely.

109
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:36,856
I'd be proud to produce your show.
You're gonna be on Broadway!

110
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,259
Hey, Kermit, we did it!

111
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:45,411
Thanks, Mr. Price.
But I'd like you to read the script.

112
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:47,498
There's still something missing...

113
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:50,414
Don't worry. We fix those things
in the previews.

114
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,812
I've gotta call the papers,
rent a theatre...

115
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,659
...and I need $300 from you.

116
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,460
$300?

117
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,174
Yeah. Apiece.

118
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,979
Apiece?

119
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,290
Today. Yeah.

120
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,576
What?

121
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,700
Fellas, that's standard
Broadway procedure.

122
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,216
You give me money,
we start rehearsals tomorrow.

123
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,618
- But we don't have...
- Kermie, I don't think that's right.

124
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,294
Now I smell something!

125
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,576
There are two police officers outside.
They'd like to speak to you.

126
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:30,577
That's him. That's Murray Plotsky.

127
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,773
I gave him my life savings.

128
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,012
Murray? I thought his name
was Martin.

129
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:37,934
Let's go, Murray.
You've pulled your last con job.

130
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,773
I don't want any trouble.

131
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:45,335
Get back! Get back,
or the chicken gets it!

132
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,651
That's a threat?

133
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,250
- Don't hurt her. Take me!
- Whatever you say!

134
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,176
Get away from that door. Move!

135
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,777
Let go of my nose!

136
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:58,410
Watch it!

137
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,616
You too!

138
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,375
Easy!

139
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,932
Get that chicken off my ear!

140
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,290
Get him off my ear!

141
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:53,332
Bad man! Bad man!

142
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:54,571
Way to go!

143
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,772
Where were you when I needed you?

144
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,017
Animals! You're crazy, all of you!

145
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,536
And I want my money back!

146
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,772
Gonzo, are you okay?

147
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:09,570
I just saw my whole life flash
before my nose.

148
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,171
Camilla!

149
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,175
She's hyperventilating! She needs
mouth-to-beak resuscitation!

150
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:19,572
Kermit, he never wanted our show.
He just wanted our money.

151
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:22,090
Gonzo, is Camilla all right?

152
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,979
Yeah, but I think we're engaged.

153
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,815
Come on, we're gonna get
this show on Broadway!

154
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,177
Come on, yeah! Let's go, guys!

155
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,021
You can't take no for an answer

156
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:47,129
You can't take no for an answer

157
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:50,375
You can't take no for an answer

158
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,656
No, no, no

159
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,729
Whenever there's a dream
Worth a-dreamin'

160
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,655
And you wanna see
That dream come true

161
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:06,213
There'll be plenty people talkin'
Say forget all about it

162
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,338
Say it isn't worth the trouble

163
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,135
All the trouble
That you're goin' through

164
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:12,814
Well, what can you do?

165
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,495
You can't take no for an answer

166
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,689
You can't take no for an answer

167
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,889
You can't take no for an answer

168
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,415
No, no, no

169
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:31,814
What you gonna do
When the times get tough

170
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:34,575
And the world's treating you unkind?

171
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:38,052
You've gotta hang onto
Your optimistic outlook

172
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,731
And keep possession
Of your positive state of mind

173
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,050
You can't take no for an answer

174
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,341
You can't take no for an answer

175
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,495
You can't take no for an answer

176
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,459
No, no, no

177
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,658
No, no, no

178
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,699
No, no, no

179
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,013
No, no, no

180
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:24,170
This is turning out to be
a little tougher than I thought.

181
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:28,209
Kermit, I'm not good at this.
I don't take rejection well.

182
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:32,780
Maybe we'd sell the show with more
special effects, like exploding socks.

183
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:36,610
- Oh, Gonzo. Like, that's a lame idea.
- Oh, yeah?

184
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,421
- Stop yelling at her.
- He wasn't yelling.

185
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,970
- Yes, I was.
- Gonzo, don't make trouble.

186
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,610
Fight! Fight! Fight!

187
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:49,370
- Kermit, should we change the script?
- Yeah, what should we do?

188
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,580
I don't know!

189
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,009
How should I know?

190
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:56,452
Why are you always asking me?
Can't you take care of yourselves?

191
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,733
I don't know what to do next.
We failed, okay?

192
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,377
We tried and we failed.

193
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:05,011
Scooter, how much money
do we have left?

194
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:07,781
Enough for two nights,
unless we find cheaper lockers.

195
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:11,373
Well, we have to eat.

196
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,179
Why start now?

197
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,579
Gangway! Coming through!

198
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,971
Hey, watch it, will you?

199
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,578
Hey, that waiter's a rat.

200
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,774
I'm glad we got no money.
Now I ain't got no appetite.

201
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,414
One cheeseburger platter.
What do you want to drink?

202
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:34,379
A glass of milk.

203
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,529
I would like some meat in here.

204
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,773
Picky, picky!
Hey, Pete! Where's the beef?

205
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,616
It's coming! Got two hands only!

206
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,215
What'll you have?

207
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,816
The number for the Board of Health.

208
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,130
That does it!

209
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,299
Another rat crack, right?
Well, I got feelings too!

210
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,975
Do you think I'm doing
this as a hobby?

211
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,172
You wanna know
what I make around here?

212
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,780
Nothing! Nothing!

213
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,699
I live on tips!

214
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,090
I work hard!

215
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:09,573
I try to get tips to feed
my family and my mother.

216
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,977
It just isn't fair.

217
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:16,970
We understand.
We don't have any money either.

218
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,170
Sorry. Not my table.

219
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,456
What a rat!

220
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,971
I'll get us something to eat.

221
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,417
Is patty coming!
Is cow juice coming!

222
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,379
Rizzo, where's Jenny?

223
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,572
May I see a menu, please?

224
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,896
Is special today: Yankee bean soup...

225
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,574
...with spoon.

226
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,493
Sorry I'm late, Pop.

227
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:41,969
Hi, Fran. How are you?

228
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,570
It went longer than I thought.

229
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:47,375
But you will be so proud of me.
I did great!

230
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:51,972
And it was all essay questions.
No sweat. I know I passed.

231
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:53,978
Oh, Jenny, that's very good.

232
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,978
Is cow juice and patty for lady.

233
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,216
Rizzo, I'm back.

234
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:00,131
It's about time.
I can't handle everybody!

235
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:02,775
You can take the weirdos
at table four.

236
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:05,857
Which one do you think is table four?

237
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:10,339
I wonder if Kermie really meant it.
I mean, about failing.

238
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,180
Those producers looked at us
like we were from outer space.

239
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,776
What?

240
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,979
No, man, go back to sleep.
Nobody's landed.

241
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,774
- We'll take 11 bowls, please.
- Okey-dokey.

242
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,699
But there's just one thing.

243
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:28,411
We've got this great show
that's gonna be a big hit on Broadway.

244
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,177
But right now, we're all broke.

245
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,776
You mean, you don't have
any money at all?

246
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,619
Well, not really. No.

247
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,574
But we'd work it off. We promise.

248
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,772
- Waitress!
- Coming!

249
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:47,572
I tell you what is.

250
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,175
Big city.

251
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:51,777
Live, work, huh?

252
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,536
But, not city open.

253
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,939
Only peoples.

254
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,779
Peoples is peoples.

255
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:00,613
No is buildings.

256
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:02,613
Is tomatoes, huh?

257
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,976
Is peoples...

258
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,213
...is dancing, is music, is potatoes!

259
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:13,015
So peoples is peoples, okay?

260
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,974
Thanks. That helped a lot.

261
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,774
Where you going?

262
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,818
Won't you wait for your soup?

263
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:34,816
- But I told you, we don't have...
- Yeah, I know, but I know my pop.

264
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:38,770
When he started out in this city,
he didn't have anything either.

265
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,178
I bet he's back there getting
soup bowls for everybody.

266
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:44,053
Really? With soup in them?

267
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:48,890
I gotta get back to work. I had a
test today, so I came in late.

268
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,376
Yeah, I heard you passed the test.

269
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:56,616
I hope I passed. It's for acceptance
into a fashion-design college.

270
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,177
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
we just graduated from college.

271
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,414
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:03,650
My name's Jenny.

273
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,419
Hi, I'm Kermit.

274
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:07,532
Hi, Kermit. Nice to meet you.

275
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:08,969
I'm a frog.

276
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:20,293
Listen, all I'm saying is maybe
it's time we went out on our own.

277
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:24,176
You mean, out on our own alone?
Without even each other even?

278
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:27,857
The frog's right.
We do depend on him too much.

279
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,211
He feels too responsible for us.

280
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,816
Man, he'd be better off
if we left town.

281
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:35,251
I can't leave Kermit.
We're still pinned.

282
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,896
I'm sorry I blew up outside.

283
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:45,736
But guess what?
Pete's cooking up some soup for us.

284
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,574
Well, what's wrong?

285
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,574
It's just...

286
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,575
We've had some job offers. Right?

287
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,895
Well, that's great.

288
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,376
Well, these job offers are...

289
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:08,575
...they're kind of out-of-town.
Right?

290
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:13,774
What job did I get?

291
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,739
Piggy, are you going too?

292
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,579
Well, Kermie, I...

293
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,577
We go bye-bye?

294
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:30,578
We'll all write to you
and let you know where we are.

295
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:33,932
Yeah, and Kermit,
we still believe in the show.

296
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,379
Aboard!

297
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:55,096
Saying goodbye
Going away

298
00:19:55,621 --> 00:20:00,536
Seems like goodbye's
Such a hard thing to say

299
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:05,577
Touching a hand
Wondering why

300
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:10,572
It's time for saying goodbye

301
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:16,019
Goodbye, Kermie!

302
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,614
Piggy!

303
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,250
Bye!

304
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,059
Goodbye!

305
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:37,376
Saying goodbye
Why is it sad?

306
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:42,611
Makes us remember
The good times we've had

307
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:47,977
Much more to say
Foolish to try

308
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:52,335
It's time for saying goodbye

309
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:01,216
Don't want to leave
But we both know

310
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:04,977
Sometimes it's better to go

311
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:11,896
Somehow I know
We'll meet again

312
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:17,091
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when

313
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:22,416
You're in my heart
So until then

314
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:27,013
It's time for saying goodbye

315
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:43,416
Somehow I know
We'll meet again

316
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:48,976
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when

317
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:54,216
You're in my heart
So until then

318
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,090
Wanna smile

319
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,457
Wanna cry

320
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,694
Saying goodbye

321
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:11,139
It's time for saying goodbye

322
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:18,937
Look at all those people out there.

323
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,019
Lots of people.

324
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,419
But my friends...

325
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:29,413
...my friends are all gone.

326
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:35,211
Well, I'm gonna get them back.

327
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:38,613
I'm gonna get them back.

328
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:42,735
Because the show's not dead
as long as I believe in it.

329
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:45,250
And I'm gonna sell that show.

330
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,810
And we're all gonna be on Broadway.

331
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:50,413
You hear me, New York?

332
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,259
We're gonna be on Broadway!

333
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:55,220
Because I'm not giving up!

334
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:58,698
I'm still here and I'm staying!
You hear that, New York?

335
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,213
I'm staying here!

336
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,611
The frog is staying!

337
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:12,813
- Hi, Jenny.
- Kermit! Hi!

338
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:15,859
Rizzo, is bagel with schmeer
and hominy grit ready.

339
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:20,020
Excuse me? Do you have some work
I could help you out with?

340
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:23,452
- Rizzo, is ready.
- Part-time, so I can work on my show.

341
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,612
What is that stuff supposed to be?

342
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,210
Is grits. Grits. Hominy grits!

343
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,612
How should I know how many?
Count them yourself!

344
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:32,771
What?

345
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,051
- Listen, Pete.
- Wait, wait. Hey!

346
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,097
What is?

347
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,815
This whole morning like this.
You complain.

348
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,939
You slow. You no take orders.
You lazy rat, you!

349
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,730
Lazy rat? Okay, have it your way.
See if I care.

350
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,018
I don't have to take this abuse.
I quit!

351
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,810
Quit? You no can quit!
Is breakfast crowd!

352
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:56,212
All right, don't beg. I'll stay.
But I need some help.

353
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,412
Okay, this is it. Don't blow it!

354
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:02,409
Pete, meet your new employees.
Say hello to Tatooey.

355
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,853
- Masterson.
- Hello.

356
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:07,820
- Chester.
- Oh, I feel terrible.

357
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:09,574
And Yolanda.

358
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:12,091
What a crazy body!

359
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:16,099
Pete, about that job.
See, I was wondering...

360
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:19,014
Wait, wait, wait! Is no good!

361
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:22,850
Rats want job. Frog want job.
What next? Penguins?

362
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:24,854
You have any jobs available?

363
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,095
Well, excuse us for living!

364
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,059
Everybody's waiting for food.

365
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,819
Listen, I can work nights.

366
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:38,218
Come on, Pete, give these guys
a break, all right?

367
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,937
For gosh sake, I go crazy!

368
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,861
Okay, okay, rats, you go to work.

369
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:46,014
Wait, wait, wait.

370
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:48,536
Listen. I tell you what is.

371
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,131
Is no work, is dancing...

372
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:55,055
...is cheese, is big shoes.

373
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,212
All right, rats, you go to work.

374
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:04,420
So, like, you got a boyfriend,
or what?

375
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:07,459
There's nothing else?
I'll do anything. I'll sweep...

376
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,931
We could always use help
in the kitchen.

377
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:11,614
These dishes need washing.

378
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,813
Oh, thanks, Pete!
That's terrific. Oh, boy!

379
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,977
- Thanks a lot, Jenny.
- Hey, no sweat!

380
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,012
So where are all your friends?

381
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,214
They had to leave.

382
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,129
Even your pig friend?

383
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,258
Yes, but I'm bringing her back.

384
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:31,220
I wrote the show, so when I sell it,
I can bring them back.

385
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,214
I'm staying, and I'm getting
our show on Broadway.

386
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:36,093
I really admire that.

387
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:38,735
I'm gonna do something special too,
you know.

388
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:40,619
I mean, in fashion.

389
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:44,012
You know, maybe your fashion
designing can help me now.

390
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:45,690
What do you mean?

391
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,213
I did some reading about Broadway
producers and investors and agents...

392
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:52,855
...and I know what I have to do
to sell our show.

393
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,899
I can use your help,
because I have a three-part plan.

394
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,019
And the first part is...

395
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:01,014
...if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

396
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:33,218
Hey, sweetheart! I just flew in
from the Coast. I love your hair!

397
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:37,249
I got an appointment with, what's
his name, your top theatre agent.

398
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,935
- Leonard Winesop?
- Yeah, Lennie, right.

399
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,899
What office is he in again?

400
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,569
He's in suite 1024,
but I'll call and see...

401
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:47,659
No, that's okay, sweetheart.
No need for that...

402
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,973
...because Lennie and I go way back.
I'm talking way back.

403
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,615
You're too much. Far out! Right on!

404
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:00,409
Mr. Winesop?

405
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:03,249
A frog?

406
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,219
With an Afro?

407
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,051
Hi, Lennie!
I just flew in from the Coast.

408
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:10,257
I love your office!
Don't change a thing.

409
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,254
My private plane's double-parked,
so I gotta run.

410
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:17,335
I got this boffo, socko script for
Broadway called Manhattan Melodies.

411
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:21,056
It's totally today, yet tremendously
timeless. You get first look-see.

412
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:22,654
Have I ever lied to you?

413
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,450
I hear my beeper. I gotta split.
Have your people call my people.

414
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:28,453
We'll take a meeting, all right?

415
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,454
And remember, boffo, Lennie.
Socko, Lennie. Okay?

416
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:33,498
We'll have lunch. Ciao!

417
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:59,410
Hi, Jenny!

418
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,333
Come here. Have a seat.

419
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:04,414
Were you a hit? They loved it.
How'd the costume work?

420
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:07,454
The costume was great,
but it's hard to tell how it went.

421
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,613
They're probably reading
the script right now.

422
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:24,455
Hey, baby.

423
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,010
Baby!

424
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,413
Where you going, sweetheart?

425
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:30,813
Hello?

426
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,015
I said, hello?

427
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:40,012
For the next part of my plan, I have
to look older. I'll grow a mustache.

428
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,812
You'd look cute with a mustache.

429
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,016
You think so?

430
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:45,893
Piggy said that to me once too.

431
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,012
She's hot. Hot mama!

432
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,695
Hot stuff!

433
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:54,609
Looking good. Purple and pretty.
Pretty and purple.

434
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,492
Sweet thing! Sweet thing!

435
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,657
She must be really talented.

436
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,812
Oh, I think you're talented too.

437
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:03,817
You mean it?

438
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:08,219
Of course. I know you're gonna be
a famous designer someday.

439
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:11,778
Oh, Kermit, thank you for saying that.

440
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:13,812
Come on, baby, don't be rude.

441
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:15,653
Look here, now. Look here.

442
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,820
What was that?

443
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,418
It's just New York.

444
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:45,298
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Wrightson.

445
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:50,859
I would suggest that it is
neither prudent nor wise...

446
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,060
...to be a half-hour late from lunch,
especially on your first day.

447
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,416
Yes, sir.

448
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:58,652
Eileen, sorry I'm late.

449
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:02,379
It's okay. Everything's been
going wrong lately.

450
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:06,411
Get your new French perfume here.
Quelle Différence!

451
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:08,653
Is something wrong? Can we talk?

452
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,574
- I'll be fine. I'll be just bien!
- Sorry.

453
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:15,413
Get your Quelle Différence!
It's French! It's feminine!

454
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,619
It'll help you grab one
of those rotten, stinking men!

455
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:21,210
- Quelle Différence...
- Piggy, please!

456
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:24,612
You were fine this morning.
Did something happen at lunch?

457
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,618
My frog turned on me.

458
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:29,619
Yeah, I had some bad tuna myself.

459
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:31,812
I'm gonna fight for him though.

460
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,291
Eileen, do you think I'm pretty?

461
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,413
Of course you are.
You're more than pretty.

462
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:39,020
Gorgeous?

463
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,619
Don't push it, Pig.

464
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,218
You're more than gorgeous, Piggy.
You're unique.

465
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,818
But you know, you could use
a little rouge.

466
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,014
Have a seat.

467
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:55,051
- What are you doing?
- We'll fix you up.

468
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,735
We'll make you look like a movie star.

469
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:59,653
You need cheekbones.

470
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:03,774
Your face is round, no offense.
I'll give you a complete makeup job.

471
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,017
When you walked in,
I said, "She needs rouge."

472
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:08,650
Turn your face.
Did you ever wear rouge?

473
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:12,018
- Now you're gonna really wear rouge.
- Kermit won't care.

474
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,616
Kermit, schmermit. Look.
You look great!

475
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,056
It brings out your eyes.
Know what you need?

476
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,417
- Eyebrows.
- Pigs don't have eyebrows.

477
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:21,020
This pig is going to.

478
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:23,013
And so is this.

479
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:25,414
I'm giving you big eye...

480
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,856
I think I overdid it.
Take a look.

481
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,012
- You have it too.
- I have them too!

482
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,655
- Do some more.
- I'll give you doe eyes.

483
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:34,857
- What are doe eyes?
- Bambi eyes.

484
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:36,978
- Let me see.
- Doe eyes!

485
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:40,218
- Do some more.
- You need freckles for cutesy.

486
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,055
- Freckles.
- Cutesy, cutesy, cutesy.

487
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:45,019
And I'll be cutesy with you.

488
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:46,650
You got it too.

489
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:49,859
You know what?
Why don't you wear lipstick?

490
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,454
Pucker. Pucker.

491
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:55,134
This is just...
You look fabulous! Look at you.

492
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:58,532
A little more on the cheeks.
And a little more on my cheeks!

493
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,935
Powder puff for you!

494
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,615
And a powder puff for me!

495
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:09,417
Quelle Différence!
The newest perfume...

496
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:11,891
You are fired!

497
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,891
What happened to the rats
you had here?

498
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:23,451
A customer complained.
They no like rats for waiters.

499
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,453
But is okay. I make them cook.

500
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,453
Hey, Pete. Here you go.

501
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:31,813
Two zeros on a trampoline
with a side of Joan of Arcs!

502
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,214
Hey, how's the coffee?

503
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:15,018
The coffee's fine. Come on in!

504
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:33,537
I said...

505
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:50,052
Kermit, when are you gonna start
growing your mustache?

506
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:53,418
I stopped shaving three days ago.
Didn't you notice?

507
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,450
Well...

508
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,811
Well, it's subtle.

509
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,614
I bet we could help it along
with a little makeup.

510
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:08,813
Good, because I'm ready for
the second part of my plan.

511
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,974
Got mail for you.

512
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,613
Must be from the gang.

513
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:18,255
Now, Yolanda, chopping is an art.

514
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,820
You gotta be...

515
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,972
...smooth.

516
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:26,211
Oh, hey, it's from Scooter!

517
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:28,811
"Dear Kermit: How are you?"

518
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:32,457
Have you sold the show yet?
Have you heard from the gang?

519
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:35,056
I'm in Cleveland,
and I have a terrific job.

520
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,651
I'm managing a huge movie house here.

521
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:41,735
Well, maybe not managing, but I do
have a lot of responsibilities.

522
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:44,814
- Here are your glasses. To the left.
- Hurry up, Mom.

523
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,210
Thank you.

524
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,816
And I'm meeting
some interesting people.

525
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:50,813
The popping corn is...

526
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,050
...3- D!

527
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:55,816
The corn is popping in your face,
and it's 3-D!

528
00:35:56,021 --> 00:36:00,014
But, Chef, that's not
how 3-D works. Oh, never mind.

529
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:02,013
Here's your ticket.

530
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:05,133
Thanks. But, sir, your 3-D glasses!

531
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:07,212
Sir, your glasses!

532
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:16,811
Sir, don't you want your 3-D glasses?

533
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,451
Oh, I don't need them.
I've seen this movie 97 times.

534
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:24,455
My name is Lew Zealand.
I'm a boomerang fish-thrower.

535
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:28,740
I throw the fish away,
and they come back to me.

536
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,812
Oh, here's my favourite part.

537
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,216
The fish are coming
from the game room!

538
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:36,572
Oh, no! The killer fish
are attacking!

539
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,614
Go get them, guys!

540
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:54,739
So life is great here in Ohio.

541
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,812
Love, Scooter.

542
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:58,819
Here's one from Fozzie.

543
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,015
"Dear Kermit: Wocka, wocka, wocka!"

544
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,650
But seriously, I'm in Maine.

545
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:07,131
My job didn't turn out
too terrific...

546
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:09,815
...so I decided to hibernate.

547
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,292
Ah, back to nature. I love it
out here in the woods.

548
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,461
It's where a bear should be.

549
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:26,820
How do they do it?

550
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,220
I've been trying to sleep for days.

551
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:35,017
Anybody got some warm milk?

552
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,413
Oh, brother.

553
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,814
Hello.

554
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,656
I didn't know this cave was coed.

555
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:46,459
My name's Beth.

556
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,817
Hi, I'm Fozzie.

557
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,858
I can't sleep either.

558
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,217
Maybe if we snuggle...

559
00:37:57,621 --> 00:37:59,737
Kermit!

560
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,458
Here's one more from Dr. Teeth.

561
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,056
Dear Kermit: How's the man?

562
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:10,259
We got this great gig here
outside of Pittsburgh.

563
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:18,090
I tell you, frog...

564
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:19,855
...the band's wailing...

565
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,694
...the music's cooking.

566
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,654
The crowd here is
also wailing and cooking.

567
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:27,210
Yeah, we're in hip city here.

568
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:40,298
They're all doing pretty well.

569
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,656
Yeah, they are.

570
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,297
But, you know, there are no letters
from Gonzo or Rowlf...

571
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,576
...or Piggy.

572
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,891
Oh, I'm sure they've written.

573
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:51,496
Sometimes it just takes awhile.

574
00:38:51,741 --> 00:38:56,053
Yeah, sure. Piggy's probably busy
with some kind of terrific job.

575
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,850
I guess they're all out there
doing terrific.

576
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,094
If I could sell the show,
everyone could come back...

577
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:07,060
...and we could do it together,
like in the old days.

578
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,058
You'll do it, Kermit.

579
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:11,252
Well, thanks, Jenny.

580
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:21,891
That's been happening a lot lately.

581
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:22,971
I know.

582
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,853
It's New York.

583
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:28,095
I'm ready for the second part
of my plan.

584
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:31,174
I'm gonna need your help,
and the other rats too.

585
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:33,941
I think we could be making
some overtime.

586
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,974
- I need you to draw a picture of me.
- Sure!

587
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:38,654
Okay, what's the scoop?

588
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,659
Have you ever heard
of a whispering campaign?

589
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:03,655
- Good afternoon.
- Kermit the Frog.

590
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,052
My reservation secretary made...

591
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:09,092
...a reservation for me.

592
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:11,770
Gesundheit.

593
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:13,579
This way, please.

594
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,460
Afternoon, all.

595
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,251
Don't get up. Keep eating.

596
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,215
May I take your coat?

597
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,059
No! That is...

598
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:33,895
...no, thank you very much, indeed.

599
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:47,250
That's the closest I wanna be
to a frog.

600
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:49,617
- Okay, guys, do your stuff.
- Right!

601
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,452
Okay, you start.

602
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,932
Say, isn't that
that rich producer over there?

603
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,814
The one who's investing
in Manhattan Melodies?

604
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:13,172
Yes! He's investing
millions of dollars...

605
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,218
...in Manhattan Melodies!

606
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:18,652
What's that all about?
Manhattan Melodies, what's that?

607
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:22,177
Isn't that Kermit the Frog,
the bigtime producer?

608
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:24,296
A producer's here?

609
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,857
A big producer, dear.
There's a big producer over there.

610
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,056
It's the hottest thing coming
to Broadway!

611
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,455
It's the best Broadway show
of the year.

612
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:56,258
Vincent? Vincent?

613
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,457
Did I do something wrong?

614
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:02,096
Vincent...

615
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,854
...a frog?

616
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:07,851
- Gee, that food smells good up there.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

617
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:39,016
But this is all a misunderstanding!

618
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,251
Well, thanks a lot, you guys.

619
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,061
So what's the third part
of your plan?

620
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:04,057
I don't think there's gonna be one.

621
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:08,251
I feel like I'm being a phony,
and I can't take it anymore.

622
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:12,056
I don't know what to do next.

623
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,136
All right!

624
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:23,855
Moping time's over.

625
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,092
How about a little exercise?

626
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:28,452
I knew you wanted to.

627
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:32,054
Oh, dear Lord, not jogging.

628
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:37,459
Wow, it's such a beautiful day!

629
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,660
Give me a break!

630
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:47,093
Come on, let's go this way.

631
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,494
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

632
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:51,697
Good. Exercise does the trick.

633
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,296
Yeah, stretch the old frog legs.

634
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:17,575
My purse!

635
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,099
That does it!

636
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:25,699
Excuse me. May I borrow
those a moment?

637
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,455
Piggy?

638
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,969
You creep!

639
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,170
Get off!

640
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,855
I don't even know how to skate!
You know that?

641
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:00,057
- What's going on?
- She stole my purse!

642
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,861
- What?!
- Good try, fella. Come on!

643
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:06,451
That'll teach you to mess
with a lady! Understand?!

644
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:09,534
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you!

645
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:16,300
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?

646
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:18,489
Sightseeing.

647
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:21,050
But you're supposed to be
out of town.

648
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,450
I do not wish to discuss it
in present company.

649
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,858
That's okay, Kermit.
I'll see you back at Pete's.

650
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:35,461
I'm glad you're not hurt, Miss Piggy.

651
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:40,459
Listen, what's going on?

652
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:43,459
Well, you're certainly looking
different now.

653
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:48,058
No gold chains, no shirt
cut to the navel, no toupee!

654
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:49,899
Quelle différence!

655
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,450
What's with all this French stuff?

656
00:46:53,261 --> 00:46:56,094
By sheer chance,
I happened to learn French...

657
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,650
...and get a job interpreting
at the UN.

658
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:02,772
Can I get my skates back, please?

659
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,854
Just a second.
How did you know about that toupee?

660
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:09,650
- None of your beeswax!
- Have you been spying on me?

661
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:13,456
I'll unlace them while you fight.
It's no trouble.

662
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:15,299
Have you been spying on me?

663
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:20,456
Maybe spying on vous and that certain
young girl of the opposite gender.

664
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:21,969
You two-timing her?

665
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:24,052
No, it's just Jenny, a friend.

666
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,297
She's trying to help me
sell the show!

667
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,497
He's gotta sell the show.
What show?

668
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:31,972
Well, if she is just a friend,
then what about...

669
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:33,859
...the huggies?

670
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,491
You gave Jenny the huggies?

671
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:38,174
You know, maybe, Kermit...

672
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:41,697
...maybe it would've been better
if we had never have met.

673
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,894
Then you and Jenny would not be
tormented by my presence.

674
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:48,460
See what the huggies get you?

675
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,580
Jenny and I hugged because we're
friends. That's what friends do.

676
00:47:52,821 --> 00:47:54,652
Friends do not spy!

677
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:56,459
I forgot about that.

678
00:47:56,661 --> 00:48:00,290
- I spied because I care!
- Well, I care too!

679
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,657
- Why don't you say so?
- I just did!

680
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:04,254
All right!

681
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:08,369
Keep the skates.

682
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,054
Keep the skates.

683
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,651
I never use them anyway.
I just like to run around in shorts.

684
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:21,259
Wait a minute!

685
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:24,259
Come on, Piggy.

686
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:41,861
Look, Waldorf.
It's the frog and the pig.

687
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:44,456
Yeah, it looks like they're in love.

688
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:46,856
Kind of makes you sick, doesn't it?

689
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,495
Hey, lovey-dovey!

690
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:52,259
Hubba-hubba!

691
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:54,897
Kermie, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

692
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,097
And I didn't mean it when I said...

693
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,452
...that it would have been better
if we had never met.

694
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:04,256
In fact, I wish we'd met much sooner.

695
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:11,899
Just imagine.
Wouldn't it have been wonderful...

696
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:14,974
...if we'd known each other
when we were little?

697
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:18,860
Imagine...

698
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:21,532
Little Kermie.

699
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,850
Little Piggy.

700
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,411
No matter what life may bring

701
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:44,371
No matter what I may do

702
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:47,813
Be sure of one special thing

703
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:53,017
I'm gonna always be loving you

704
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:58,016
Gonna be a movie star

705
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:01,334
And I'm gonna learn to drive a car

706
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,095
Gonna be a veterinarian too

707
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:07,378
And I'm gonna always love you

708
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:19,051
Hi, guys!

709
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:20,290
Hi, Fozzie!

710
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:26,858
I'll be the cutest model you ever saw

711
00:50:27,061 --> 00:50:30,098
And then I think
I'll study criminal law

712
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,855
And I'm gonna learn to scuba dive too

713
00:50:33,061 --> 00:50:35,097
And I'm gonna always love you

714
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:48,938
Well, I'm gonna be a singer

715
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:53,134
And I'm gonna learn to fly a plane

716
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,651
I'll be a doctor of diseases
I'll help you with your sneezes

717
00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:00,257
And practice neurosurgery
On your brain

718
00:51:01,181 --> 00:51:03,456
Gonna climb the Matterhorn

719
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:06,852
But only after
All our children are born

720
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:09,495
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too

721
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:12,016
And I'm gonna always love you

722
00:51:23,501 --> 00:51:26,061
She's gonna be a movie star

723
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,054
And she's gonna learn to drive a car

724
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:32,094
She's gonna be a veterinarian too

725
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,769
And I'm gonna always love you

726
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:38,692
Well, she's gonna be a singer

727
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:42,739
And she's gonna learn to fly a plane

728
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:46,377
She'll be a doctor of diseases
And help you with your sneezes

729
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:49,493
And practice neurosurgery
On your brain

730
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:53,056
Gonna climb the Matterhorn

731
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:56,458
But only after
All my children are born

732
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:59,095
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too

733
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:03,937
And I'm gonna always love you

734
00:52:17,341 --> 00:52:19,457
Piggy, I think the ride is over.

735
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,854
- Bye, Jenny. See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

736
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,777
Well, here we are.

737
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:46,060
And it sure is nice that we're all
together like this, isn't it?

738
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:49,290
Miss?

739
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,974
- Is customer!
- Coming!

740
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:55,533
Excuse me! I will get it.
After all, moi am a waitress.

741
00:52:56,861 --> 00:52:58,897
Pete, thanks for giving Piggy a job.

742
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:02,099
Rats cooking, is frog washing,
is pig waitress!

743
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:04,491
Is no coffee shop. Is zoo!

744
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:10,650
Hey, Kermit, come on.

745
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:13,500
What about the show?
What are we gonna do next?

746
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:16,050
Is mailman come with letters for you.

747
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:18,058
That must be more from the gang.

748
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:20,451
I'll have two eggs, dry toast...

749
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,458
Pardonnez-moi, dear.

750
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:29,459
Is something wrong?

751
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:33,211
Do you believe in interspecies dating?

752
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,652
I've gone out with some rats,
if that's what you mean.

753
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:40,771
- It's from Gonzo.
- Great!

754
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:43,854
It goes, "Dear Kermit:
I'm in Michigan."

755
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:46,700
Camilla and I have joined
a travelling aquacade.

756
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:50,377
It's not Broadway, but I have met
some good-looking chickens.

757
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:52,173
We put together a terrific act.

758
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:53,900
Ladies and gentlemen!

759
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:57,378
The incredible Gonzo!

760
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,493
Thank you! Arriba!

761
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:01,015
And, thank you!

762
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,098
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd!

763
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,135
And now, for today's climactic act...

764
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:07,456
...look yonder!

765
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,295
I will first make
a death-defying leap...

766
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,259
...from the loop-de-loop ramp...

767
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:17,091
...spinning and hurtling my body
through the flaming circle of doom...

768
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:21,778
...and landing comfortably
on the imitation-leather easy chair...

769
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:25,457
...while my chickens do
their impression of Tony Bennett...

770
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:28,334
...singing the
"William Tell Overture."

771
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:31,171
Please! I must have silence!

772
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:34,371
Are you ready?

773
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:36,853
Thank you, Margaret!

774
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:38,779
Hit it, girls!

775
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:44,253
Here we go!

776
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:46,099
Oh, wait, I can't see.

777
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,493
I forgot my skis!

778
00:54:52,741 --> 00:54:55,050
Don't sound like Tony Bennett to me.

779
00:54:55,821 --> 00:54:59,780
"So everything's going swimmingly.
Love, Gonzo."

780
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,252
Hey, here's one from Rowlf.

781
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,656
Dear Kermit: How's the Frog?

782
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:08,171
I'm in Delaware, and I found
a terrific job in management.

783
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:12,255
I'm surrounded by friends,
and I love what I'm doing.

784
00:55:18,101 --> 00:55:20,661
I am Mr. Skeffington.
My secretary made...

785
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:24,058
...a reservation for the weekend
in the name of Snookums.

786
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:27,140
Oh, yeah.

787
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:31,452
This is Snookums.

788
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:37,454
Daddy wants his little
Snookie-ookums...

789
00:55:37,661 --> 00:55:41,654
...to be especially good this weekend
while Daddy is gone...

790
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:46,258
...or he'll be very angry.

791
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:48,691
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

792
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:49,771
Him!

793
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,660
- We'll take good care of him.
- Snookums is a him!

794
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:56,174
Snookums gets breakfast
at 8 a.m. Exactly.

795
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:58,935
- Breakfast is quiche.
- Yes, sir.

796
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:01,059
Aren't you gonna write it down?

797
00:56:01,701 --> 00:56:03,214
Photographic memory.

798
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:05,215
Write it down!

799
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:08,580
"Dog gets quiche at 8."

800
00:56:08,781 --> 00:56:09,850
Whatever that is.

801
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,853
Marvin, put him on the desk.

802
00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:14,576
Do you have any toys around here?

803
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:17,460
What kind of toys would you like, sir?

804
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,493
Doggy toys!

805
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:23,895
Rubber balls. Rubber fire hydrants.
Rubber newspapers!

806
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:28,858
Snookums prefers rubber Wall Street
Journal to the rubber Washington Post.

807
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,819
Don't we all?

808
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,090
Write it down.

809
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:34,457
Yeah, rubber Wall Street Journal.

810
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:37,090
Now, while Daddy is gone...

811
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:41,300
...the little lumpy-dum-dums
won't have his Daddy...

812
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:44,260
...to give him washy-scrubby.

813
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:48,340
Very impressive.
You speak Chinese like a native.

814
00:56:49,581 --> 00:56:51,173
Now, shake hands.

815
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:53,457
- Beg your pardon?
- Shake! Shake!

816
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

817
00:56:55,341 --> 00:56:57,855
Good boy! Now sit!

818
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:58,977
Yes, sir.

819
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:01,577
Stay. Stay.

820
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:12,854
That was the most humiliating
experience of my life.

821
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:16,093
Hey, Snookie! Hey, look
at little Snookie-ookums!

822
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:19,492
Snookie-wookums want
his little boney-woney?

823
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:22,536
Little binky-booter!

824
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:24,853
Hey, squishy bottom!

825
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:26,935
Hey, lay off him.

826
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:30,580
Rowlf, come on, let us out of here.

827
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:34,052
- We wanna go home!
- Yeah, Rowlf, we wanna go home!

828
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,576
Let us out. Let us go home!

829
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,698
Yeah, me too.

830
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:43,973
"Love, from Rowlf."

831
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:46,850
They're all doing terrific,
aren't they?

832
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,661
Here's one more.
"Dear Mr. Kermit the Frog:

833
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,699
I would be interested
in talking with you about...

834
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:55,057
...your musical, Manhattan Melodies.

835
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:58,099
Come to my office
at your earliest convenience.

836
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,980
Sincerely, Bernard Crawford,
Producer."

837
00:58:01,221 --> 00:58:04,258
I've heard of him.
He's a bigtime Broadway producer!

838
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:05,490
Really?

839
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:07,896
Maybe he wants you to sign a contract.

840
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,972
I better get over there right away!

841
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:13,293
Oh, Kermit! Remember,
just act confident...

842
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,691
...like you know the show is
gonna kill 'em!

843
00:58:15,901 --> 00:58:17,937
Right! Thanks, Jenny.

844
00:58:20,461 --> 00:58:21,860
Goodbye, Piggy.

845
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,857
Call us and tell us what happens.

846
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:26,897
Hey, watch it!

847
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,457
Sorry, I have to get a contract
so I can go out and kill 'em!

848
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:42,700
May I help you?

849
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:45,660
I'm looking for Mr. Crawford.

850
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:48,661
Are you Kermit the Frog?

851
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:53,094
I'm Mr. Crawford.

852
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:54,774
Oh, really?

853
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:59,461
The office boy is out getting lunch.

854
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:02,619
You know kids nowadays,
always eating lunch.

855
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:06,855
- Well, you wanna go in your office...
- No! No, actually...

856
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:10,298
Why don't we just have a seat
over there for a minute?

857
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:11,690
Oh, sure.

858
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:14,250
You're very young to be a producer.

859
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:15,974
You noticed that, huh?

860
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,655
I started out when I was very...

861
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:23,300
Can I tell you the truth?

862
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,295
The thing is that I'm not Bernard
Crawford. I'm Ronnie Crawford.

863
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:30,453
I signed my dad's name.
I didn't think you'd come otherwise.

864
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:32,970
But I wanna produce your show
on Broadway!

865
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:35,132
- You do?
- Yeah, I love it!

866
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:36,490
It is so different!

867
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,700
It's perfect for my first production.
My dad and I have this agreement.

868
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:43,171
I'm coming up the stairs,
and I want my lunch.

869
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:44,695
That's my dad.

870
00:59:44,941 --> 00:59:46,056
Ronnie!

871
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:50,251
- Now.
- Dad, I got great news!

872
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:52,652
If you two are in love,
I don't wanna hear.

873
00:59:52,861 --> 00:59:56,570
You promised I could have one chance
to become a Broadway producer...

874
00:59:56,821 --> 01:00:00,655
...and that you'd get the sets,
lights and scenery and everything.

875
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:02,852
I wanna take that chance right now.

876
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:06,895
Kermit has written a wonderful musical
called Manhattan Melodies...

877
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:09,052
...and I wanna produce it.

878
01:00:09,341 --> 01:00:12,060
- When do we hear the great news?
- Dad!

879
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:14,053
All right, all right.

880
01:00:14,261 --> 01:00:18,095
Tell me, Mr. Author, what is this
musical? All dancing, all croaking?

881
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:21,333
It needs a little work,
because something's still missing.

882
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,657
The two leads marry,
and there's this song:

883
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,374
Look at me, here I am...

884
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:26,696
Hold it! Hold it!

885
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:29,250
I'm allergic to amphibians singing.

886
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,260
Who's gonna be starring
in this masterpiece?

887
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:34,372
It's just me and my friends.

888
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:38,011
You know, they're all dogs and bears
and chickens and stuff.

889
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:40,689
I told you, I wanna do
something different.

890
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,455
So put some Jell-O down your pants.

891
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:47,489
Don't you realize it might be
against the law...

892
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:49,936
...having a chicken dancing onstage?

893
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:52,892
You're gonna go back on your promise?

894
01:00:53,141 --> 01:00:56,895
I didn't say anything of the kind.
I'll do everything I said I would.

895
01:00:57,141 --> 01:01:00,099
Just because this is ridiculous
doesn't mean it won't work.

896
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:01,933
All right!

897
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:04,411
- When I started in show...
- Thank you, Dad!

898
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:06,539
Yeah, thanks, Dad!

899
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:08,295
See you later!

900
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,896
I gotta tell the whole gang!

901
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:18,857
- Hello, Pete's.
- Jenny?

902
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:20,490
What happened?

903
01:01:21,101 --> 01:01:24,059
We sold the show!
The producer wants it on Broadway.

904
01:01:24,301 --> 01:01:25,450
- Really!
- What?

905
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:28,778
The producer said he's gonna put
the show on Broadway!

906
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:36,492
Tell Piggy she's gonna be a star!

907
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:39,932
And, Jenny? I'd like you
to do the costumes.

908
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:42,018
Oh! Kermit, thanks!

909
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,059
Now that we'll be on Broadway...

910
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,054
...remember what you promised
about getting married?

911
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,900
Not now. We gotta write the gang
and get them back.

912
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:55,730
I'll be at Pete's in 10 minutes, okay?
We did it!

913
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:57,537
We did it!

914
01:01:58,901 --> 01:02:00,459
Together again

915
01:02:33,221 --> 01:02:36,293
Are you sure that Kermit wasn't
at the bus terminal?

916
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:39,175
No, is no there. Is better wait.

917
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:40,934
Come, sit down.

918
01:02:41,181 --> 01:02:45,174
He said he'd be here in 10 minutes.
He's never been gone like this.

919
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:47,651
Listen. I tell you what is.

920
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:50,698
Peoples is peoples.

921
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,217
Is frog gone? Yes.

922
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:56,460
Is peoples worrying,
is peoples looking...

923
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:57,770
...is no come.

924
01:02:58,021 --> 01:03:01,980
But, is peoples working,
is water boiling...

925
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:03,939
...is come. Yeah.

926
01:03:04,421 --> 01:03:06,571
Peoples is peoples.

927
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:15,730
I'm sure Kermit's all right.

928
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:20,173
Well, I bet he just got
so excited about the show...

929
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,332
...he lost track of time.

930
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,340
No, he's missing. I know it.

931
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:29,932
Aren't you excited?

932
01:03:30,221 --> 01:03:34,578
I mean, just think, you're gonna be
on Broadway in a few months.

933
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:35,970
Two weeks.

934
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,539
The show opens in two weeks.

935
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,009
Hey, place is closed.

936
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:42,530
I'm Ronnie Crawford,
I'm producing Kermit's show.

937
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,371
Well, we're Kermit's friends.

938
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:48,219
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm her father.

939
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:50,173
The show opens in two weeks?

940
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:51,734
Well, my dad said tha...

941
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:54,171
I'm letting my dad help out
with the show.

942
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:57,777
He said that we could have
the sets, props and costumes...

943
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:00,541
...but the show has to open
in two weeks.

944
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:05,693
Did you just say Kermit is missing?

945
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:11,534
The writer and the star of my show
is missing...

946
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:14,209
...and we open in two weeks?

947
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,173
No sweat. We'll find him.

948
01:04:16,421 --> 01:04:20,175
We gotta get his friends here,
those bears and chickens and things.

949
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:23,060
Could you send telegrams
to Kermit's friends?

950
01:04:23,301 --> 01:04:24,734
- Oh, please?
- Okey-dokey.

951
01:04:24,981 --> 01:04:26,494
- Let's go.
- Great! Come on!

952
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,931
Is no sweat. I write good.

953
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:34,138
"Dear bears and chickens and things:

954
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:35,536
Is New York.

955
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:36,657
Is play!

956
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,539
Is time!"

957
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:44,937
Kermit needs me.

958
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:47,179
Beth, Beth! Wake up.

959
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:50,652
Hey, I'm going to New York City
to be on Broadway!

960
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:52,334
I'm up! Is it spring?

961
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,338
All right! I'm up.

962
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:57,613
Hey, guys! We're going to New York!

963
01:04:57,821 --> 01:05:00,335
Hey, girls! We're going to New York!

964
01:05:01,621 --> 01:05:03,532
We're going to New York!

965
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:10,779
New York City! Oh, boy!

966
01:05:24,741 --> 01:05:26,140
Good morning.

967
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:30,578
I see we've had our breakfast,
haven't we?

968
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,974
Hi, doctor.

969
01:05:33,861 --> 01:05:36,819
How's our amnesia patient
this morning?

970
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:41,933
I don't know. I haven't been feeling
like myself lately.

971
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,133
I tell you what. If I may...

972
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:47,532
...I'd like to check your reflexes
once again today.

973
01:05:47,901 --> 01:05:49,732
Just take a second.

974
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:56,934
A little slow and confused.

975
01:05:57,181 --> 01:06:01,094
But that's to be expected, because,
as you know, you have amnesia.

976
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:05,931
I'm gonna check to see that there are
no physical injuries one last time.

977
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:07,529
Tickle?

978
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:11,578
Now this might hurt
just for a minute.

979
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,976
But it'll be over soon.

980
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:20,340
Adequate musculoskeleton response.

981
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:23,938
I want you to take a deep breath.
This will hurt.

982
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:33,179
All right.
No rotator-cuff dislocation.

983
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:35,537
Now let's try the mandible.

984
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:42,330
Peachy.

985
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:44,737
No doubt about it.
You have amnesia.

986
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:49,736
The problem is, you were found with
no identification, and oddly enough...

987
01:06:49,981 --> 01:06:51,334
...wearing no clothing.

988
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:55,580
So I did some research into the
major nudist colonies in the area...

989
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:58,335
...and I think I've come up
with something.

990
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:03,896
You are Mr. Enrico Tortellini
of Passaic, New Jersey.

991
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:09,335
Well, I really don't feel Italian.

992
01:07:10,941 --> 01:07:12,738
It was just a long shot.

993
01:07:13,021 --> 01:07:16,457
Mr. X, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but your case is hopeless.

994
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:19,169
Why don't you make a new life
for yourself.

995
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:23,414
And what we can do for you, is give you
a nice, clean set of clothes...

996
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,134
...and wish you good luck.

997
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,138
Thank you, doc.

998
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:47,410
- So I said, "I don't take
my clothes off for anyone...

999
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:49,930
...even if it is 'artistic."'

1000
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:54,057
Janice, everybody, please!
I'm glad to see you too.

1001
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:58,340
But I've been trying to tell you that
Kermit is gone. He's disappeared!

1002
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:23,937
Excuse me.

1003
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:27,575
I'm looking for
the Gordon Employment Agency.

1004
01:08:27,821 --> 01:08:29,015
One floor down.

1005
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:31,496
Oh, I see. Thank you.

1006
01:08:35,221 --> 01:08:36,336
Wait a minute.

1007
01:08:36,581 --> 01:08:38,572
Hold it. What's your name?

1008
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:42,454
"Fill"!

1009
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:45,132
Phil-up. Philip Phil.

1010
01:08:45,341 --> 01:08:47,138
Philip Phil? Catchy name!

1011
01:08:47,341 --> 01:08:48,979
Phil, I'm Bill and this is Gil.

1012
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:51,132
Phil, I'm Gil and this is Jill.

1013
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:53,775
Phil, I'm Jill.
You know Gil and Bill.

1014
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:55,579
Pleased to meet you.

1015
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:58,574
Step into our office.
We're looking for the opinion...

1016
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:01,420
...of the common, ordinary
frog on the street.

1017
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:03,851
You see, Phil, we're in the ad game.

1018
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:05,580
What do you advertise?

1019
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:07,379
Ocean Breeze Soap.

1020
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,054
I never heard of that.

1021
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:10,370
We know.

1022
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:13,374
The truth is, Phil,
our jobs are on the line.

1023
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,657
- Oh, here, sit down.
- Oh, yes.

1024
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:19,331
We've been working on a new slogan.
Tell us if you like it.

1025
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:23,655
"Ocean Breeze Soap.
For people who don't want to stink."

1026
01:09:25,421 --> 01:09:26,456
What do you think?

1027
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,219
Be frank, Phil.

1028
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:30,574
I don't like it.

1029
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,334
You don't?

1030
01:09:33,421 --> 01:09:37,130
How about, "Ocean Breeze Soap.
Just like taking an ocean cruise...

1031
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:40,293
...only there's no boat,
and you don't go anywhere."

1032
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:43,657
Seems a bit long.

1033
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:47,537
Have you tried something simple like:

1034
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:51,336
"Ocean Breeze Soap
will get you clean."

1035
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:53,137
Wait a minute!

1036
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:54,575
Wait just a second.

1037
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:56,971
You mean just say
what the product does?

1038
01:09:57,221 --> 01:09:59,337
Why, no one's ever tried that!

1039
01:09:59,581 --> 01:10:00,730
Well, it's crazy.

1040
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:02,334
Why, it's nuts!

1041
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,771
- We love it!
- Thank you, Phil!

1042
01:10:05,021 --> 01:10:07,854
If we can ever do something
for you, let us know.

1043
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:10,934
Well, I kind of need a job.

1044
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:14,733
Phil, you've got one right here.

1045
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:17,739
We can always use a frog
with horse sense.

1046
01:10:17,941 --> 01:10:19,738
Yes, welcome aboard, Phil.

1047
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:22,216
You are with us now.

1048
01:10:29,821 --> 01:10:31,937
Waldorf, they finally made it
to Broadway.

1049
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,974
- And I already got tickets.
- Are they good seats?

1050
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:38,736
They sure are. They're for
the next train out of town!

1051
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:42,779
So now the show opens
in just one week.

1052
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:45,535
Publicity's started,
and tickets are selling.

1053
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:48,375
We'll rehearse day and night
to get ready...

1054
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,737
...and we have got to find Kermit!

1055
01:10:50,941 --> 01:10:52,169
Who is this guy?

1056
01:10:52,421 --> 01:10:55,731
He's Ronnie Crawford.
He's producing the show.

1057
01:10:56,021 --> 01:10:56,851
Who's she?

1058
01:10:57,101 --> 01:11:00,252
She's Jenny. She's a friend
of Kermit's and mine.

1059
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:03,652
What are we standing around here for?
We gotta find Kermit!

1060
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:05,175
Let's go!

1061
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:07,292
Go! Go! Go!

1062
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:21,900
Have you seen a frog?

1063
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:29,416
- With our revolutionary new slogan:
"Ocean Breeze will get you..."

1064
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:17,653
- Mr. Mayor! It's an emergency!
- Hold it, everybody!

1065
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:19,852
I'm looking for
a singing, dancing frog.

1066
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:23,337
If he can also balance the budget,
I'll hire him.

1067
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:46,933
Wow. I thought opening night was
supposed to be exciting.

1068
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,335
But not without
our little green buddy.

1069
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,257
Maybe we should just cancel.

1070
01:12:54,501 --> 01:12:56,776
No! It is opening night tonight...

1071
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:59,171
...and the show must go on.

1072
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,889
Kermit would want it that way.

1073
01:13:08,181 --> 01:13:11,378
That was a great presentation
you made this morning, Jill.

1074
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:14,260
- Thanks to Phil's flow chart.
- Thank you, Jill.

1075
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:17,140
Hey, how about a new place
for lunch today?

1076
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:44,173
I'll take the bill, Gil.

1077
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,935
Oh, good. Something from
the grill, Jill?

1078
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:50,332
No. Meat makes me ill, Gil.

1079
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:57,337
We'd better go to the theatre now
and get ready.

1080
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:33,414
Together again

1081
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:56,937
Just a couple of frogs.

1082
01:15:01,101 --> 01:15:02,819
No! It's Kermit!

1083
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:10,659
It's Kermit!

1084
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:14,937
- It's Kermit!
- How you doing?

1085
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:17,332
My, what friendly service.

1086
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,776
Where were you?
We were all so worried.

1087
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:22,170
Where were you?

1088
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:24,776
I believe there must be some mistake.

1089
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:28,696
Phil, since you know the waiters,
why don't you order for us?

1090
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:30,778
Phil? What does he mean, "Phil"?

1091
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:33,979
- Kermit, what's wrong?
- Are you speaking to me?

1092
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:37,372
There's nothing wrong.
And I will have the tuna melt.

1093
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:39,737
Like, you don't know us?

1094
01:15:40,021 --> 01:15:43,934
- Well, I'm afraid not. Should I?
- What do you mean, "should you"?

1095
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:48,134
We have a show to put on.
Your show. And it's opening tonight!

1096
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:51,534
Seeing a show would be a pleasant way
to spend time...

1097
01:15:51,741 --> 01:15:54,175
...but I do have
marketing data to review.

1098
01:15:55,621 --> 01:15:57,532
He really doesn't remember us.

1099
01:15:57,741 --> 01:15:59,777
We have to get him to the theatre.

1100
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:01,579
This is for your own good.

1101
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:03,174
Grab him!

1102
01:16:04,821 --> 01:16:07,335
Where are you taking me?!

1103
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,055
They must not get a lot
of repeat business.

1104
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:31,129
So the grizzly bear
walks out of the room.

1105
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:34,538
The panda bear thinks to himself,
"This is odd."

1106
01:16:34,741 --> 01:16:38,177
And then the phone rings. You know
who it is? The polar bear.

1107
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:40,776
And the polar bear says
to the panda bear...

1108
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:43,376
..."I didn't know it was
a koala bear."

1109
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:46,579
Get it? Koala! Wocka-wocka!

1110
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,575
This is amusing,
but I have to go now.

1111
01:16:49,821 --> 01:16:50,731
No, wait!

1112
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,175
He doesn't remember.

1113
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,377
It's no use.
We've tried for hours.

1114
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:57,260
There's nothing left to do.
We have to go on without him.

1115
01:16:57,461 --> 01:17:01,170
Kermit, please! We need you!
Come back to us!

1116
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:02,177
Look.

1117
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:06,580
Maybe you do know me,
but I really don't remember you.

1118
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:08,732
I wish I did.

1119
01:17:09,781 --> 01:17:11,533
You'd better take your places.

1120
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:23,649
Piggy, what'll we do?

1121
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,174
Look at me. You are not Phil.

1122
01:17:28,421 --> 01:17:30,252
You are Kermit the Frog.

1123
01:17:30,501 --> 01:17:33,573
That's Gonzo. That's Fozzie.
That's Rowlf and Scooter.

1124
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,777
And they're your friends.

1125
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:39,138
You wrote the show for them.
That's Ronnie and Jenny.

1126
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:41,531
And I'm Piggy.
Now listen carefully.

1127
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,380
You are Kermit the Frog...

1128
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,492
...and you love me.

1129
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:48,379
You want to marry me.

1130
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,937
- You want to have children with me.
- With you?

1131
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:54,331
In love with a pig?

1132
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:57,339
Oh, wait till I tell
the guys in marketing.

1133
01:17:57,981 --> 01:18:01,132
Maybe you expect me to go hog-wild?

1134
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:04,539
Maybe, perhaps, you could
bring home the bacon?

1135
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:07,571
Oh, the sounds of love!

1136
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:11,972
Cancel the show!

1137
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:25,339
Where am I, anyway?

1138
01:18:29,221 --> 01:18:30,939
Are you all right?

1139
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:33,336
- What's going on?
- You're going on!

1140
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,736
It's Broadway. You made it!

1141
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:40,860
No, the script isn't ready.
There's still something missing.

1142
01:18:41,101 --> 01:18:44,650
- No, it's terrific.
- We gotta tell everyone Kermit's okay.

1143
01:18:44,941 --> 01:18:46,897
Do you remember the opening number?

1144
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:49,336
You mean...

1145
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:52,733
Look at me

1146
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:55,139
Here I am

1147
01:18:56,621 --> 01:18:58,691
Right where I belong

1148
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:03,619
I see that face comin' back to me

1149
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:06,933
Like an old familiar song

1150
01:19:07,981 --> 01:19:10,893
What better place could anyone be?

1151
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:13,977
'Cause you're here with me

1152
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:17,334
It's all I've been lookin' for
And so much more

1153
01:19:17,581 --> 01:19:19,936
And now I'm here
Now you're here

1154
01:19:20,181 --> 01:19:22,172
Nothing can go wrong 'cause I am

1155
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:25,538
Right where I belong

1156
01:19:26,501 --> 01:19:27,934
Here we go!

1157
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:31,736
Hi, guys! Could our friends watch
the show from backstage?

1158
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,539
Could they? Could they?

1159
01:19:34,221 --> 01:19:35,779
Wait a minute! No!

1160
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,330
They cannot watch
the show from backstage.

1161
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:42,131
That's it! That's what's missing.
That's what we need!

1162
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:45,458
More frogs and dogs and bears
and chickens and whatever!

1163
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:48,129
You won't watch the show,
you'll be in it!

1164
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:49,336
Come on!

1165
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:01,732
Look at us, here we are

1166
01:20:01,981 --> 01:20:03,733
Right where we belong

1167
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:05,932
The curtain's up
And the light's are bright

1168
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:08,900
And they're playing our old song

1169
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:11,535
What better place could anyone be?

1170
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,218
'Cause you're here with me

1171
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:17,538
So everyone, here we go
Let's start the show

1172
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:36,771
Extra! Extra!
Somebody's getting married!

1173
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:38,534
Somebody's getting married?

1174
01:20:38,741 --> 01:20:40,413
Hey, somebody's getting married!

1175
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:43,541
Whoa! Somebody's getting married!

1176
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:45,379
Somebody's getting married?

1177
01:20:47,621 --> 01:20:50,579
Somebody's getting married

1178
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:54,174
Somebody's getting married

1179
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:09,450
Somebody get some flowers
Somebody get a ring

1180
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:13,330
Somebody get a chapel
And a choir to sing

1181
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:17,096
Somebody get an organ to play

1182
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:21,175
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

1183
01:21:25,101 --> 01:21:28,730
Somebody get a preacher
Somebody bake a cake

1184
01:21:28,941 --> 01:21:32,456
Somebody get some shoes and rice
And presents to take

1185
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:36,330
Somebody get a sweet negligee

1186
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:40,375
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

1187
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:44,170
Wedding, wedding
Pig and Froggy wedding

1188
01:21:44,381 --> 01:21:47,976
Somebody get champagne
Somebody rent a room

1189
01:21:48,181 --> 01:21:51,810
Somebody get the lovely bride
And somebody get the...

1190
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:53,500
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody

1191
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:57,377
Somebody get this wedding under way

1192
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:01,296
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

1193
01:22:17,181 --> 01:22:20,537
Somebody's getting married...

1194
01:22:20,741 --> 01:22:22,777
...today

1195
01:22:32,421 --> 01:22:34,139
Are they here yet?
Are they here yet?

1196
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:35,973
Did I miss it? Am I late?

1197
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:37,973
No, they'll be here any minute

1198
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:40,177
Oh, boy, me can hardly wait

1199
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:43,977
Isn't this ex citing?
It's the wedding of the year

1200
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:45,734
Look, can't we start without them?

1201
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:48,535
No, you can't until they're here

1202
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:53,213
They're finally getting married...

1203
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:56,293
...now

1204
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:18,853
He'll make me happy

1205
01:23:19,101 --> 01:23:21,740
Each time I see him

1206
01:23:21,981 --> 01:23:24,654
He'll be the reason

1207
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:27,654
My heart can sing

1208
01:23:27,901 --> 01:23:30,734
He'll stand beside me

1209
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:33,774
And I'll have everything

1210
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:36,933
She'll make me happy

1211
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:39,979
Each time I hold her

1212
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:42,576
And I will follow

1213
01:23:42,781 --> 01:23:45,579
Where my heart may lead

1214
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:50,897
And she'll be all I ever need

1215
01:23:53,421 --> 01:23:57,494
Days go passing into years

1216
01:23:59,421 --> 01:24:04,211
Years go passing day by day

1217
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:07,254
She'll make him happy

1218
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,459
Now and forever

1219
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,334
Until forever

1220
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,930
Their love will grow

1221
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,179
She only knows

1222
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,174
He'll make her happy

1223
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:27,336
That's all she needs to know

1224
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:31,260
They'll be so happy

1225
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:34,174
Now and forever

1226
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:39,336
Until forever, their love will grow

1227
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:43,139
I only know

1228
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:46,691
He'll make me happy

1229
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:50,132
That's all I need...

1230
01:24:50,341 --> 01:24:54,732
...to know

1231
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:07,217
Piggy, I thought Gonzo was
gonna play the minister.

1232
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:18,936
Do you, Piggy, take this frog to be
Your lawful wedded husband?

1233
01:25:19,221 --> 01:25:20,939
Do you?

1234
01:25:24,421 --> 01:25:28,414
I do

1235
01:25:33,621 --> 01:25:37,580
Do you, Froggy, take this pig
To be your lawful wedded wife...

1236
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:39,140
...until you die?

1237
01:25:42,021 --> 01:25:44,694
Well, I...

1238
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:50,093
Well, I...

1239
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:51,734
Do you?

1240
01:26:02,221 --> 01:26:05,611
I do

1241
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:13,776
Then because you share a love so big

1242
01:26:14,221 --> 01:26:16,735
I now pronounce you...

1243
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:21,139
...frog and pig

1244
01:26:33,181 --> 01:26:35,058
They got married!

1245
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:44,976
What better way could anything end?

1246
01:26:45,181 --> 01:26:47,649
Hand in hand with a friend

1247
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:30,210
