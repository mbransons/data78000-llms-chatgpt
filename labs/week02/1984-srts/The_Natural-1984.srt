1
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,548
This is your spot, Roy.
Pay attention to it.

2
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:30,831
Pitch it in.

3
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:53,394
You got a gift, Roy.
But it's not enough.

4
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,786
You gotta develop yourself.

5
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,592
Rely too much on your own gift
and you'll fail.

6
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:03,827
Iris!

7
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,865
Iris!

8
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,064
Gotta go.

9
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,144
Can I see you?

10
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,185
Right now?

11
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:36,869
What is it?

12
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,668
Wait a minute!

13
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:41,793
The Cubs sent for me. It's just
a tryout. I haven't made it.

14
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,390
- You'll make it.
- There's so many guys.

15
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:48,065
Not with your arm.
Wouldn't your daddy be proud?

16
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,233
- I gotta reach for the best in me.
- Promise me you will?

17
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:53,307
I promise. Come on!

18
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,423
- So when do you have to go?
- Tomorrow.

19
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:07,229
Oh, God.

20
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,631
I've never been on a train before.

21
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,666
It makes you feel important.

22
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,545
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Iris.

23
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,193
I love you so much.

24
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,227
I want you to marry me.

25
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,583
I do.

26
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,553
I want to send for you.

27
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,914
It's all right.

28
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,026
Thanks, Whammer.
My kid will treasure this.

29
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,391
Are you sure it ain't
for yourself now?

30
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:32,551
You see this?

31
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:33,745
What's that?

32
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,232
An Olympic athlete was shot
just one day after the slaying...

33
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,750
...of a football star,
Johnny Zirowski.

34
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,345
In each case,
a silver bullet was used.

35
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:45,228
A silver bullet?
That's crazy.

36
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,027
Max Mercy, the sportswriter?

37
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,508
I don't believe I know you.

38
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,911
Sam Simpson.
"Bud" Simpson, remember?

39
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:53,992
I may have heard of you somewhere.

40
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,431
Of course, you know
who this fella is.

41
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:58,665
Whammer.

42
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,308
You look different in street clothes.

43
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,865
It's always nice to meet
a member of the general public.

44
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,912
You boys heading to Chicago too?

45
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,031
That's right.

46
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,584
I've been invited
to see the Cubs myself.

47
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:10,631
Is that so?

48
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:14,111
I bringing my slam-bang
pitching prospect for a look-see.

49
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,584
What's his name?

50
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:16,945
Roy Hobbs.

51
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:18,504
Where'd he play?

52
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,307
Like I said, Max, he's young.

53
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,223
He mowed them down
in that Sabotac Valley game.

54
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,630
You might've heard
of his 8 no-hitters.

55
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,826
There he is. I'll bring him over.

56
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,705
You do that.

57
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,709
This is Roy Hobbs.

58
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,911
Max Mercy, syndicated sportswriter.

59
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,668
I'm pleased to meet you.

60
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,394
And this here's the Whammer.

61
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:46,511
How do you do?

62
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,593
You look different in street clothes.

63
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,308
First Pete and now "Repeat."

64
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,954
Let's play some cards.

65
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,913
Keep up those no-hitters...

66
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,345
...or they'll look for you
at Soda Pop Valley.

67
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:57,830
Sabotac.

68
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,587
Whatever. Hang on to
the water wagon, old-timer.

69
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,704
- Hey, mister...
- Forget about it.

70
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:06,910
What'll it be?

71
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,710
Hearts.

72
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,508
Next stop, lola.

73
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,952
Half-hour water stop in lola.

74
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:18,951
Half-hour water stop!

75
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,629
Mind the time now.
Half-hour only.

76
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,344
Another home run!

77
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,864
Hey, Whammer, that's the way
to hit them!

78
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,350
Come on, Whammer! Hit another one!

79
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,104
Is he the best?

80
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:53,149
Best there ever was. Best there is
now and best there ever will be.

81
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,147
All right, that's it, folks!

82
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:00,586
Come on, Whammer!
You got a good audience out here!

83
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,993
You wanna see some more?

84
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,784
You'll have to come to Chicago,
buy a ticket!

85
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:12,109
You keep that bat, compliments of me.
Nice job! Keep it up!

86
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,828
There he goes, folks!

87
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,503
Whammer! The best baseball player
in the country!

88
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,514
You don't have
enough prizes for him.

89
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,865
He's a natural.
Give me that green doll.

90
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:38,909
Hey, busher!

91
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,905
Pitch one in here.
I'll knock it to the moon.

92
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:43,711
All right, folks.

93
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:56,506
You sure can pick them, Simpson.

94
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,424
I got $10 here says he strikes
Wambold out on 3 pitch balls.

95
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,830
You old boozer,
your brain's full of mush.

96
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:06,384
This shit-kicker couldn't
strike me out with 100 pitches.

97
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,029
Three is all he'll need, Whammer.

98
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,634
I love contests of skill.

99
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,791
Do you, honey? So do I.

100
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,949
What about you there,
Huckleberry? Scared?

101
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,025
Not of you, I'm not.

102
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:21,989
Why don't we go on the other side
of the tracks, so nobody gets hurt.

103
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:25,388
Come on, folks!

104
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,105
56, 57, 58...

105
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,351
...59, 60 feet...

106
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,153
...6 inches, exactly.

107
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,193
Now here are the rules.

108
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,947
There's gonna be three pitches.

109
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:44,707
Any ball over the plate, or if Whammer
swings and misses is a strike, okay?

110
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,832
Anything outside the strike zone...

111
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:49,031
...that means the contest is over...

112
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,827
...and the Whammer wins.

113
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,428
I'll call them.

114
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,586
Why don't you take
some warm-up pitches?

115
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:56,632
- My arm's loose.
- It's your funeral.

116
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,264
Shall we proceed?
The sun's gonna set.

117
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,433
I wish you hadn't bet that money.
You come by it hard.

118
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,314
I wouldn't have made that bet
if I didn't believe in you.

119
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:09,908
So come on. There.

120
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,630
We're gonna show
what Roy Hobbs is all about.

121
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,786
- Batter up.
- Keep your shirt on.

122
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,310
Batter up! Let's go! Play ball!

123
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:24,065
Help you down there, old man?

124
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:27,224
Throw it here, plowboy!
It don't get lighter.

125
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,710
Chuck it down his whammy.
Chuck it down here.

126
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,988
Give him a shave with it!

127
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:40,507
- Strike 1!
- Wait a minute.

128
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,751
You okay, Sam?

129
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,305
It's all right.

130
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:45,824
This damn glove.

131
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,552
How will you call them
from back there?

132
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,631
He looks wild.

133
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,188
Them your knees shaking?

134
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,625
Mind your business, red-nose,
and play ball!

135
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,388
Throw it in here, greenhorn.

136
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:08,029
Do it again, Roy.
Come on, boy, do it again.

137
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,552
- Strike 2!
- He's throwing spitballs!

138
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,993
In a pig's poop. That ball's
as dry as your granddaddy's scalp.

139
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:25,148
You better not be trying any
funny business out there, rum-pot!

140
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,106
Watch your mouth, mister!

141
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,304
Forget it.

142
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:34,033
This one's it, Whammer.
This is it. Don't let me down.

143
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,554
Don't let up.

144
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:38,823
One more, boy.

145
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,706
Come on, Roy. Right by him, baby.
March him out.

146
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,194
Strike 3.

147
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,624
You're out.

148
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,911
Mister, you forgot this!

149
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,031
Wait, mister!

150
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,549
What's your name?

151
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,548
Roy Hobbs!

152
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:20,750
Here!

153
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,628
Thanks!

154
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,588
I'm Harriet Bird.

155
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:45,910
It'll be in 110 papers.

156
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:48,345
I wanna do a little
background on your boy.

157
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,546
Not now. Maybe in the morning.

158
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,427
- Why?
- I'm not feeling well.

159
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,984
Listen, bring that sawbuck
you owe me.

160
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,425
We'll have breakfast on me, okay?

161
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,712
And I can do wonders
for that boy, if you let me.

162
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,384
Rummy.

163
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,666
Everyone thought
he would murder you.

164
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,468
And the way everyone
rallied around you!

165
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,464
They'll be talking about today
for years to come.

166
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:22,551
It was just like watching
Sir Lancelot jousting Sir Turquine.

167
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,315
Or was it Maldamor?
I'm not sure.

168
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,993
Have you ever read Homer?

169
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:31,984
Homer?

170
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:39,269
Well, only homer I know
has four bases in it.

171
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:44,150
Homer lived ages ago
and wrote about heroes and gods.

172
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:48,587
And he would've written about baseball
had he seen you out there today.

173
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,667
You know what? Someday...

174
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,466
...l'll break every record
in the book.

175
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,509
I know I got it in me.

176
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,066
What will you hope to accomplish?

177
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,313
When I walk down the street, people
will say, "There goes Roy Hobbs.

178
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,868
The best there ever was."

179
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:08,791
Is that all?

180
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,625
Well, what else is there?

181
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:16,988
Don't you know?

182
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,311
Isn't there something more?

183
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,913
More glorious?

184
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:26,908
Do you have a girl?

185
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,712
I'm gonna say good night now.

186
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:47,028
Would you come
watch me play sometime?

187
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,624
Roy, you are priceless.

188
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:51,631
Will you?

189
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,548
Of course.

190
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,426
I could throw a ball here
and never hit the end.

191
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,233
That's for sure, kid.

192
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,906
- Is that licorice?
- Never mind. Let's go to the hotel.

193
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,705
- How far is it to the stadium?
- We're going to the hotel first.

194
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:22,753
We gotta get over to the hotel.
I wanna get a drink.

195
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,271
<i>- This is Harriet.</i>
- Excuse me?

196
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,545
<i>Harriet Bird, silly.</i>

197
00:18:57,675 --> 00:18:59,188
The door's open.

198
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,673
How'd you know I was staying here?

199
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,394
What's going on here?

200
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,025
Will you be the best
there ever was in the game?

201
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,025
That's right.

202
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,670
All right, kid. Throw strikes now.
Put something on it, now!

203
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:12,628
He's walking the whole ballpark,
and he's the best pitcher we got.

204
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,467
I should've been a farmer.

205
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:18,272
Since the day I was born,
I should have been a farmer.

206
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,991
I love chickens
and pigs and ducks.

207
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,430
I'm kind of fond
of nanny goats, I am.

208
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,952
Come on, Fowler!
Throw strikes!

209
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,225
Fowler's killing worms, Pop.

210
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:34,313
Hey, Fowler!
Don't you know how I hate...

211
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,107
...losing to the Pirates?

212
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,911
My ma urged me
to get out of this game.

213
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,715
When I was a kid,
she pleaded with me.

214
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,028
And I meant to, you know what I mean?
But she died.

215
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,024
Tough.

216
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,588
Now look at me.

217
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:53,350
I'm wet nurse to a last place,
dead-to-the-neck-up ball club...

218
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,745
...and I'm choking to death!

219
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:07,145
Wouldn't you think
I could get a fresh drink...

220
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,272
...after all the years I spent
in this game?

221
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:13,474
Red, did you talk to my bastard
partner about the drinking fountain?

222
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:15,631
The Judge said he's working on it.

223
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,993
Working on it?

224
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:20,707
Son of a bitch!

225
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:24,549
The day that snake walked
into this ballpark...

226
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:27,628
...one of the darkest
days of my life, Red.

227
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:58,194
What do we got here?
The Salvation Army Band?

228
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:01,110
- Pop Fisher?
- Who wants to know?

229
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,671
I'm Roy Hobbs,
your new right fielder.

230
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,705
My what?

231
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:06,109
It's right here.

232
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,354
- Scotty Carson sent you here?
- That's right.

233
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,148
He must be nuts.

234
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:18,147
Where do they find these guys?

235
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,865
Fella, you don't start playing ball
at your age, you retire.

236
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:25,551
Where'd he find you?

237
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,224
The Heeber Oilers.

238
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,033
I've never heard of them.

239
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:30,424
They're semi-pro.

240
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:33,228
Semi-pro.

241
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:35,113
Schultz, go warm up.

242
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,026
You ever play organized ball
in your life?

243
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,194
I just got back in the game.

244
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,225
What's that mean?

245
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:46,906
I used to play in high school.

246
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:49,628
Excuse me?

247
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:52,067
I used to play in high school.

248
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,664
Red, he used to play in high school.

249
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,394
That's nice.

250
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,752
Scotty Carson signs him up...

251
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:01,384
...the Judge okays it,
they ain't talked to me yet.

252
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,825
I got that in my deal
for as long as I live.

253
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:05,224
They gotta talk to me!

254
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:07,744
- I got a contract.
- I wanna see it.

255
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:12,667
Come on, Hinkle!

256
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,107
$500 they give this guy
to play with us.

257
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,430
This ain't legal.

258
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:22,545
Is Carson your chief scout? He said
he had the authority to sign me.

259
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,274
Yeah, well, he don't have.

260
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:27,066
Let me talk to you just a minute.

261
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,514
He has, Pop.

262
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:35,065
You said so yourself,
if he ever found anybody decent.

263
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,386
I know, but look at this guy.

264
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:40,510
We don't need no middle-aged rookies.

265
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:43,026
Well, we sure need somebody.

266
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:48,384
Hey, fella.

267
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,711
All right, you come at a bad time.

268
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:52,223
Like Red says...

269
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,115
...Scotty Carson seen
something in you.

270
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,951
Go find Doctor Dizzy and suit up.

271
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,952
Red, I should've been a farmer.

272
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,750
Number 11. That's a bad luck number.
I won't go into that.

273
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:12,024
What about 9?

274
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,072
9? Well, you got me.

275
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:17,634
9 it is. What's in the case?

276
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,111
My bat.

277
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,271
A bat?

278
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:22,868
Follow me. Second locker down.

279
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:29,468
Slip this on. See if you got
enough room under the arms.

280
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,905
If it was close,
why didn't you slide?

281
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:39,426
I had a cigar in my back pocket.
I didn't wanna break it.

282
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,067
Hear you and Memo
are getting hitched.

283
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,227
I don't know where you heard that.
She says that to everybody.

284
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,794
It's not true.

285
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,993
What's this, another victim?

286
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:52,223
Bump Bailey.

287
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:57,073
- What are you, a new coach?
- New player. Roy Hobbs.

288
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:58,344
No kidding?

289
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,626
I didn't catch your name.

290
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:05,831
Roy Hobbs.

291
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:07,388
Max Mercy.

292
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,306
Fowler, I wanna ask you something.

293
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:19,626
There'll be a room for you
at the Ellicott Hotel.

294
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,469
Why don't you meet me
in the lobby about 6:30.

295
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:24,785
We'll get something to eat,
have a talk.

296
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:26,030
Fine.

297
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:33,663
Another brilliant find
from our scouting system. Geniuses.

298
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,354
Try this on for size.

299
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:41,827
Welcome to the majors.

300
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,108
We're not moving.

301
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:33,671
- Hey, Pop.
- Hi, honey.

302
00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:36,785
You together?

303
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:39,668
No, I'm meeting Bump.

304
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:45,229
My niece, Memo Paris. Roy Hobbs.

305
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:46,908
He's a new player.

306
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:48,431
How do you do?

307
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:49,870
Hello.

308
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,150
What position?

309
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:54,549
He just started today.

310
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:55,631
Right field.

311
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,112
Right? That's Bump's position,
isn't it, Pop?

312
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:03,627
Mr. Hobbs is brand new, and we're
not sure what we'll do with him.

313
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,025
Come on, I'll walk you to a cab.

314
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:09,750
Bye.

315
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:19,234
Anything wrong?

316
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:22,871
No, I'm just not used to hotels.

317
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:24,184
Let's go.

318
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,231
How long were you with the Oilers?

319
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:42,351
Two weeks.

320
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,869
Two weeks?

321
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:48,744
And before that?

322
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,744
Just knocked around from here to there.

323
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:56,108
You don't mind me asking
these questions, do you?

324
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:00,106
I read Scotty's report on you.

325
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,232
Said you're one hell of a hitter.

326
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:06,228
How come you didn't start playing
when you was younger?

327
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:10,347
I did play when I was younger.

328
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,066
We're already eating.
We got our food.

329
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:14,794
We've already ordered.

330
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,788
But you gave it up?

331
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:19,671
Sort of.

332
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,871
But my mind was always on the game.

333
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,674
So I figured...

334
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,508
...to give it another try.

335
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:29,594
Just like that?

336
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:32,110
Just like that.

337
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:33,714
Where you from?

338
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:36,703
Does it matter?

339
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:41,144
Do you always talk this way
about yourself?

340
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:50,511
Let me tell you something about Pop.

341
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:53,465
He gave his heart and soul
to the game...

342
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:55,906
...only to get it trampled on.

343
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,869
I'd give my right arm
to get him the pennant.

344
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,425
It took me 16 years to get here.

345
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,748
You play me...

346
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,867
...and you'll get the best I got.

347
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,988
I believe you.

348
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:16,754
Pretty good food, huh?

349
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:18,554
It's damn good.

350
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:22,112
You can't spell it,
but it eats pretty good, don't it?

351
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:26,908
All right. A little hustle,
a little hustle!

352
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,145
I don't know where
that water comes from, but...

353
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:33,665
Never mind the water.
Just stand up there and hit the ball.

354
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,108
You wanna sit this one out?

355
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:48,585
Can you imagine that Judge
sending me a middle-aged rookie?

356
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,225
I'm gonna pay his contract.

357
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,908
I ain't gonna play him.

358
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,270
Never.

359
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,433
That's kind of a bad play there.

360
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:33,713
- Which are so
inherently symptomatic...

361
00:30:33,955 --> 00:30:35,104
...of a losing team.

362
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,346
Sorry, doc, I had a little...
You know.

363
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,914
The mind is a strange thing, men.

364
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,631
We must begin by asking it...

365
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,027
..."What is losing?"

366
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:49,030
Losing is a disease...

367
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:52,744
...as contagious as polio.

368
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:02,705
Losing is a disease...

369
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:05,995
...as contagious as syphilis.

370
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,274
Losing is a disease...

371
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:15,110
...as contagious as bubonic plague...

372
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,592
<i>... attacking one...</i>

373
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:19,592
<i>... but infecting all.</i>

374
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,033
But curable.

375
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:31,470
Now, I want you to imagine...

376
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:34,754
...you are on a ship at sea...

377
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,023
...on a vast...

378
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:41,631
You wanna sit down and pay attention?

379
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:43,713
- Gently rocking.

380
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:45,274
Get back in here!

381
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,988
Gently rocking.

382
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:52,189
<i>Gently rocking.</i>

383
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:55,346
<i>Gently rocking.</i>

384
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:11,108
I'm sending you down, Hobbs.

385
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,834
Class B ball.

386
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:16,147
Tomorrow morning, you go
to the Great Lakes Association.

387
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:19,032
- You make the rules.
- That's right.

388
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,505
And you ain't been playing by them.

389
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:23,907
All these other guys play by them.

390
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,027
- You remember signing a contract?
- I remember signing it...

391
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:31,114
...to play ball. Not to be put to sleep
by some hypnotist. I won't do that.

392
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,270
You're going down.

393
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:34,784
Took me a long time to get here.
I won't do it!

394
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:36,709
I can't.

395
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:40,107
I came here to play ball.

396
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,748
Come back here!

397
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:56,952
Batting practice tomorrow.

398
00:32:57,635 --> 00:32:58,784
Be there!

399
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:00,745
I have been...

400
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:02,269
...every day.

401
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,709
You all squared away?

402
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:24,990
- Yeah.
- All right.

403
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,869
Get in the cage.
Let's see what you can do.

404
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,753
Get out of there, Bump.

405
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,346
Show us what you can do.

406
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,907
Try this one, grandpa.

407
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,030
Come here!

408
00:34:48,235 --> 00:34:49,748
Let me see that bat.

409
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,348
Not bad, kid.

410
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:00,225
Where'd you get this?

411
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,870
I made it myself
from a tree near home.

412
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:06,188
"Wonderboy."
You put that on there?

413
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:08,910
What does it mean?

414
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,705
I made it a long time ago,
when I was kid.

415
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,466
I wanted it to be a very special bat.

416
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,192
How about this lightning bolt?

417
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:20,353
The tree I made it from
was split open by lightning.

418
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,111
I don't figure this.

419
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:26,033
All those years, and you never played
organized baseball?

420
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,307
Well, I sort of got sidetracked.

421
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:35,593
Measure that and weigh it.

422
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:39,865
If it comes up to specifications,
we'll let you use it.

423
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:43,150
Now, go on out there
and shag some flies.

424
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,907
Better late than never, Pop.

425
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,672
Red, this is practice.

426
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,348
We'll see.

427
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:56,987
<i>Knights lead Philadelphia, 3-2.</i>
<i>A golden opportunity to break...</i>

428
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:59,629
<i>... a long losing streak.</i>
<i>Fowler winds, throws.</i>

429
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:01,746
<i>Long fly ball.</i>
<i>Bivens moving under.</i>

430
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,111
<i>Here comes Bailey!</i>
<i>Bailey knocks the ball...</i>

431
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:06,192
<i>... and the ball rolls to the wall!</i>

432
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:09,705
<i>One run moving across the plate.</i>
<i>That'll make it 3 to 3.</i>

433
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:11,234
<i>He comes around 3rd base.</i>

434
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,948
<i>Bivens throws the ball to 2nd.</i>

435
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:17,114
<i>Now it's 4-3, the Phillies. A golden</i>
<i>opportunity and it's down the drain...</i>

436
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:20,427
<i>... as Bailey boggles the situation</i>
<i>and knocks the ball...</i>

437
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,387
...loose from Bivens' glove.

438
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:25,388
The Knights can do nothing right,
no matter what they try.

439
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:28,553
You ain't nailed to the ground.
Move. A little hustle!

440
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,589
Let's go, let's go!

441
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:33,508
Bumper, I wanna see you
in my office after the game.

442
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,746
I lost it in the sun.

443
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,229
Blinding.

444
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,388
1 st! 1 st base!

445
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,184
Safe!

446
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,507
All right, all right!

447
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:53,474
Stay put, Bumper.
You're gonna sit this one out.

448
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:56,553
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm taking you out.

449
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:58,387
Do you want an apology from me?

450
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,233
Forget it. I won't apologize.

451
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:02,033
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

452
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:05,506
I'm the manager, you're the player.
You sit down and shut your mouth!

453
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:08,151
- What do you want?
- I want you to sit down!

454
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,432
Gabby, Boone, help him find
his seat! Hobbs, you're up.

455
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:12,988
What's the matter with you?

456
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:15,470
Sit down and shut up,
you mouthy prima donna.

457
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:17,074
You want apologies from me?

458
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:18,071
Sit down!

459
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,674
Trade me and get it over with!

460
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:21,587
Let me have a hitter up here.

461
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:23,507
Come on, Hobbs! You're up!

462
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,427
Knock the cover off the ball.

463
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,466
<i>Now batting for Bump Bailey...</i>

464
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:47,149
<i>... number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

465
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:51,430
<i>Here's a surprise. Fisher will</i>
<i>replace Bump Bailey with number 9.</i>

466
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:53,108
<i>Number 9 is Roy Hobbs.</i>

467
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,473
<i>Hobbs was bought up in midseason.</i>
/ <i>don't know too much about him.</i>

468
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:00,104
<i>Apparently Fisher's very upset</i>
<i>with Bailey.</i>

469
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:02,915
<i>Of course, Bailey messed up</i>
<i>that play with Bivens.</i>

470
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,623
<i>Two runs came in,</i>
<i>that made the Phillies 4 to 3...</i>

471
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,433
<i>... when the Knights led 3-2...</i>

472
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,069
<i>... trying to get out</i>
<i>of this losing streak.</i>

473
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:13,387
<i>MacBride's gonna look in again</i>
<i>at Hobbs right now.</i>

474
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:17,031
<i>He'll check Bivens at 1 st.</i>
<i>Baker leading off of 2nd right now.</i>

475
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:19,112
<i>- Here comes the pitch.</i>
- Strike 1!

476
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:21,711
<i>Fastball, inside corner, strike 1.</i>

477
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:24,952
<i>Hobbs didn't like the call.</i>
<i>Well, welcome to the majors.</i>

478
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:28,904
<i>MacBride gave him a good, strong</i>
<i>fastball on the inside corner.</i>

479
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:21,784
Let me see the ball.

480
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:28,149
- Not that junk, the ball!
- That junk is the ball.

481
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:30,829
- That's a ball?
- Jesus, he shot it to pieces!

482
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:32,906
We want a real ball!

483
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,586
Was that real, the cover coming off?

484
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:54,508
- You were there, you saw it.
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,589
- Explain that cover coming off.
- I hit it as hard as I could.

486
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:00,746
Is it true he just walked in one day?

487
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:02,394
Can we see the bat Hobbs used?

488
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:05,024
That's the way to grease them.
Ain't no mystery.

489
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:07,106
Give us a break!
Where'd you find him?

490
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,789
Scouts found him.
They always look for young players.

491
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:13,914
- He doesn't look young. Is he 35, 36?
- That's young to me.

492
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:16,464
Where in the hell did you find him?

493
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,710
As my chief scout, Mr. Carson,
I'm relying on your honour.

494
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:24,828
<i>Judge,</i> /<i>'m doing what you asked.</i>
<i>Hobbs is a joke, nobody from nowhere.</i>

495
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:27,669
Yes, that's just what
concerns me, Mr. Carson.

496
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:31,385
It's about time we found out
just who he is and where he's from.

497
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,068
Good day.

498
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:47,949
Nice bat.

499
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,310
You like it?

500
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:54,433
Do you think I'll be able to make
one of those bats?

501
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,624
Tell you what.

502
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:00,748
Go down to the lumberyard...

503
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,463
...pick yourself out
a really good piece of wood...

504
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:07,274
...and we'll work on it together.
- All right. Thanks.

505
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,033
- See you.
- See you.

506
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:30,546
I'm Max Mercy. I met you
in the locker room with Bump.

507
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,464
Interesting way you mistreat
a baseball.

508
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:36,470
Can I buy you a beer?

509
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:39,070
- No, I'm in a hurry.
- I wanna ask you something.

510
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:42,386
- Do I look familiar to you?
- You? No.

511
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:44,751
Because you sure look familiar to me.

512
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:47,304
- Where you from, Hobbs?
- Nowhere special.

513
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:50,348
Wait. You ever play
in a Cardinal organization?

514
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:57,987
Well, it'll come to me in a minute.
I got a terrific memory.

515
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:00,554
See you around, Hobbs.

516
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:13,511
Hi, Al.

517
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:15,427
Hi, Iris. How was your weekend?

518
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:16,431
Swell.

519
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:17,824
What can I get you?

520
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,633
One of those, cup of coffee.

521
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:20,870
Help yourself.

522
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:24,710
- AI, did you read Mercy's article?
- Why should I read it? I heard it.

523
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:27,549
Must've been the rain.
Stitches probably got loose.

524
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,229
It didn't start to rain
till after he hit the ball.

525
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:34,434
- The ball was defective.
- Defective. He made a meal out of it.

526
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:37,390
- What's the name of his bat?
- Wonderboy!

527
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:38,704
"Wonderboy."

528
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:43,865
You guys. You know, people are
always running down amazing things.

529
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:47,710
This guy Hobbs, you ain't seen
nothing yet. I got a feeling.

530
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:51,391
Wonderboy. You gotta be kidding!

531
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,904
See you later, Al.

532
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,873
Okay, Ralph.

533
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:10,113

<i>Commissioner Gates made a statement.</i>

536
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,547

537

<i>... and it is within</i>

538
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:24,984

539
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,634

540
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:30,545
<i>"Wonderboy"!</i>
<i>And oh, what a bat it is!</i>

541
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:36,993
My gut tells me this,
and Red agrees.

542
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:40,952
We feel Hobbs can fill
your position very neatly.

543
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,989
We'll give you one more chance
to shape up.

544
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,152
Otherwise, it's the bench.

Looks like your talk to Bump
is paying off.

549
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:02,505
I gotta believe you're right.

550

You've never seen Hobbs before?

582
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,986
No, I already told you that.
What have you got on your mind?

583
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:00,429
Strange.

584
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:06,185
You really threw
that lumber around today.

585
00:46:06,435 --> 00:46:08,471
We broke a few windows, didn't we?

586
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:13,111
Real good. You know, there's not
a mark on it. Not a nick.

587
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:15,271
I boned it so it wouldn't chip.

588
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:17,868
You know what I like?

589
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:20,188
I like this lightning bolt.

590
00:46:20,955 --> 00:46:24,311
When I was a kid, my father gave me
his collection of squadron insignias.

591
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:26,591
The kind flying aces used to wear.

592
00:46:26,835 --> 00:46:28,268
It reminds me of that.

593
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:30,832
- Nice going.
- Nice game, guys.

594
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:33,074
Wanna get something to eat?

595
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:42,427
Hey, Olsen, nice patch.
Try putting it over your eye.

596
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,435
All right, I ain't talking,
I'm hitting.

597
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,752
- Impressive.
- It must be the patch.

598
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:53,951
It's like Samson with his hair.

599
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,424
He came alive.

600
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,830
Well, he sure did.

601
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,993
There seems to be a mistake.
Olsen's hitting the ball.

602
00:47:03,915 --> 00:47:05,746
I want one of those for myself.

603
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:44,510
<i>- Hobbs' homer, goes into the 11 th!</i>

604

Home runs, triples, singles...

605
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:49,067
Anything he wants to hit, he hits.

606
00:48:49,955 --> 00:48:51,593
I've never seen anything like it.

607
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:53,234
It's incredible!

608
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,586
Anything he wants to do, he does!

609
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:59,510
I mean, how can somebody play
that well that came from nowhere?

610
00:49:01,635 --> 00:49:04,513
<i>New York Knights powerhouse hitter,</i>

<i>What's it take to be a big leaguer?</i>

616
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:19,546

617

<i>... so you guys</i>
<i>qualify pretty well.</i>

618
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:24,950
<i>What's your name?</i>

619
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:27,830
<i>And with a few</i>
<i>words of wisdom that...</i>

620
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,827
<i>... who knows, might alter</i>
<i>the destiny...</i>

621
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:32,503
<i>... of one of these fine young fans.</i>

622
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:36,472
Let me tell you something about Pop.
He thinks he's jinxed.

623
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:37,591
What do you mean?

624
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:40,753
Last season he had
some financial problems.

625
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,826
He had to sell the Judge
10% of his shares.

626
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:49,545
That makes the Judge the majority
stockholder of the Knights.

627
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:52,583
But he got one condition
in the contract.

628
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,231
If he can win
the pennant this season...

629
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:57,949
...he can buy the shares back,
and the Judge is out.

630
00:49:59,155 --> 00:50:00,474
If he loses...

631
00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:02,427
...he's out, and he has to sell.

632
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,227
And winner take all.

633
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,068
"If I Had You."

634
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,788
"Small Hotel."

635
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:30,908
"Dear Old Girl."

636
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:47,152
I'd have bet money you
wouldn't know that song!

637
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:52,671
Pitch it in!

638
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,435
Come on, let me see what you got!

639
00:50:56,355 --> 00:50:58,186
Come on, just one more.

640
00:50:58,395 --> 00:50:59,271
Throw him one.

641
00:50:59,995 --> 00:51:01,792
I wanna knock it into the stands!

642
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:03,792
Come on, Roy, pitch it in!

643
00:51:04,355 --> 00:51:07,631
- I bet you 10 bucks he can whiff you.
- You already owe me $10.

644
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,712
- Double or nothing then.
- You're on.

645
00:51:10,795 --> 00:51:11,830
Pitch it here!

646
00:51:12,075 --> 00:51:14,430
One more, Roy! Right into the stands!

647
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,906
Barrel one down his main street!

648
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:45,872
He really burnt that in there.

649
00:51:58,155 --> 00:51:59,383
Come in here a minute.

650
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:02,790
What's up?

651
00:52:03,355 --> 00:52:04,868
Ask the Judge.

652
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:07,910
The Judge?

653
00:52:08,115 --> 00:52:09,514
He wants to see you.

654
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:13,954
I should go with you.

655
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:17,154
No, I can handle it.

656
00:52:21,795 --> 00:52:23,069
I hope so.

657
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:31,667
- I'm Roy Hobbs.
- Yes, the Judge is expecting you.

658
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,064
Go right in.

659
00:52:33,915 --> 00:52:34,904
Thank you.

660
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,427
Come in. Come in.

661
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:49,307
We meet at last.

662
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:53,429
This is a swell office.

663
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:56,146
Mere creature comforts.

664
00:52:56,755 --> 00:52:58,950
Could use a little more light, though.

665
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,274
Where you from, Hobbs?

666
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:09,428
All around, really.
What about you?

667
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:14,989
Please pardon the absence of light.

668
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:19,270
You see, as a youngster I was
frightened of the dark...

669
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:22,865
...and I used to wake up sobbing
in it as if it was water...

670
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,508
...and I was drowning in it.

671
00:53:25,555 --> 00:53:26,954
As you will observe, I have...

672
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:29,669
...disciplined myself
against that fear...

673
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,348
...that now I much prefer...

674
00:53:31,595 --> 00:53:33,267
...a dark room.

675
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:37,667
The only thing I know about the dark
is, you can't see in it.

676
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:40,503
A pure canard.

677
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:41,864
What's a canard?

678
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:44,230
A prevarication.

679
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,351
What's that mean?

680
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,590
A lie.

681
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:49,787
You can see, you know.

682
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,823
Well, not good enough.

683
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:55,466
You see me, don't you?

684
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:57,508
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

685
00:54:05,595 --> 00:54:08,951
I asked you here because I wanted
to pay you my compliments...

686
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:12,232
...for your performance in the field.

687
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:16,064
It's been fun.

688
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:18,869
Oh, you made a great contribution.

689
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:22,468
Stands have been constantly filled.

690
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:27,754
Financial fortunes have been
radically reversed since you joined.

691
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,504
I hadn't noticed.

692
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:32,953
You're not fascinated
by the almighty dollar?

693
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,147
I never gave it much thought.

694
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:40,309
You're above such
mundane thoughts, huh?

695
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:41,869
I didn't say that.

696
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,834
No, I'm as interested in a buck
as anybody else.

697
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:48,704
And I am not one to let
good deeds go unrewarded.

698
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:51,385
Would a new contract interest you?

699
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:55,024
For more money.

700
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,630
You wanna pay me more,
that's up to you.

701
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,388
I don't detect any gratitude
on your part, Mr. Hobbs.

702
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:07,785
I'm under no legal obligation
to pay you one penny more.

703
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:11,466
Either way, I play to win.

704
00:55:11,835 --> 00:55:14,554
A young man your age
ought to think about your future.

705
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:16,872
Well, let me put it to you this way:

706
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,191
There's no way I'm gonna let you
steal this club from Pop.

707
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:25,112
The fact is, Pop is a jinxed man.

708
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,744
All the Roy Hobbses
in the world can't change that.

709
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:31,704
- Well, it'll be a team effort.
- You're a very impudent man.

710
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,787
The interview is ended.

711
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,191
You come back here and turn off
that infernal light!

712
00:55:51,355 --> 00:55:53,152
He's not as greedy as Bump.

713
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:56,469
He'll be hard to work with,
but we'll get him.

714
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,667
How'd it go up there, kiddo?

715
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:12,864
What are you doing here? Stay home
in bed and quit tailing me around.

716
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:16,107
You really are a riddle.
What are you trying to hide?

717
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:19,227
- I ain't hiding a thing.
- Well, who says you are?

718
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:20,504
You know...

719
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:24,594
...old Sam Simpson died before
he could give me the lowdown on you.

720
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:27,350
But I want you to look at this.

721
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:32,111
What you have in your hand is
a great story, but I want it all.

722
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,704
A Max Mercy exclusive.

723
00:56:34,955 --> 00:56:37,185
I don't want the public to get
the wrong idea.

724
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:38,908
Stories are floating around.

725
00:56:39,155 --> 00:56:41,669
One says you played
for another major league team.

726
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,310
One says you were
an acrobat in the circus.

727
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:47,787
There's even a crazy story
that said you killed someone.

728
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:51,431
Let them believe
what they wanna believe.

729
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:55,266
My paper will guarantee you
5 grand, cash, for your story.

730
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:59,464
It'll give your fans something
to keep up their goodwill in you.

731
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:03,704
Once you get to know me better,
you'll like me.

732
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:13,113
Hi, kid. How are you doing?

733
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:14,549
Nice to see you.

734
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:18,707
We're gonna meet a guy
named Gus Sands, all right?

735
00:57:18,955 --> 00:57:19,751
Who's he?

736
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:22,714
You're kidding.
He's a $10 million-a-year bookie.

737
00:57:22,955 --> 00:57:24,832
- You never heard of him?
- No.

738
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,066
Awfully nice guy. Awfully nice.

739
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:30,674
They don't have bands like that
in Nebraska, do they?

740
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,110
That's not where I'm from,
but they aren't there either.

741
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:38,544
Gus?

742
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,350
You know...
Here. You know Roy Hobbs.

743
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:44,745
Yeah, sure.
I know all about Roy Hobbs.

744
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:46,468
Everybody here know everybody?

745
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:48,114
Sit down.

746
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,825
- Have a drink, slugger?
- No, thanks.

747
00:57:52,275 --> 00:57:53,913
Strictly a Wheaties man, right?

748
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:55,634
Well, the eyes.

749
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:58,387
- Gotta keep them clear.
- Oh, yes.

750
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,069
How'd it go today?

751
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:03,426
He did better than we did.
He got 5 out of 5 in the 1 st...

752
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:05,432
...and 3 for 4 in the 2nd.

753
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:07,905
What do you know?
That'll cost me a pretty penny.

754
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:09,185
How's that?

755
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,623
I bet against you today.

756
00:58:11,675 --> 00:58:12,585
Against the Knights?

757
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:14,114
Just against you, kid.

758
00:58:15,675 --> 00:58:17,745
I didn't know you could bet
against one player.

759
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:20,105
You can bet against anybody, anything.

760
00:58:20,515 --> 00:58:22,665
Strikes, balls, hits, runs, errors.

761
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,990
Take your pick.

762
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:28,792
I once bet $100,000
on three pitched balls.

763
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:30,270
How'd you make out?

764
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:32,424
Didn't.

765
00:58:33,835 --> 00:58:36,986
But the next week, I ruined the guy
with a different deal.

766
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,468
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you don't.

767
00:58:40,675 --> 00:58:43,189
I lost with you today...

768
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,955
...but some other time,
I'll clean up double.

769
00:58:46,275 --> 00:58:47,390
How you gonna do that?

770
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:50,033
When you're not batting so good.

771
00:58:50,915 --> 00:58:52,473
How will you know
when that is?

772
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:55,868
The magic eye. It sees all.

773
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:58,387
Show him how it works. Go on.

774
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:00,953
Yeah, sure. Why not?

775
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:06,154
I'll bet that I can tell,
within a buck either way...

776
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:08,865
...how much money
you've got in your pocket.

777
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:12,789
I'll take that chance.

778
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,543
For a thousand dollars?

779
00:59:16,315 --> 00:59:18,704
Better make it a hundred.
You know the Judge.

780
00:59:19,075 --> 00:59:20,747
A hundred it is.

781
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:35,066
You got 10 bucks.

782
00:59:44,795 --> 00:59:45,591
What is it?

783
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:46,870
Eight dollars.

784
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:48,271
You lose.

785
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:50,749
And the silver?

786
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,388
The silver.

787
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:01,472
A dollar, what, 37?

788
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,546
Never misses. Right, sugar?

789
01:00:05,755 --> 01:00:07,871
Just a lucky guy, Gus.

790
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:10,225
That's pretty good. I owe you 100.

791
01:00:10,435 --> 01:00:12,266
Forget it. Forget it.

792
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,989
Someday you'll maybe
do me a favour, eh?

793
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:18,110
Don't bet on it.

794
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,024
Excuse me.

795
01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:30,391
What?

796
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:35,154
I think you overlooked these.

797
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:38,349
We call it even?

798
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:43,384
Would you like to dance?

799
01:00:48,195 --> 01:00:49,674
What do you know about him?

800
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:52,343
Not much. Not very much.

801
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,426
But I got a questionnaire out in
a thousand papers all over the west.

802
01:00:57,675 --> 01:00:59,267
Somebody's gotta claim him, right?

803
01:00:59,475 --> 01:01:00,464
Right.

804
01:01:01,515 --> 01:01:04,348
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, I could be, Max. Could be.

805
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:07,354
I can't pay enough
for good information these days.

806
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:09,988
Thank you.

807
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:13,229
It's nice to know my hair
is full of silver.

808
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,752
Can you read my mind too?

809
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:18,872
No. I'm not good at that.

810
01:01:19,715 --> 01:01:21,706
You don't mind if I just look?

811
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:25,265
Isn't that what you've been doing?

812
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,743
So far.

813
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:30,468
So far it's fun.

814
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:33,946
Does it get better in private?

815
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:39,028
I have a car.

816
01:01:39,995 --> 01:01:41,474
What about Gus?

817
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:45,472
I'll tell him you made me disappear.

818
01:01:57,315 --> 01:01:59,909
My father walked out on us
when I was a little girl.

819
01:02:02,115 --> 01:02:05,073
I don't remember being happy
until I was about 18 or 19.

820
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:06,634
Then what happened?

821
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:09,226
Then I won a beauty contest.

822
01:02:10,035 --> 01:02:11,354
How could you lose?

823
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:15,911
You know, it's strange,
but ever since the hotel, I feel...

824
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,872
...like we've met before.

825
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:22,150
I doubt it.

826
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,070
- So what about you?
- What about me?

827
01:02:28,475 --> 01:02:30,431
Now it's your turn to tell.

828
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:33,073
Me? What's there to tell?

829
01:02:34,515 --> 01:02:36,551
Come on, I don't have any secrets.

830
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,990
Maybe. But I do.

831
01:02:39,915 --> 01:02:41,348
What about magic?

832
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:43,666
Where did you learn magic?

833
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:47,191
I just picked it up around, through
the years, like a lot of things.

834
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:49,944
Like what?

835
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:51,664
Baseball.

836
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,271
"Baseball." Max was right.

837
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:59,309
You're just a mystery.
I mean, I don't know...

838
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:01,593
He's just after a story.

839
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,185
What about Gus?
He's quite a character.

840
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:08,027
Bump introduced us.

841
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:12,671
He picked me up when I was down.

842
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,623
He's a friend.

843
01:03:18,915 --> 01:03:21,588
I'm not waiting for true love
to come along, Roy.

844
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:24,228
I never have.

845
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:28,067
I've known a million guys.

846
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:30,350
Bump was swell.

847
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:32,745
He was real swell, but typical.

848
01:03:34,595 --> 01:03:36,028
You're not like him...

849
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:38,234
...or anyone else.

850
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:43,554
Gus gives me things.

851
01:03:46,595 --> 01:03:48,472
Things I've never had in my life.

852
01:03:51,075 --> 01:03:52,747
Anything wrong with that?

853
01:03:53,835 --> 01:03:55,826
Not if you understand the risks.

854
01:04:00,315 --> 01:04:02,271
There are always risks.

855
01:04:20,435 --> 01:04:21,663
Touch me.

856
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,673
312, please.

857
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,024
Thanks.

858
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:06,823
See you later.

859
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:12,108
You know what time it is?

860
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,674
I could fine you. I would,
if you were making any money.

861
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:17,030
Wait till next year.

862
01:05:17,275 --> 01:05:21,268
There might not be a next year,
you keep pulling stunts like this.

863
01:05:21,475 --> 01:05:23,193
How long you been seeing her anyway?

864
01:05:23,435 --> 01:05:24,754
Since tonight.

865
01:05:25,395 --> 01:05:27,113
I'd better tell you something.

866
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:32,149
You're a grown man. What you do with
your personal time is your business.

867
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:34,904
I got it in the back of my mind,
that girl's bad luck.

868
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,473
- Well, you're a swell uncle.
- Got nothing to do with it.

869
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:39,903
I love her.

870
01:05:40,755 --> 01:05:44,464
But I believe that bad luck has a way
of rubbing itself off on other people.

871
01:05:44,795 --> 01:05:45,944
Don't worry about me.

872
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:47,031
Well, I am.

873
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:48,993
See, I'm just considering you.

874
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,469
I'll consider me.

875
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,463
<i>Strike 3!</i>

876
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:15,264
Where were you?

877
01:06:15,995 --> 01:06:17,474
I was with Gus.

878
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:22,629
He thought something
happened to me last night.

879
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:24,669
It did.

880
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:44,509
Strike 3!

881
01:06:45,195 --> 01:06:46,423
You all right?

882
01:06:46,755 --> 01:06:47,983
We'll get them next time.

883
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:52,186
Haven't you been paying attention?

884
01:06:53,315 --> 01:06:54,111
Strike 3!

885
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:03,589
You miss me?

886
01:07:07,595 --> 01:07:08,994
Strike!

887
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:27,904
What?

888
01:07:29,835 --> 01:07:32,110
Are you...
Are you all right?

889
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:34,394
It's all right.

890
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:35,590
Sorry, I...

891
01:07:35,835 --> 01:07:37,268
It's all right.

892
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:39,754
I just touched you right here.

893
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:41,430
It's okay.

894
01:07:56,315 --> 01:07:59,352
<i>The team bus is now</i>
<i>at the 34th Street entrance.</i>

895
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:01,944
<i>Bus is at the 34th Street entrance.</i>

896
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:04,714
Let's go.

897
01:08:11,075 --> 01:08:13,066
Straighten that good-looking tie.

898
01:08:14,835 --> 01:08:15,711
Bye.

899
01:08:21,915 --> 01:08:23,064
How you doing?

900
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:42,389
<i>Cub programs!</i>

901
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:45,587
<i>Get your Cub program here! 10 cents.</i>

<i>Get your official Cub program here!</i>
<i>10 cents.</i>

903
01:08:54,035 --> 01:08:55,866
Peanuts! 5 cents.

904
01:08:56,675 --> 01:09:00,588
<i>Now batting for New York,</i>
<i>number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

905
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:02,587
<i>Hobbs coming to bat right now.</i>

906
01:09:02,835 --> 01:09:07,351
<i>He has a terrible batting score.</i>
<i>Can't get himself on the track at all.</i>

907
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,584
<i>Hobbs, trying to get</i>
<i>something started.</i>

908
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,706
<i>And here comes the pitch.</i>

909
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:18,793
Strike the bum out!

01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,668
<i>Strike 2!</i>

<i>Hobbs goes down.</i>
<i>3 pitches, 3 strikes.</i>

913
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:26,829
You're a bum!

914
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:30,227
Maybe you should try another bat.

915
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:32,272
Whatever's wrong isn't the bat.

916
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:39,148
<i>Knights lead the Cubs 2-1.</i>

917
01:09:39,395 --> 01:09:41,989
<i>Fowler's stepping up to the bat.</i>
<i>Short ball, a hit!</i>

918
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:46,905
<i>That's gonna be out in the right field.</i>
<i>He'll fire the ball into 3rd base.</i>

919
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,752
<i>Safe at 3rd base!</i>

920

<i>At the end of the 6th,</i>
<i>it's all tied up, 3-3.</i>

921
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:59,794
Cubs leading by 1. Bivens at
the plate. He swings. Fly ball.

922
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,429
<i>Camaretti has problems,</i>
<i>he fumbles the ball!</i>

923

<i>Bivens heads to the 2nd base.</i>

- Where you going?
- You ever hit one that far before?

939
01:12:30,435 --> 01:12:32,027
Hobbs, turn around, will you?

940
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:33,585
What's he looking at?

941
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:35,712
- One more.
- Hobbs, over here.

942
01:12:42,475 --> 01:12:43,954
This is for you.

943
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:46,954
Nice lady.

944
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,144
Are you married?

945
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,306
Hi, folks. What can I get you?

946
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,269
- I'd like you to meet Roy Hobbs.
- Are you kidding?

947
01:13:45,515 --> 01:13:48,791
What do you think I ran here for?
We got jiffy service? My pleasure.

948
01:13:48,995 --> 01:13:50,269
He's a great fan of yours.

949
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:52,466
- What can I get you?
- You got any lemonade?

950
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:53,903
Sure have.

951
01:13:54,155 --> 01:13:57,033
- I'd like the same, please.
- Two lemonades, coming up.

952
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:01,184
No, not married.

953
01:14:02,715 --> 01:14:03,704
Are you?

954
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:05,710
No.

955
01:14:07,835 --> 01:14:11,350
It's unbelievable someone with your
looks would be on the loose so long.

956
01:14:13,275 --> 01:14:14,469
I don't get lonely.

957
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,305
How is it the girls missed you?

958
01:14:22,035 --> 01:14:25,550
I didn't see any point
in settling down.

959
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:29,072
Two lemonades.

960
01:14:29,315 --> 01:14:30,384
Oh, boy.

961
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:32,273
Ain't she a peach?

962
01:14:34,075 --> 01:14:35,633
I come here a lot.

963
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:39,824
You go to many games?

964
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:41,350
No.

965
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:45,269
So why did you come?

966
01:14:46,035 --> 01:14:47,263
Maybe I shouldn't have.

967
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:49,274
I'm glad you did.

968
01:14:49,795 --> 01:14:51,194
Well, I don't know.

969
01:14:51,635 --> 01:14:53,273
We're not kids anymore.

970
01:14:53,475 --> 01:14:55,067
Things are never the same.

971
01:14:57,395 --> 01:14:58,623
Am I different?

972
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,344
Am I?

973
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:05,704
Yeah.

974
01:15:06,595 --> 01:15:07,664
A lot.

975
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:17,108
I thought I saw you once
in a train station here.

976
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:19,784
Really?

977
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:25,424
I used to look for you in crowds...

978
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,908
...thinking someday
maybe you'd be there.

979
01:15:30,995 --> 01:15:32,792
Somewhere I stopped.

980
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:41,187
What happened to you, Roy?

981
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:57,944
My life didn't turn out
the way I expected.

982
01:16:04,915 --> 01:16:05,745
What is it?

983
01:16:05,955 --> 01:16:07,104
I've gotta go.

984
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:08,305
How come?

985
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:10,148
I've just got to.

986
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:16,111
I'd like you to come
to the game tomorrow.

987
01:16:16,555 --> 01:16:17,749
I can't.

988
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:19,151
I came today.

989
01:16:19,595 --> 01:16:20,744
I see. You work?

990
01:16:25,115 --> 01:16:25,911
Come.

991
01:16:47,595 --> 01:16:48,869
Surprise!

992
01:16:49,195 --> 01:16:50,833
It's me, Memo.

993
01:16:51,515 --> 01:16:52,630
Hi.

994
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:53,905
Where are you?

995
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:56,472
I'm here in my room...

996
01:16:56,715 --> 01:17:00,867
...sitting in a white slip,
thinking of you.

997
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:04,110
I miss you.

998
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:05,794
I miss you too.

999
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,588
Did you hear? We won today.

1000
01:17:09,195 --> 01:17:10,674
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.

1001
01:17:14,115 --> 01:17:15,150
Congratulations.

1002
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:17,714
Thanks.

1003
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:20,466
But you better get some rest.

1004
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:22,834
You'll need it.

1005
01:17:23,715 --> 01:17:24,511
Good night.

1006
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:26,230
Good night, Roy.

1007
01:17:32,195 --> 01:17:33,913
And I love you too.

1008
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:38,508
That was cute.

1009
01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:40,747
Smooth enough?

1010
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:46,028
You are in control, aren't you, pal?

1011
01:17:47,595 --> 01:17:49,028
Sure, Gus.

1012
01:17:50,555 --> 01:17:51,465
Sure.

1013
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,703
<i>Hobbs steps up.</i>
<i>He shattered the clock yesterday.</i>

1014
01:17:55,955 --> 01:17:59,345
<i>That's good! Bottom of the 3rd</i>
<i>inning. Hobbs looking in.</i>

1015
01:17:59,595 --> 01:18:03,031
<i>He swings! There's no doubt about</i>
<i>that one! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!</i>

1016
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:05,425
<i>9 to 3. Bottom of the 6th.</i>

1017
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:08,985
<i>He swings! There it goes!</i>
<i>Oh, my!</i>

1018
01:18:09,235 --> 01:18:11,146
<i>9th inning.</i>

1019
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,750
<i>Here's the pitch. He swings!</i>
/ <i>don't believe it!</i>

1020
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:17,624
<i>Four in a row!</i>
<i>What a day for Hobbs!</i>

1021
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:28,473
I just wanted to...

1022
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:30,668
I'm glad you came.

1023
01:18:34,555 --> 01:18:36,352
Just think what I would've missed.

1024
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,074
That was just luck.

1025
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:39,909
I know better.

1026
01:18:42,675 --> 01:18:44,074
Wait. Are you going?

1027
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:46,425
No.

1028
01:18:46,675 --> 01:18:47,744
Can we...

1029
01:18:49,675 --> 01:18:50,949
...walk a bit?

1030
01:18:52,755 --> 01:18:53,710
All right.

1031
01:18:59,275 --> 01:19:01,584
I met a woman on a train to Chicago...

1032
01:19:02,355 --> 01:19:05,028
...and it was a mistake.

1033
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,586
Do you mean when you first left?

1034
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:11,073
That was the beginning
of a lot of mistakes...

1035
01:19:16,355 --> 01:19:18,425
I was in the hospital
for a couple of years.

1036
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:23,187
Finally I got out, and they
told me I couldn't play ball.

1037
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,787
I didn't have any money,
and jobs were hard to come by.

1038
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:31,627
I lost my confidence.

1039
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,911
Then there was just no going back.

1040
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:42,466
How long have you been in Chicago?

1041
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,274
Ten years.

1042
01:19:58,475 --> 01:20:00,670
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

1043
01:20:00,915 --> 01:20:02,428
- Sure?
- I don't wanna put you out.

1044
01:20:02,675 --> 01:20:05,030
It's not putting me out.
I'll just brew it up.

1045
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:06,424
- Nice cup of coffee?
- No.

1046
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:08,347
Something simple, iced tea?

1047
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:09,391
Iced tea.

1048
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:11,313
I don't have any, but I'll brew some.

1049
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:12,829
You have to brew some?

1050
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:15,305
Then I'll have some coffee, okay?

1051
01:20:21,995 --> 01:20:23,667
This is a swell apartment.

1052
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:25,309
Thanks.

1053
01:20:30,995 --> 01:20:32,269
Did you sell the farm?

1054
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:33,785
No.

1055
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:36,073
I'll always have that.

1056
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:38,830
Good.

1057
01:20:40,075 --> 01:20:41,190
It's home.

1058
01:21:15,715 --> 01:21:17,148
It's my son's.

1059
01:21:23,395 --> 01:21:25,431
He means the world to me.

1060
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,267
He's a great kid.

1061
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:35,069
I'll bet he is.

1062
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:41,749
I'd like to meet him.

1063
01:21:42,275 --> 01:21:43,788
He's coming home pretty soon.

1064
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:46,874
Is he with his father?

1065
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:48,864
No.

1066
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:54,545
His father lives in New York.

1067
01:21:57,435 --> 01:21:58,424
Oh, you're...

1068
01:21:58,675 --> 01:22:02,987
But I've been thinking that he needs
his father now. He's at that age.

1069
01:22:03,915 --> 01:22:05,268
I think he needs him.

1070
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:09,951
Sure.

1071
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:13,313
A father makes all the difference.

1072
01:22:49,835 --> 01:22:51,109
You gotta catch your train.

1073
01:22:51,515 --> 01:22:52,391
I can stay.

1074
01:22:52,595 --> 01:22:53,664
You'd better go.

1075
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,191
Where to next?

1076
01:23:07,155 --> 01:23:08,304
Boston.

1077
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:14,549
I'm sorry I missed your boy.

1078
01:23:15,915 --> 01:23:17,143
I'll tell him.

1079
01:23:17,635 --> 01:23:18,863
Roy Hobbs.

1080
01:23:19,475 --> 01:23:20,988
He won't believe it.

1081
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:23,185
That's good!

1082
01:24:23,435 --> 01:24:24,709
Do a goose-step now!

1083
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:27,751
I'm trying to shelter this guy.

1084
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,553
Have a peanut, Bobby.

1085
01:24:30,235 --> 01:24:32,430
No, it's too late.
He's gonna be too old.

1086
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:34,108
Did you do your homework?

1087
01:24:36,515 --> 01:24:37,311
All right!

1088
01:24:37,555 --> 01:24:38,624
Here goes nothing.

1089
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:45,790
I blew a little too hard there.

1090
01:24:51,835 --> 01:24:55,510
Hobbs is making the whole situation
impossible to predict.

1091
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,188
Only more difficult.

1092
01:24:57,395 --> 01:25:01,274
Hobbs will make it more interesting,
but he won't make the difference.

1093
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:15,431
Safe! Safe!

1094
01:25:15,635 --> 01:25:16,545
He dropped the ball!

1095
01:25:22,355 --> 01:25:25,347
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>
<i>Hobbs swings! Long fly ball!</i>

1096
01:25:25,595 --> 01:25:28,234
<i>That's right! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!</i>

1097
01:25:28,475 --> 01:25:31,831
<i>The Knights have tied for the finish!</i>
<i>They've tied for the finish!</i>

1098
01:25:32,155 --> 01:25:35,670
<i>You can hear this crowd! They're</i>
<i>going crazy! They got Hobbs...</i>

1099
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,433
Knock it off!

1100
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:01,953
Hey, knock it off!

1101
01:26:05,675 --> 01:26:07,870
We gotta win another game
before this is over.

1102
01:26:08,115 --> 01:26:10,629
Don't jinx this. Look at this!

1103
01:26:13,115 --> 01:26:14,309
Now, come on.

1104
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,547
Go home, get some sleep.

1105
01:26:16,915 --> 01:26:19,668
Knock off the booze. No booze!

1106
01:26:35,075 --> 01:26:38,306
/<i>'m sorry, there's no answer.</i>
<i>Would you place your call again later?</i>

1107
01:26:38,555 --> 01:26:40,386
Okay, thanks.

1108
01:26:43,275 --> 01:26:45,505
<i>The Knights simply have to win...</i>

1109
01:26:45,715 --> 01:26:50,231
<i>... one game against the Phillies</i>
<i>to put them in the World Series.</i>

1110
01:26:50,475 --> 01:26:53,035
<i>That wraps it up here</i>
<i>for this post-game show.</i>

1111
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:55,391
I'll be right over to pick him up.

1112
01:26:55,635 --> 01:26:58,388
<i>Protect your car</i>
<i>with Valvoline Motor Oil.</i>

<i>This is Jim Bauer inviting you</i>
<i>to join us...</i>

1114
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:16,311
Boy, did I miss you!

1115
01:27:19,795 --> 01:27:21,911
What's going on here?

1116
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:24,193
A victory party.

1117
01:27:24,675 --> 01:27:26,552
We haven't won yet.
Whose place is this?

1118
01:27:26,795 --> 01:27:27,910
Mine.

1119
01:27:28,835 --> 01:27:30,188
At least it will be in a week.

1120
01:27:30,435 --> 01:27:33,666
- You must've hocked your fur for it.
- Never.

1121
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:35,394
Gus chipped in.

1122
01:27:37,155 --> 01:27:38,508
How do you like it?

1123
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:39,984
I like it.

1124
01:27:42,235 --> 01:27:44,032
I'm not so sure anymore...

1125
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,193
...after Chicago.

1126
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:48,266
Come on, Memo, how about a dance?

1127
01:27:48,955 --> 01:27:50,070
Sure, Al.

1128
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,987
Don't wait up, grandpa.

1129
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:04,191
Welcome home, slugger.

1130
01:28:05,475 --> 01:28:06,908
Some blowout, huh?

1131
01:28:07,155 --> 01:28:09,908
All fresh food
from Jack and Charlie's.

1132
01:28:10,155 --> 01:28:11,747
How's the team holding up?

1133
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,144
They can do no wrong.

1134
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:16,307
When you're on a roll,
it's like that sometimes.

1135
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:19,831
When you're not, every little thing
gets you down. What about you?

1136
01:28:20,075 --> 01:28:20,985
What about me?

1137
01:28:21,235 --> 01:28:23,988
I see you dug yourself
out of that hole you were in.

1138
01:28:25,315 --> 01:28:26,748
It must have cost you.

1139
01:28:26,995 --> 01:28:29,145
You're up, you're down.

1140
01:28:29,795 --> 01:28:31,228
How's the Judge treating you?

1141
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:33,471
What's it to you?

1142
01:28:33,835 --> 01:28:34,824
Nothing.

1143
01:28:35,555 --> 01:28:38,786
Except it's a shame that son of a bitch
is paying a player like you...

1144
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:40,344
...rock-bottom salary.

1145
01:28:40,595 --> 01:28:43,553
- I can live with it.
- You gotta look to the future.

1146
01:28:44,395 --> 01:28:47,228
You can't build on what you don't got.

1147
01:28:47,595 --> 01:28:50,428
It's nice to know you worry
so much about a guy like me.

1148
01:28:50,675 --> 01:28:55,112
Listen, I'm just bringing it up
because I know Memo's crazy about you.

1149
01:28:55,355 --> 01:28:59,394
I mean, I wouldn't like to see you
lose her to a better provider.

1150
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:01,387
Fame isn't enough, kid.

1151
01:29:03,475 --> 01:29:04,385
I'll take my chances.

1152
01:29:04,635 --> 01:29:08,594
Why should you, when we can all profit
from these little chats?

1153
01:29:09,355 --> 01:29:11,789
I mean, take tomorrow, for example.

1154
01:29:12,035 --> 01:29:14,026
Tomorrow I wouldn't bet against me.

1155
01:29:14,235 --> 01:29:16,191
You're missing the point, kid.

1156
01:29:16,675 --> 01:29:18,313
I already have.

1157
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:27,792
You can't hang on to the game forever.

1158
01:29:29,315 --> 01:29:31,545
You can't get back into it
from jail either.

1159
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:38,186
Isn't she something?

1160
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:40,153
Yeah, she is.

1161
01:29:40,555 --> 01:29:43,831
What every guy would give
to be in your shoes, huh?

1162
01:29:45,675 --> 01:29:49,588
You're standing close. I can't tell
if it's your toes I'm feeling or mine.

1163
01:30:04,355 --> 01:30:06,346
I misjudged your boy.

1164
01:30:07,995 --> 01:30:10,270
I don't like being disappointed.

1165
01:30:14,355 --> 01:30:15,231
Try these éclairs.

1166
01:30:15,475 --> 01:30:17,670
I was gonna go on this little...

1167
01:30:17,915 --> 01:30:20,509
The whipped cream's a little...
I don't like it.

1168
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:22,108
It's not good for my stomach.

1169
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:24,027
Try one of these.

1170
01:30:24,275 --> 01:30:25,105
Here.

1171
01:30:25,315 --> 01:30:26,589
Try this.

1172
01:30:28,555 --> 01:30:29,670
Thank you.

1173
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:52,149
Having a great time,
take it, everybody!

1174
01:31:17,475 --> 01:31:18,908
You okay?

1175
01:31:19,395 --> 01:31:21,386
Roy, you okay? You okay?

1176
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:22,704
Where's Pop?

1177
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:25,066
"Where's Pop?" What are you, nuts?

1178
01:31:25,275 --> 01:31:26,344
Sit down.

1179
01:31:30,155 --> 01:31:31,952
Get me out of here.

1180
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:33,751
Let's go.

1181
01:31:33,995 --> 01:31:34,871
Call a cab.

1182
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:37,309
Come on, come on.

1183
01:31:55,435 --> 01:31:57,471
And how are we feeling today?

1184
01:32:05,475 --> 01:32:06,544
Where am I?

1185
01:32:06,915 --> 01:32:09,065
Tower Maternity, Roy.

1186
01:32:09,675 --> 01:32:10,949
I'm Dr. Newman.

1187
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:13,663
It was an emergency,
and we were the closest.

1188
01:32:16,835 --> 01:32:19,395
They lost three in a row.

1189
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:22,388
What's done is done.

1190
01:32:23,755 --> 01:32:25,188
Am I okay to play Monday?

1191
01:32:25,715 --> 01:32:27,626
I'm afraid there's some bad news.

1192
01:32:28,355 --> 01:32:31,347
The lining of your stomach
has been gradually deteriorating...

1193
01:32:31,595 --> 01:32:33,028
...due to a previous injury.

1194
01:32:33,475 --> 01:32:36,990
We pumped your stomach
and came up with this.

1195
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:41,869
This silver bullet head has been
in your stomach for some time.

1196
01:32:42,075 --> 01:32:43,394
Years, I would say.

1197
01:32:44,155 --> 01:32:45,588
It doesn't matter.
It's history.

1198
01:32:45,795 --> 01:32:49,151
Yes, but it could prove fatal
if you continue to play baseball.

1199
01:32:49,715 --> 01:32:52,548
Stop now, and in time
it could heal properly.

1200
01:32:53,315 --> 01:32:54,748
Can I play Monday?

1201
01:32:54,955 --> 01:32:57,344
The odds and your age
would be against you.

1202
01:32:58,755 --> 01:33:02,634
One day, your stomach could easily
blow apart, kill you on the spot.

1203
01:33:05,395 --> 01:33:06,623
I'm sorry.

1204
01:33:09,795 --> 01:33:12,184
<i>Roy Hobbs, New York Knights' star,</i>
<i>is laid up...</i>

1205
01:33:12,435 --> 01:33:14,949
<i>... at Tower Maternity Hospital</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

1206
01:33:15,195 --> 01:33:18,392
<i>The full nature and extent</i>
<i>of his illness is as yet undisclosed.</i>

1207
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:21,593
<i>His availability for Monday's</i>
<i>game against Pittsburgh...</i>

1208
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:24,474
<i>... remains a question.</i>
<i>Turning to local news...</i>

1209
01:33:37,715 --> 01:33:38,989
May I come in?

1210
01:33:44,595 --> 01:33:46,426
You must've had a snoot full.

1211
01:33:46,635 --> 01:33:48,353
It was a great party.

1212
01:33:59,035 --> 01:34:02,425
I heard Gus and Max
talking last night.

1213
01:34:03,355 --> 01:34:04,185
What about?

1214
01:34:05,435 --> 01:34:08,472
He said that if you played Monday
it could kill you.

1215
01:34:08,795 --> 01:34:11,070
- It's a lie.
- No, it's not!

1216
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,794
You're not gonna play.

1217
01:34:16,035 --> 01:34:18,071
Really, are you?

1218
01:34:19,155 --> 01:34:20,827
It would just be my last game.

1219
01:34:23,635 --> 01:34:25,432
It's his last game!

1220
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:27,313
Well, that's rich!

1221
01:34:27,555 --> 01:34:29,864
You're trying to kill yourself,
aren't you?

1222
01:34:30,635 --> 01:34:32,512
Doc's making it out
worse than it is.

1223
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:36,313
Oh, he is? Sure he is!

1224
01:34:36,555 --> 01:34:38,830
Hey, why not?

1225
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:42,351
I look swell in black.
Don't you think I look swell in black?

1226
01:34:43,115 --> 01:34:43,945
I sure do.

1227
01:34:45,595 --> 01:34:48,871
Why don't we just get away?
Let's just go away right now.

1228
01:34:49,755 --> 01:34:51,393
I've been away long enough.

1229
01:34:51,835 --> 01:34:53,473
Oh, come on!

1230
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:55,627
Why are you doing this?

1231
01:34:56,155 --> 01:34:57,508
What for?

1232
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,991
Just to play one last game,
is that it?

1233
01:35:00,555 --> 01:35:02,227
It's all I've got left.

1234
01:35:02,915 --> 01:35:04,234
Then I can walk away.

1235
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:07,431
Well, I have a small favour to ask.

1236
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:10,034
Walk away right now...

1237
01:35:11,155 --> 01:35:12,747
...and you'll live for sure.

1238
01:35:13,315 --> 01:35:15,909
That way we can see
a whole lot more of each other.

1239
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:24,110
And you won't walk away empty-handed.

1240
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:26,348
That's for sure.

1241
01:35:28,035 --> 01:35:29,150
What do you mean?

1242
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:33,989
I mean, Gus will stake us
to a lot of money.

1243
01:35:35,675 --> 01:35:38,792
We can buy into a company.
Everybody does that.

1244
01:35:39,915 --> 01:35:44,306
Think what we can do, Roy.
With your name, we'll make out fine.

1245
01:35:45,955 --> 01:35:47,468
If I skip the playoff?

1246
01:35:47,715 --> 01:35:49,990
Come on, Roy, you understand.

1247
01:35:50,435 --> 01:35:52,995
You make up your mind
to have certain things.

1248
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:55,593
You know how it is.

1249
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,194
Yes, I do.

1250
01:36:00,195 --> 01:36:01,469
Do you?

1251
01:36:13,675 --> 01:36:15,506
Just a few practice swings,
that's all.

1252
01:36:15,755 --> 01:36:17,234
Just to get back my timing.

1253
01:36:17,475 --> 01:36:18,874
It's my ass if Pop finds out.

1254
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:21,345
We heard about that.
We heard about it already.

1255
01:36:21,595 --> 01:36:24,348
Just make sure you take it easy.

1256
01:36:24,595 --> 01:36:26,984
Roy's the money.
He gets hurt, we're out of a job!

1257
01:36:27,235 --> 01:36:28,304
We'll take it easy.

1258
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:31,194
Just making a point. Take it easy.

1259
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:34,347
Sometimes I wonder
what I'm doing in this game.

1260
01:36:34,595 --> 01:36:36,631
How do I get myself
in situations like this?

1261
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,435
Diz, I think maybe
we heard that a couple of times.

1262
01:36:39,635 --> 01:36:43,184
He's always saying that. Don't know
about you, but he's making me nuts!

1263
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:47,028
All right, here we go.

1264
01:36:52,315 --> 01:36:53,748
Come on, Diz.

1265
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,547
You get that, Max?

1266
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:06,870
Don't ever look back, Max! Ever!

1267
01:37:14,115 --> 01:37:15,104
Oh, my God!

1268
01:37:17,715 --> 01:37:19,353
Can you stand? Roy?

1269
01:37:20,235 --> 01:37:23,864
- We should've had more sense!
- It's all right. No one will know.

1270
01:37:24,115 --> 01:37:25,707
No one's gonna know.

1271
01:37:25,915 --> 01:37:26,791
Take it easy.

1272
01:37:27,395 --> 01:37:29,351
We better get you
back to the hospital.

1273
01:37:42,915 --> 01:37:43,904
Who's there?

1274
01:37:44,155 --> 01:37:45,827
Don't be alarmed.

1275
01:37:48,115 --> 01:37:50,834
I understand that you are playing.

1276
01:37:52,315 --> 01:37:55,034
- I wouldn't want you to dock my pay.
- On the contrary.

1277
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:58,984
I wish to augment it with a bonus.

1278
01:37:59,835 --> 01:38:03,544
Now, as you may know,
we are favoured to win.

1279
01:38:04,675 --> 01:38:06,711
Which puts you back
working night court.

1280
01:38:06,955 --> 01:38:09,913
I have decided that
would be a grave mistake.

1281
01:38:10,315 --> 01:38:14,433
Now, financially speaking,
I can do better by not winning.

1282
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:16,029
With your help, of course.

1283
01:38:16,395 --> 01:38:18,306
You put that in writing for Pop.

1284
01:38:18,515 --> 01:38:22,588
Now, as you may know, the prevailing
rate for this sort of thing...

1285
01:38:22,835 --> 01:38:24,507
...is $10,000.

1286
01:38:24,755 --> 01:38:26,905
I'm offering you twice that.

1287
01:38:27,435 --> 01:38:29,027
You're wasting your time.

1288
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:32,307
You know as well as I do that
you're in no condition to play.

1289
01:38:33,995 --> 01:38:35,314
Then why the 20,000?

1290
01:38:35,515 --> 01:38:37,073
Insurance.

1291
01:38:38,915 --> 01:38:40,507
You could get into the game.

1292
01:38:40,755 --> 01:38:43,792
You could wreck it
with an unexpected blow.

1293
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:46,989
That'd be the beauty of it.

1294
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:49,624
It's a monumental mistake, Hobbs...

1295
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:54,905
...in light of certain information
that I now possess.

1296
01:38:56,475 --> 01:38:58,306
Police photographs...

1297
01:38:58,995 --> 01:39:02,032
...taken 15 years ago...

1298
01:39:02,675 --> 01:39:04,267
...in a hotel room.

1299
01:39:05,355 --> 01:39:06,788
By the way...

1300
01:39:07,235 --> 01:39:08,554
...that's you.

1301
01:39:09,115 --> 01:39:11,026
A nice young boy.

1302
01:39:11,835 --> 01:39:13,314
Half-naked lady...

1303
01:39:13,515 --> 01:39:14,994
...lying in the street.

1304
01:39:15,235 --> 01:39:18,671
You, in her room, shot.

1305
01:39:19,595 --> 01:39:20,914
Nasty business.

1306
01:39:21,315 --> 01:39:22,111
Mercy.

1307
01:39:22,315 --> 01:39:26,388
Full disclosure of this scandal in the
eyes of your admirers and loved ones...

1308
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:30,753
...could only cause
humiliation. Embarrassment.

1309
01:39:31,915 --> 01:39:33,143
It was suicide.

1310
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:35,585
Oh, Mr. Hobbs...

1311
01:39:36,475 --> 01:39:39,114
...if kids should see this...

1312
01:39:40,715 --> 01:39:43,183
Now, it's a surprisingly
simple procedure.

1313
01:39:43,755 --> 01:39:46,827
You're to play your normal game,
except when you are at bat.

1314
01:39:47,075 --> 01:39:50,750
And then, under no circumstances,
are you to hit the ball safely.

1315
01:39:51,355 --> 01:39:52,834
They'll beat you without me.

1316
01:39:53,035 --> 01:39:55,788
Without you, they lost three in a row.

1317
01:39:56,715 --> 01:40:01,311
What is more, I have a contingency
plan for their flat failure.

1318
01:40:02,715 --> 01:40:04,273
Who else is in on this?

1319
01:40:05,035 --> 01:40:06,309
A key man.

1320
01:40:15,955 --> 01:40:17,866
Good night, Mr. Hobbs.

1321
01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:35,194
Here's another. Listen.

1322
01:40:35,435 --> 01:40:39,348
"We love to watch you hit that ball.
We cheer when you're connecting.

1323
01:40:39,595 --> 01:40:43,713
But it really shocked us, one and all,
to hear that you're expecting."

1324
01:40:44,555 --> 01:40:46,307
Hold it. I didn't write those lines.

1325
01:40:46,555 --> 01:40:48,352
I didn't think you could read.

1326
01:40:50,115 --> 01:40:51,468
The babies. Please!

1327
01:40:51,675 --> 01:40:52,824
What about the babies?

1328
01:40:54,075 --> 01:40:55,827
How would you like to wake up to this?

1329
01:40:56,035 --> 01:40:58,503
I can't have this noise.
You're disturbing the mothers.

1330
01:40:58,715 --> 01:41:00,194
I guess that's you, guys.

1331
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:02,588
Get well quick.

1332
01:41:03,115 --> 01:41:05,549
You just go out there
and play great ball.

1333
01:41:05,755 --> 01:41:06,665
Take care.

1334
01:41:08,635 --> 01:41:10,432
Get well, we need you. Take care.

1335
01:41:10,915 --> 01:41:14,794
Look out on the way out.
Just keep your eyes straight ahead.

1336
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:17,426
It's gonna be tough without you, Roy.

1337
01:41:17,675 --> 01:41:18,949
Thanks, Diz.

1338
01:41:34,395 --> 01:41:35,225
Miss!

1339
01:41:36,195 --> 01:41:39,346
Hi, I'm Max Mercy, sports columnist
for <i>The Daily Mirror.</i>

1340
01:41:39,595 --> 01:41:41,950
I saw your picture in the paper.
Very nice.

1341
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:46,473
Roy and I go back a long way. I wonder
if you'll help me a little on this.

1342
01:41:46,715 --> 01:41:50,833
See, I need a little help
if you could give some.

1343
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:53,595
For Roy's defence, okay?

1344
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,594
Now, you know this woman?
You know what happened?

1345
01:41:58,115 --> 01:42:01,391
Anything to do with a love quarrel?

1346
01:42:01,635 --> 01:42:05,105
You might have known her,
she knew you, a love triangle?

1347
01:42:05,715 --> 01:42:07,353
A bad joke.

1348
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:12,031
I thought you might be able
to help us with some little clue.

1349
01:42:14,035 --> 01:42:17,072
I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep this story from breaking.

1350
01:42:18,795 --> 01:42:19,830
Hey, miss?

1351
01:42:39,915 --> 01:42:41,143
Is there...

1352
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:43,784
...a chair?

1353
01:42:51,115 --> 01:42:53,231
Doc says I have to quit baseball.

1354
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:56,034
Why?

1355
01:43:00,715 --> 01:43:03,434
Some mistakes I guess
we never stop paying for.

1356
01:43:10,115 --> 01:43:11,628
I didn't even know her.

1357
01:43:12,995 --> 01:43:14,144
The girl on the train?

1358
01:43:21,675 --> 01:43:23,108
You liked her, didn't you?

1359
01:43:26,195 --> 01:43:27,150
Yes.

1360
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:32,149
But I didn't see it coming.

1361
01:43:32,995 --> 01:43:36,192
How could you know she'd hurt you?
How could anyone?

1362
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:39,186
- I didn't see it coming.
- You should've?

1363
01:43:39,435 --> 01:43:40,390
Yes.

1364
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:42,634
But I didn't.

1365
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:45,434
Why didn't I?

1366
01:43:47,595 --> 01:43:49,187
You were so young.

1367
01:43:59,235 --> 01:44:00,873
Things sure turned out different.

1368
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:02,511
In what way?

1369
01:44:03,555 --> 01:44:04,704
Different.

1370
01:44:07,595 --> 01:44:11,827
For 16 years, I've lived
with the idea that I could be...

1371
01:44:12,075 --> 01:44:13,554
...the best in the game.

1372
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:16,751
You're so good now!

1373
01:44:16,955 --> 01:44:18,627
I could've been better.

1374
01:44:21,155 --> 01:44:23,191
I could've broke
every record in the book.

1375
01:44:23,755 --> 01:44:25,188
And then?

1376
01:44:26,195 --> 01:44:27,310
"And then?"

1377
01:44:29,395 --> 01:44:32,114
When I walked down the street,
people would've said:

1378
01:44:32,355 --> 01:44:36,268
"There goes Roy Hobbs, the best
there ever was in this game."

1379
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:49,349
You know, I believe we have two lives.

1380
01:44:50,915 --> 01:44:52,268
How? What do you mean?

1381
01:44:53,155 --> 01:44:57,273
The life we learn with and
the life we live with after that.

1382
01:44:59,435 --> 01:45:01,107
With or without the records...

1383
01:45:02,115 --> 01:45:03,707
...they'll remember you.

1384
01:45:05,915 --> 01:45:10,033
Think of all those young boys
you've influenced.

1385
01:45:10,275 --> 01:45:12,266
There are so many of them.

1386
01:45:17,155 --> 01:45:19,271
That day in Chicago,
why did you stand up?

1387
01:45:20,035 --> 01:45:22,265
I didn't want to see you fail.

1388
01:45:30,435 --> 01:45:31,948
I wish Dad could've...

1389
01:45:36,635 --> 01:45:38,591
God, I love baseball.

1390
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:48,706
Are you gonna go to the game tomorrow?

1391
01:45:53,995 --> 01:45:55,189
Is your son with you?

1392
01:45:58,635 --> 01:45:59,954
He is.

1393
01:46:05,955 --> 01:46:06,990
Excuse me.

1394
01:46:17,475 --> 01:46:19,591
Well, I gotta go.

1395
01:46:59,315 --> 01:47:02,352
Tomorrow, after we've lost...

1396
01:47:03,035 --> 01:47:06,027
...I want Pop Fisher out of here,
bag and baggage.

1397
01:47:06,355 --> 01:47:08,391
That's right. Lay it all
on the line, Harry.

1398
01:47:08,635 --> 01:47:10,387
All of it.
That's right. You heard me.

1399
01:47:17,435 --> 01:47:18,345
I'll call back.

1400
01:47:21,315 --> 01:47:22,509
Slugger, you okay?

1401
01:47:24,075 --> 01:47:24,951
I'm fine.

1402
01:47:25,195 --> 01:47:27,390
- You look a little lost.
- I'm not.

1403
01:47:31,395 --> 01:47:33,386
You dropped this on your way out.

1404
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:36,630
Something seems amiss.

1405
01:47:36,835 --> 01:47:39,429
Correct me if I'm wrong, Hobbs,
but we had a deal.

1406
01:47:40,675 --> 01:47:41,744
No.

1407
01:47:43,555 --> 01:47:44,908
Those are your winnings.

1408
01:47:45,115 --> 01:47:46,992
This is a gag.
Pick it up, get out.

1409
01:47:47,235 --> 01:47:50,511
If it isn't enough money,
tell us what you've got in mind.

1410
01:47:50,715 --> 01:47:51,591
To hit away.

1411
01:47:54,395 --> 01:47:56,351
I thought I could rely on your honour.

1412
01:47:56,635 --> 01:47:57,590
You're about to.

1413
01:47:58,075 --> 01:48:00,384
You're a foolish, foolish man.

1414
01:48:01,115 --> 01:48:02,628
You've forgotten something.

1415
01:48:03,755 --> 01:48:04,585
Your past.

1416
01:48:04,795 --> 01:48:06,786
I don't care. Go on.

1417
01:48:06,995 --> 01:48:08,394
Get on the phone.

1418
01:48:09,435 --> 01:48:10,504
No.

1419
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:12,672
That won't be necessary.

1420
01:48:13,355 --> 01:48:14,993
I like the action.

1421
01:48:18,915 --> 01:48:20,633
Then let it ride.

1422
01:48:22,715 --> 01:48:24,068
You bastard!

1423
01:48:36,395 --> 01:48:37,794
I hate you.

1424
01:48:46,595 --> 01:48:47,823
I hate you.

1425
01:48:56,315 --> 01:48:57,828
You were right, Memo.

1426
01:48:59,315 --> 01:49:01,033
We have met before.

1427
01:49:02,115 --> 01:49:06,188
You're a lot weaker than I thought.
What do you think this changes?

1428
01:49:07,115 --> 01:49:11,108
Have Max draw you a picture. You can
read about it in the morning paper.

1429
01:49:11,835 --> 01:49:14,065
You're yesterday's news, kid.

1430
01:49:14,635 --> 01:49:17,274
You had a great gift, a talent.
But it's not enough.

1431
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:23,673
I think you're a loser.

1432
01:49:34,115 --> 01:49:35,833
You can't let him go.

1433
01:49:38,995 --> 01:49:40,314
Relax.

1434
01:49:40,555 --> 01:49:44,025
With his insides, he's as good
to us now as he was before.

1435
01:49:45,075 --> 01:49:47,543
Besides, we're $20,000 richer.

1436
01:49:57,675 --> 01:50:01,634
I wanted to win that pennant worse than
I wanted any goddamned thing in my life.

1437
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:05,026
You'd think I could
just this once, wouldn't you?

1438
01:50:06,075 --> 01:50:08,589
I didn't care nothing
about the Series.

1439
01:50:09,075 --> 01:50:12,351
Win or lose,
I would have been satisfied.

1440
01:50:12,715 --> 01:50:16,230
I'd have walked away from baseball,
and I'd have bought a farm.

1441
01:50:17,395 --> 01:50:19,033
Nothing like a farm.

1442
01:50:22,955 --> 01:50:25,515
Nothing like being around animals,
fixing things.

1443
01:50:25,755 --> 01:50:30,306
There's nothing like being in the field
with the corn and the winter wheat.

1444
01:50:34,715 --> 01:50:36,546
The greenest stuff you ever saw.

1445
01:50:37,955 --> 01:50:40,913
You know, my mother told me
I ought to be a farmer.

1446
01:50:44,275 --> 01:50:46,743
My dad wanted me to be
a baseball player.

1447
01:50:48,995 --> 01:50:51,350
You're better than
anyone I ever had.

1448
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:55,344
And you're the best
goddamned hitter I ever saw.

1449
01:50:59,195 --> 01:51:00,674
Suit up.

1450
01:51:36,915 --> 01:51:38,906
Still dogging me, huh, Max?

1451
01:51:40,475 --> 01:51:41,624
End of the road, Hobbs.

1452
01:51:41,955 --> 01:51:44,185
You wanna hear what I think
our chances are?

1453
01:51:44,715 --> 01:51:46,353
You read my mind.

1454
01:51:47,355 --> 01:51:48,868
That takes all of 3 seconds.

1455
01:51:50,555 --> 01:51:53,353
They come and they go, Hobbs.
They come and they go.

1456
01:51:53,595 --> 01:51:56,712
I'll be around here longer
than you or anybody else here.

1457
01:51:56,915 --> 01:51:58,871
I'm here to protect this game.

1458
01:52:00,515 --> 01:52:01,914
Whose game?

1459
01:52:02,795 --> 01:52:06,265
I do it by making
or breaking the likes of you.

1460
01:52:07,355 --> 01:52:09,311
Did you ever play ball, Max?

1461
01:52:14,475 --> 01:52:15,954
No, never have.

1462
01:52:16,395 --> 01:52:18,863
But I make it a little
more fun to watch, you see.

1463
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:21,743
And after today, whether
you're a goat or a hero...

1464
01:52:22,395 --> 01:52:24,192
...you're gonna make me a great story.

1465
01:52:27,715 --> 01:52:28,545
See you around.

1466
01:52:36,755 --> 01:52:39,553
<i>And here come the New York Knights</i>
<i>as they take the field.</i>

1467
01:52:39,755 --> 01:52:43,270
<i>Everyone will have their eyes</i>
<i>on Hobbs, whose illness came close...</i>

1468
01:52:43,475 --> 01:52:45,750
<i>... to shattering</i>
<i>the Knights' dream of a pennant.</i>

1469
01:52:45,995 --> 01:52:48,463
<i>Hobbs moving to his position</i>
<i>in right field.</i>

1470
01:52:48,675 --> 01:52:52,554
<i>And just listen to that crowd</i>
<i>go wild for Hobbs!</i>

1471
01:52:54,435 --> 01:52:56,232
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

1472
01:53:04,955 --> 01:53:06,229
Let's go, Knights!

1473
01:53:06,435 --> 01:53:08,585
<i>He looks like he's set</i>
<i>and ready to go.</i>

1474
01:53:09,195 --> 01:53:11,470
<i>This is for the National</i>
<i>League Pennant!</i>

1475
01:53:11,715 --> 01:53:14,912
<i>The Knights versus Pittsburgh!</i>
<i>The playoff game!</i>

1476
01:53:15,195 --> 01:53:16,025
Play ball!

1477
01:53:16,715 --> 01:53:20,594
<i>Al Fowler on the mound. Two outs</i>
<i>as he faces Schaffer. The pitch!</i>

1478
01:53:21,275 --> 01:53:25,348
<i>Schaffer swings! Fly ball going out</i>
<i>over the field! Hobbs goes back fast!</i>

1479
01:53:32,155 --> 01:53:34,749
<i>The Pirates go down 1-2-3</i>
<i>in the 1 st inning.</i>

1480
01:53:34,995 --> 01:53:38,146
- Feel okay?
<i>- Bivens going in against Youngberry.</i>

1481
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,351
<i>Youngberry, ex cellent control.</i>

1482
01:53:40,555 --> 01:53:42,944
<i>18 and 9 on the season.</i>
<i>The pitch!</i>

1483
01:53:43,555 --> 01:53:45,864
<i>Strike 3, inside corner!</i>

1484
01:53:46,315 --> 01:53:50,103
<i>Now batting, number 18, John Olsen.</i>

1485
01:53:51,155 --> 01:53:52,713
Come on, Roy!

1486
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:56,991
<i>And strike 1 on Olsen.</i>

1487
01:53:58,795 --> 01:53:59,591
<i>Strike 2!</i>

1488
01:53:59,795 --> 01:54:03,788
<i>Hobbs kneels next to Bobby Savoy,</i>
<i>the batboy for the Knights.</i>

1489
01:54:05,075 --> 01:54:07,509
<i>Strike 3! Olsen badly fooled!</i>

1490
01:54:07,755 --> 01:54:11,065
<i>Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!</i>

1491
01:54:11,275 --> 01:54:12,594
Come on, Roy!

1492
01:54:12,795 --> 01:54:15,832
<i>And listen to that chant!</i>
<i>The Roy Hobbs chant!</i>

1493
01:54:16,075 --> 01:54:17,667
<i>Hobbs batting.</i>

1494
01:54:29,755 --> 01:54:31,507
<i>Hobbs bats against Youngberry.</i>

1495
01:54:32,315 --> 01:54:33,145
<i>Youngberry...</i>

1496
01:54:33,355 --> 01:54:36,028
<i>... who made fifth place this year.</i>
<i>Here's the pitch!</i>

1497
01:54:36,235 --> 01:54:37,304
<i>Swung on and missed!</i>

1498
01:54:37,755 --> 01:54:39,507
<i>Hobbs fooled by that pitch.</i>

1499
01:54:39,715 --> 01:54:41,990
<i>Now stepping back to the plate.</i>
<i>Youngberry gets set.</i>

1500
01:54:42,235 --> 01:54:45,068
<i>Hobbs has been 3 for 6</i>
<i>so far this season.</i>

1501
01:54:45,275 --> 01:54:47,345
<i>Youngberry looking in for the sign.</i>

1502
01:54:47,595 --> 01:54:49,665
<i>He goes to the wind-up.</i>

1503
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:50,830
<i>The pitch!</i>

1504
01:54:51,075 --> 01:54:54,465
/<i>nside corner, strike 2! The</i>
<i>crowd was not happy with the pitch.</i>

1505
01:54:54,675 --> 01:54:55,664
<i>An ex cellent call.</i>

1506
01:54:55,915 --> 01:55:00,352
<i>Youngberry looks in once again.</i>
<i>Hobbs sets himself. The concentration.</i>

1507
01:55:00,595 --> 01:55:02,313
<i>Youngberry to the wind-up.</i>
<i>The pitch!</i>

1508
01:55:03,395 --> 01:55:05,351
<i>Strike 3!</i>
<i>Hobbs is out of there.</i>

1509
01:55:06,035 --> 01:55:09,152
<i>And so at the end of one inning,</i>
<i>no score at all.</i>

1510
01:55:09,355 --> 01:55:12,392
<i>The big question is whether or not</i>
<i>Hobbs can get his timing back.</i>

1511
01:55:12,595 --> 01:55:16,747
<i>After a four-day layoff, it's difficult</i>
<i>for a hitter to step into the game.</i>

1512
01:55:16,995 --> 01:55:21,511
Hobbs came directly to the field with
no batting practice this afternoon.

1513
01:55:22,955 --> 01:55:24,752
<i>At the end of 3 innings,</i>
<i>no score.</i>

1514
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:29,034
<i>Fowler looking in against Boyle.</i>
<i>Boyle, the count, 3 and 1.</i>

1515
01:55:29,835 --> 01:55:32,065
<i>The pitch! And he walks.</i>

1516
01:55:36,195 --> 01:55:38,789
<i>Terrific so far this afternoon.</i>
<i>Here comes Allen.</i>

1517
01:55:39,595 --> 01:55:43,304
<i>Allen's last time up grounded</i>
<i>out to 1 st base. Fowler looking in.</i>

1518
01:55:43,595 --> 01:55:44,948
<i>Boyle over on 1 st base.</i>

1519
01:55:45,475 --> 01:55:47,306
<i>Allen has good power.</i>

1520
01:55:51,555 --> 01:55:52,954
<i>Allen swings! Fly ball!</i>

1521
01:55:53,195 --> 01:55:55,026
<i>Back, back! Hobbs drifting back.</i>

1522
01:55:55,275 --> 01:55:56,867
<i>That's out of here!</i>

1523
01:55:58,835 --> 01:56:00,393
<i>The score is 2 to nothing.</i>

1524
01:56:00,595 --> 01:56:02,108
<i>Pittsburgh strikes first.</i>

1525
01:56:04,155 --> 01:56:07,750
<i>Fowler up until this point</i>
<i>has been absolutely outstanding.</i>

1526
01:56:07,955 --> 01:56:11,231
<i>That one got away from him.</i>
<i>Fowler not happy with it at all.</i>

1527
01:56:14,235 --> 01:56:16,874
<i>You can feel the anxiety</i>
<i>spreading through this crowd.</i>

1528
01:56:17,115 --> 01:56:18,343
Time!

1529
01:56:18,595 --> 01:56:20,233
<i>This is a little unusual.</i>

1530
01:56:20,435 --> 01:56:24,223
<i>Roy Hobbs has called time out</i>
<i>and is heading in to see Fowler.</i>

1531
01:56:25,155 --> 01:56:27,271
/<i>t's kind of an unusual situation.</i>

1532
01:56:29,035 --> 01:56:30,150
Play ball!

1533
01:56:32,315 --> 01:56:33,145
Don't do it.

1534
01:56:33,355 --> 01:56:35,664
If this is for show,
you can cut the crap.

1535
01:56:39,035 --> 01:56:40,912
Give them the real stuff, Al.

1536
01:56:41,755 --> 01:56:43,393
I'll start pitching
when you start hitting.

1537
01:56:45,755 --> 01:56:47,029
What the hell's going on?

1538
01:56:47,795 --> 01:56:49,148
It's a surprise.

1539
01:56:49,355 --> 01:56:50,265
It's okay, Pop.

1540
01:56:51,275 --> 01:56:52,185
Let's play ball.

1541
01:57:02,275 --> 01:57:04,266
<i>Two to nothing,</i>
<i>the Knights at bat.</i>

1542
01:57:04,675 --> 01:57:06,905
- This is it, Roy!
- Swing it, Hobbs!

1543
01:57:07,715 --> 01:57:11,344
<i>Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!</i>

1544
01:57:15,275 --> 01:57:16,310
Come on, Roy!

1545
01:57:20,235 --> 01:57:21,987
<i>Youngberry, the pitch!</i>

1546
01:57:22,795 --> 01:57:25,150
<i>A swing and a miss.</i>
<i>Hobbs misses.</i>

1547
01:57:25,955 --> 01:57:27,991
<i>Swing and a miss!</i>
<i>Strike 2!</i>

1548
01:57:30,715 --> 01:57:33,548
<i>Strike 3!</i>
<i>Hobbs falls to the ground!</i>

1549
01:57:34,315 --> 01:57:37,785
<i>Hobbs tried and missed it.</i>
<i>Knocked him to the ground.</i>

1550
01:57:37,995 --> 01:57:40,714
<i>Picks himself up again.</i>
<i>Youngberry overpowering.</i>

1551
01:57:40,915 --> 01:57:44,430
<i>Hobbs just hasn't been able</i>
<i>to put it together this evening.</i>

1552
01:57:45,795 --> 01:57:47,706
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1553
01:57:47,955 --> 01:57:49,229
Excuse me.

1554
01:57:51,155 --> 01:57:52,634
It's all right, slugger!

1555
01:57:52,875 --> 01:57:54,274
Come on, Hobbs!

1556
01:57:54,675 --> 01:57:56,870
It's important
that Roy Hobbs gets this.

1557
01:57:57,115 --> 01:57:58,434
I just can't do that.

1558
01:57:58,675 --> 01:58:03,226
I know. I have his son in the stands.
He doesn't know his son is here.

1559
01:58:03,475 --> 01:58:06,308
- I can't do it.
- Please. I don't know what to say.

1560
01:58:07,355 --> 01:58:11,394
<i>At the end of 6 innings,</i>
<i>no score at all for the Knights.</i>

1561
01:58:18,715 --> 01:58:22,151
<i>At the end of 6 innings,</i>
<i>again, 2 to nothing.</i>

1562
01:58:22,395 --> 01:58:23,953
<i>The Knights still...</i>

1563
01:59:46,795 --> 01:59:50,151
<i>LaJong hits the ball into the field!</i>
<i>Here comes the throw!</i>

1564
01:59:50,515 --> 01:59:52,312
<i>And Frenchie is out of there!</i>

1565
01:59:52,715 --> 01:59:56,071
<i>Shouldn't have gone for two.</i>
<i>He's trying to get something started.</i>

1566
01:59:56,275 --> 01:59:59,233
<i>At the end of 7,</i>
<i>2 to nothing, Pittsburgh.</i>

1567
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:02,389
<i>Fowler's been overpowering</i>
<i>ever since the 4th inning.</i>

1568
02:00:02,635 --> 02:00:04,114
<i>Getting himself settled down.</i>

1569
02:00:04,355 --> 02:00:06,550
<i>Fowler looking in against Yancey.</i>
<i>The pitch!</i>

1570
02:00:06,795 --> 02:00:08,945
<i>Throw, swing and a miss!</i>
<i>Strike 3!</i>

1571
02:00:09,315 --> 02:00:12,830
<i>At the top half of the 9th,</i>
<i>still 2 to nothing.</i>

1572
02:00:13,475 --> 02:00:16,911
<i>Two outs right now. Bivens going</i>
<i>back to get himself another bat.</i>

1573
02:00:17,155 --> 02:00:21,148
<i>Nothing has worked so far.</i>
<i>Maybe he'll try another one. Bivens...</i>

1574
02:00:21,355 --> 02:00:23,585
<i>... 0 for 2 today. The pitch!</i>

1575
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:25,627
<i>There's the shot over the right field!</i>

1576
02:00:26,755 --> 02:00:29,144
<i>Allen picks it up.</i>
<i>He's throwing it!</i>

1577

1580
02:00:54,915 --> 02:00:57,873

1591
02:02:11,595 --> 02:02:15,224

<i>Taking no chances at all. That's it.</i>

1592
02:02:15,475 --> 02:02:19,787

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1607
02:03:08,275 --> 02:03:11,108
<i>He's trying to destroy</i>
<i>the press box right next to us!</i>

1608
02:03:11,315 --> 02:03:14,785
