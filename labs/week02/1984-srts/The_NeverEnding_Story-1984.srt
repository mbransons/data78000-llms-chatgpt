1
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,301
Good morning, Bastian.

2
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:59,253
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.

3
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:05,325
I understand, son.

4
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,728
But we have to get on with things, right?

5
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,307
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.

6
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,110
We can't let Mom's death...

7
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,147
...be an excuse
for not getting the job done, right?

8
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,282
Yes.

9
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,830
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.

10
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,069
I got a call from your math teacher
yesterday.

11
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,740
She says that you were...

12
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:09,309
...drawing horses in your math book.

13
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,078
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

14
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:13,645
What?

15
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,881
Nothing.

16
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,384
She also says you don't
do your homework on time.

17
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,823
I'm very disappointed you didn't even
try out for the swimming team.

18
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,894
As to those riding lessons you wanted....

19
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:38,098
You say you love horses
but you're afraid to get on a real one.

20
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,170
You're old enough to get your head down
out of the clouds and...

21
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:47,439
...and keep both feet on the ground.

22
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,776
Okay.

23
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:03,985
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

24
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:12,825
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

25
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:15,694
We should have more.

26
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:18,764
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

27
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,599
But, yesterday I wasn't.

28
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,439
Hey, it's the weirdo.

29
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:33,609
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

30
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,748
Let's get him !

31
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:51,790
You can't get away.

32
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:53,958
You're dead, chicken!

33
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:55,292
We'll get you!

34
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,797
-Where's your money?
-I don't have any!

35
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,265
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.

36
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,135
If you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

37
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,744
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.

38
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:28,485
Who said you could get out of the garbage?

39
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,320
Get back in there.

40
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,788
Not again.

41
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:33,789
Not again!

42
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,724
Where are you going, wimp?

43
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:47,100
-He went that way.
-Which way?

44
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,206
Get out of here! I don't like kids.

45
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:13,654
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?

46
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,689
You're hiding, aren't you?

47
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,792
The video arcade is down the street.

48
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:23,929
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.

49
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,532
They require effort and make no beeps.

50
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:28,599
On your way.

51
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,536
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.

52
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,104
Comic books.

53
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,005
No, I've read Treasure lsland...

54
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,474
... The Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz...

55
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,509
...Lord of the Rings,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.

56
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,248
Who are you running away from?

57
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,620
Some kids from school.

58
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,388
Why?

59
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,590
They threw me in the garbage.

60
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:01,825
Why not punch them in the nose?

61
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,629
I don't know.

62
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,636
What's that book about?

63
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,339
Oh, this is something special.

64
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,646
Well, what is it?

65
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:31,382
Look.

66
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,319
Your books are safe.

67
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:38,488
While you're reading them...

68
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,592
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

69
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,827
But that's what I like about them.

70
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:49,830
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

71
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,165
What do you mean?

72
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,833
Listen.

73
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,037
Have you ever been...

74
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,505
...Captain Nemo...

75
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:06,310
...trapped inside your submarine
while the giant squid is attacking you?

76
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:09,779
Yes.

77
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,515
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?

78
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,783
But it's only a story.

79
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,519
That's what I'm talking about.

80
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,054
The ones you read...

81
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,522
...are safe.

82
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,359
And that one isn't?

83
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,395
Don't worry about it.

84
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:33,031
But you just said it was--

85
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,672
Forget about it.

86
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,575
This book is not for you.

87
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,784
Koreander's.

88
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,887
What can I do for you?

89
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,128
They run maybe 300, 370....

90
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,664
It will take me a couple of a weeks.

91
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,808
Math test. Oh, no!

92
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:17,794
{Y:i}"lt was midnight in the Howling Forest.

93
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:22,331
{Y:i}"The wind whistled
through the tops of the ancient trees.

94
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,000
{Y:i}"Suddenly, something enormous...

95
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,036
{Y:i}"...crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods. "

96
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,091
What's that?

97
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,821
Excuse me...

98
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:38,258
...but would it be all right
if I joined you this evening?

99
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,896
You see, I've been traveling all day.

100
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,186
Now I see why you picked this camp.

101
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:29,265
A delicious looking limestone rock!

102
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,836
Nice bouquet.

103
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:39,172
Must be a real vintage year.

104
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,209
Yes, you're right.

105
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,712
Those delicious rocks
are the reason we've camped here.

106
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,149
-Is he a nutcase?
-No, he's a Rock Biter.

107
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,584
A Rock Biter!

108
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,765
-Sorry.
-Poor baby.

109
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:17,736
Pardon me.

110
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:23,407
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.

111
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,877
Very tasty.

112
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,915
Where I come from in the North,
we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.

113
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,918
Only now...

114
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,220
...now...

115
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:42,456
...they're all gone.

116
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:45,391
I know how it happened.

117
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,560
I swear it wasn't me.

118
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:53,131
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.

119
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:57,501
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

120
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,669
...but then...

121
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:03,072
...then it was gone.

122
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,374
Did the lake dry up?

123
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,776
No. It just wasn't there anymore.

124
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:13,714
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

125
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:15,482
A hole?

126
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:19,718
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.

127
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:24,088
And it got bigger and bigger.

128
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,925
First, there was no lake anymore.

129
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,728
And then, finally, no rocks.

130
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:42,503
If he keeps stuffing his face like that,
soon there won't be any rocks here either.

131
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,006
Night Hob, this could be serious!

132
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,941
Rock Biter...

133
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,177
...what you told us is also happening
where I live in the West.

134
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,346
A strange sort of Nothing
is destroying everything.

135
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:58,849
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there, too.

136
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:05,054
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?

137
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:10,058
Maybe, it's already everywhere.

138
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,766
Maybe our whole land is in danger.

139
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,134
What can we do?

140
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:27,172
My people are sending me to
the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.

141
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,006
We are on the same--

142
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:34,444
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...

143
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,012
...who could?

144
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,614
Then why are we all just sitting here...

145
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,917
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?

146
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,185
What are we waiting for?

147
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:46,587
Yes. Let's go now.

148
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,121
Wake up!

149
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,756
Come on, old girl.

150
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,791
We can't just hang around here.

151
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,727
Wake up! Ready for take off.

152
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:56,928
Oh, stupid bat!

153
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:01,432
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?

154
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:04,901
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.

155
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,805
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.

156
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,443
It really is a racing snail.

157
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:18,912
Nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

158
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:35,025
Maybe I'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks, for the road....

159
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,146
The Nothing!

160
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:18,660
Look!

161
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:21,762
There it is!

162
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,198
The heart of Fantasia !

163
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:49,851
I never knew it was that beautiful.

164
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,096
Stay awake!

165
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:09,366
I told you to stay awake.

166
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:59,139
The home of the Empress.

167
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,808
She's our only hope.

168
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:38,837
Friends, I know why you are all here.

169
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,572
The Nothing...

170
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:46,476
...is destroying our world.

171
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,247
I also know that you...

172
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,082
...have come to beseech...

173
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,085
...the Empress for help.

174
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,456
But I have terrible news.

175
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,961
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

176
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,100
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

177
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,370
She's dying.

178
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,777
So, she cannot save us.

179
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,115
But there just might be one chance.

180
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:42,787
The Plains People
who hunt the purple buffalo...

181
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,289
...have among them a great warrior.

182
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:49,793
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

183
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:53,496
He is our only hope.

184
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:59,200
His name is Atreyu.

185
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:20,317
Atreyu.

186
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:33,794
{Y:i}"The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.

187
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:38,465
{Y:i}"When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...

188
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:43,168
{Y:i}"...he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia. "

189
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,450
A little boy!

190
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:07,254
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

191
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:09,889
You must leave.

192
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:13,225
If you don't want me here,
you shouldn't have sent for me.

193
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:17,562
Is he a nutcase?

194
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:20,331
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.

195
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:22,499
I am Atreyu.

196
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,569
Not Atreyu the Child.

197
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:28,537
Atreyu the Warrior.

198
00:24:28,604 --> 00:24:31,273
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.

199
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:34,542
But I'll be happy to go back
to hunting the purple buffalo.

200
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,411
Wait!

201
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,249
Come back, please.

202
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,594
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...

203
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:00,596
...you would be willing to go on a quest?

204
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:04,599
Yes, of course.

205
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,401
What kind of a quest?

206
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:10,170
To find a cure for the Empress...

207
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,440
...and to save our world.

208
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:19,011
No one can give you any advice
except this:

209
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,680
You must go alone.

210
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,416
You must leave all your weapons behind.

211
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:31,120
It will be very dangerous.

212
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,590
Any chance of success?

213
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:37,959
I do not know.

214
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,261
But if you fail...

215
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:43,296
...the Empress will surely die...

216
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:46,599
...and our whole world will be destroyed.

217
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:08,750
When do I begin?

218
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:14,021
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.

219
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:16,556
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

220
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,362
Take this.

221
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:34,904
The Auryn!

222
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:45,512
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

223
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:49,115
It will guide and protect you.

224
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,293
Wake up.

225
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,061
Farewell, Atreyu.

226
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:08,063
Take care.

227
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:47,261
{Y:i}"A t the same time...

228
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,364
{Y:i}"...elsewhere in Fantasia,
a Creature of Darkness...

229
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:54,333
{Y:i}"...also began his quest. "

230
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,153
{Y:i}"They had been traveling aimlessly
for almost a week...

231
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:23,656
{Y:i}"...but they couldnot find a cure
for the Empress.

232
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:28,560
{Y:i}"Neither Atreyu nor his horse, Artax,
had the vaguest suspicion...

233
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:32,330
{Y:i}"...that the Creature of Darkness,
the Gmork...

234
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:35,399
{Y:i}"...was already tracking them down. "

235
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:46,341
What is it, Artax?

236
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:50,711
Is it time to go already?

237
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:56,549
I know what you want. It's time to eat.

238
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,020
Good idea.

239
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,589
No, it's a great idea !

240
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:26,873
No, not too much.

241
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,743
We still have a long way to go.

242
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:38,296
{Y:i}"A treyu and Artax had searched
the Silver Mountains...

243
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,799
{Y:i}"...the Desert of Shattered Hopes
and the Crystal Towers...

244
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,034
{Y:i}"...without success.

245
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,603
{Y:i}"And so, there was only one chance left.

246
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:51,073
{Y:i}"To find Morla, the Ancient One...

247
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,975
{Y:i}"...the wisest being in Fantasia...

248
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:56,910
{Y:i}"...whose home was the Shell Mountain...

249
00:30:57,077 --> 00:31:01,648
{Y:i}"...somewhere in the deadly
Swamps of Sadness. "

250
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:13,157
Come on, boy. Come on.

251
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,435
That's it.

252
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,373
It's okay.

253
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:38,010
{Y:i}"Everyone knew that
whoever let the sadness overtake him...

254
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,678
{Y:i}"...would sink into the swamp. "

255
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:42,747
You're doing fine, Artax.

256
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,793
Come on, Artax.

257
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,899
What's the matter?

258
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,501
What's wrong?

259
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:17,040
Come on, boy.

260
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,210
What's the matter?

261
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:24,446
I understand.

262
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,885
It's too difficult for you.

263
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,723
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!

264
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:40,659
Turn around! You have to! Now!

265
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,198
Fight against the sadness.

266
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,802
Artax, please.

267
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,771
Don't let the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

268
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:59,607
You have to try. You have to care.

269
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:02,176
For me.

270
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,811
You're my friend. I love you.

271
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:11,383
Artax, stupid horse.

272
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,419
You got to move or you'll die.

273
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,721
Move. Please.

274
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,923
I won't give up. Don't quit.

275
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,391
Artax!

276
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,732
The Shell Mountain.

277
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:04,739
Morla, the Ancient One.

278
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:50,109
Morla.

279
00:36:56,127 --> 00:37:00,597
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

280
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:04,300
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

281
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:15,042
Not that it matters, but yes.

282
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:18,678
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

283
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,880
Well...

284
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:24,149
...we haven't seen...

285
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:28,219
...the Auryn in a long time.

286
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,954
We?

287
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:34,157
Is there someone else here, too?

288
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:38,994
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

289
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:42,731
...for thousands of years.

290
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:46,934
So we started talking...

291
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,002
...to ourselves.

292
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,714
Morla, I bring terrible news.

293
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,116
Did you know the Empress is ill?

294
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:10,119
Not that it matters, but yes.

295
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:13,755
Actually, we don't care.

296
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:15,823
If I don't save her, she'll die.

297
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,626
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the land.

298
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,027
Don't you care?

299
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,595
We don't even care...

300
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,599
...whether or not we care.

301
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:35,005
Do you have a cold?

302
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:39,409
No. We're allergic...

303
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,877
...to youth.

304
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,416
You know how to help the Empress,
don't you?

305
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:51,018
Not that it matters...

306
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:54,020
...but yes.

307
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:58,290
If you don't tell me and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.

308
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,626
Die?

309
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,029
That, at least, would be something.

310
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:19,140
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.

311
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,243
We're tired of sneezing.

312
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,080
Go away! Nothing matters.

313
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:31,517
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.

314
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,621
Clever boy.

315
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:38,155
Tell me, please.

316
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,824
We don't know.

317
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:44,560
But you can ask...

318
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,096
...the Southern Oracle.

319
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,630
How can I get there?

320
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,331
You can't.

321
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,570
It's 10,000 miles away.

322
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,941
But that's so far.

323
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:03,809
That's right.

324
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:06,944
Forget it.

325
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:10,280
Give up.

326
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:42,453
No.

327
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:46,556
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

328
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,534
Oh, boy!

329
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:37,911
{Y:i}"After days and nights
of unconsciousness...

330
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:41,080
{Y:i}"...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...

331
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:45,750
{Y:i}"...and found himself
in strange surroundings.

332
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:49,520
{Y:i}"He was clean and
his wounds were dressed. "

333
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,502
Leaving so soon?

334
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,576
I was just going to....

335
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,711
I have to....

336
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:05,146
-I was trying to--
-Sneak away?

337
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:07,682
Yes. I mean, no.

338
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:09,550
I like children.

339
00:45:10,384 --> 00:45:11,652
For breakfast?

340
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,689
Never. I'm a luck dragon.

341
00:45:17,356 --> 00:45:19,324
My name is Falkor.

342
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:24,362
-And my name is--
-Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

343
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:25,863
How did you know that?

344
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:27,598
You were unconscious.

345
00:45:28,498 --> 00:45:30,233
You talked in your sleep.

346
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:35,637
Could you get around...

347
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:39,907
...and scratch behind my right ear?

348
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,877
I can never quite reach it.

349
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:50,916
Here?

350
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,293
That's so good.

351
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:06,595
Thank you.

352
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:14,201
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

353
00:46:14,535 --> 00:46:16,936
Yes. But it's hopeless.

354
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,607
-It's too far away.
-I wouldn't necessarily say that.

355
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:24,476
You know how to get there?

356
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:28,079
Sure. It's right around the corner.

357
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,980
How did all this happen?

358
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:32,849
With luck.

359
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,752
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?

360
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,657
No. Only 9,891 ...

361
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,925
...as the dragon flies.

362
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:46,960
You're amazing.

363
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:52,731
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

364
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:55,267
Things will work out fine.

365
00:46:56,801 --> 00:47:00,638
Never give up and good luck will find you.

366
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:05,408
It's good to have a friend again.

367
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:11,146
You have more than one.

368
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:14,315
Look.

369
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:13,262
Get out of my light, wench.

370
00:48:13,395 --> 00:48:15,830
You're disturbing my scientific work.

371
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:18,532
You and your scientific work.

372
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:22,702
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

373
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:27,173
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

374
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,375
But not until he's well.

375
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,878
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

376
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,647
I'm always finding you in my place.

377
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,184
He's well.

378
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:43,952
Now it's my turn with him.

379
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:45,787
No, you don't!

380
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:50,257
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.

381
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:54,761
Well, little man, still in pain?

382
00:48:55,228 --> 00:48:56,329
It's all right.

383
00:48:56,396 --> 00:49:00,732
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.

384
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,035
It has to hurt if it's to heal.

385
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,539
Drink that.

386
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:11,641
Good?

387
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,610
That's my bat-wing broth.

388
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:18,880
There's eye of newt in there,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

389
00:49:18,947 --> 00:49:22,283
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

390
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:26,453
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

391
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:28,254
What are you on to?

392
00:49:28,488 --> 00:49:31,657
Anything of interest
to the scientific community?

393
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:34,726
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.

394
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,594
Here we go again.

395
00:49:36,794 --> 00:49:39,563
You've come to the right place, my boy.

396
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:42,999
I am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

397
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:46,101
"lt is my scientific specialty."

398
00:49:46,435 --> 00:49:48,570
It is my scientific specialty.

399
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:53,874
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

400
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:55,909
You keep quiet, wench.

401
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,544
It's my turn.

402
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,916
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

403
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,618
I don't think so.

404
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:09,753
You don't move in scientific circles.

405
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:12,989
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.

406
00:50:13,723 --> 00:50:15,925
You've come to the right place.

407
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:18,160
There's no fool like an old fool.

408
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:20,662
Wait! Stay here.

409
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:24,765
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

410
00:50:30,203 --> 00:50:33,606
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

411
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:39,811
I've been studying
the Southern Oracle for years.

412
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:42,012
Some day I'll publish my book:

413
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:45,882
A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle,
by Professor Engywook.

414
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:48,251
Volume l.: The Early Years.

415
00:50:50,386 --> 00:50:52,554
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

416
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:54,622
What do you think?

417
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,857
I work scientifically.

418
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:20,810
Look.

419
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,385
Is that the Southern Oracle?

420
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:35,555
No. It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

421
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:38,290
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...

422
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:41,526
...and get me the final information
for my book.

423
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:46,096
Of course, most people...

424
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:49,099
...never get that far.

425
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Why?

426
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:53,469
The Sphinxes' eyes...

427
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:58,139
...stay closed until someone
who does not feel his own worth...

428
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:00,040
...tries to pass by.

429
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:12,117
Here comes one that looks fancy.

430
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:21,057
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.

431
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,831
Go on, scaredy-cat!

432
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:38,204
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.

433
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:39,972
He's going on.

434
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:42,908
I think he'll make it.

435
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:48,045
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.

436
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,180
They're shut.

437
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,584
The eyes are opening!

438
00:53:11,163 --> 00:53:13,599
Did he make it? Did he?

439
00:53:20,337 --> 00:53:22,672
Fancy armor doesn't help.

440
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:27,676
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

441
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,780
Listen.

442
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,350
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.

443
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:42,421
I'm going to try.

444
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:46,825
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.

445
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:49,026
It's even worse than this one.

446
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,427
He'll never make it.

447
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:09,204
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.

448
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,043
Be confident.

449
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:25,750
Run, Atreyu!

450
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,019
Run, Atreyu!

451
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:33,156
Run! Now!

452
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:48,868
He made it.

453
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:50,436
He made it.

454
00:56:57,742 --> 00:57:00,711
He made it!

455
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:07,983
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.

456
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:12,887
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.

457
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:16,257
-I always said he could do it.
-Good.

458
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:21,761
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

459
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:24,463
I knew he'd be safe.

460
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,466
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.

461
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:34,371
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

462
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:38,207
Atreyu must face his true self.

463
00:57:38,274 --> 00:57:42,377
So what? That won't be too hard for him.

464
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:44,946
That's what everyone thinks.

465
00:57:45,446 --> 00:57:48,616
But kind people find that they are cruel.

466
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,986
Brave men discover
they are really cowards.

467
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,021
Confronted with their true selves...

468
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:59,591
...most men run away screaming.

469
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,585
Now, this is going too far.

470
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:19,535
What if they...

471
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:23,137
...really do know about me in Fantasia?

472
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:14,011
The Southern Oracle?

473
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:35,461
Do not be afraid.

474
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:38,464
We will not harm you.

475
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:45,102
We have been waiting for you a long time.

476
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,507
Are you the Southern Oracle?

477
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,610
Yes, we are.

478
01:01:55,077 --> 01:01:57,745
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

479
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:00,714
Yes, we do.

480
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:05,051
Well, what is it? I have to know!

481
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:06,853
The Empress...

482
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,722
...needs...

483
01:02:10,322 --> 01:02:12,123
...a new name.

484
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:17,695
A new name? That's all?

485
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:19,463
But that's easy.

486
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,299
I can give her any name she wants.

487
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:26,335
No one from Fantasia...

488
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:28,970
...can do it.

489
01:02:29,404 --> 01:02:32,039
Only a human child...

490
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:35,742
...can give her this new name.

491
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:44,282
A human child? Where can I find one?

492
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,118
You can only find one...

493
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:52,288
...beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.

494
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:01,162
Ifyou want to save our world...

495
01:03:01,996 --> 01:03:03,798
...you must hurry.

496
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,568
We don't know...

497
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:12,571
...how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.

498
01:03:16,408 --> 01:03:18,276
Falkor!

499
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,294
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.

500
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:43,195
Don't worry.

501
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:47,198
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.

502
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:51,135
-Do you know where they are?
-I have no idea.

503
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:54,404
Then how do we find a human child?

504
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:56,406
With luck.

505
01:03:57,907 --> 01:04:00,909
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

506
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:03,945
All right, hang on tight.

507
01:05:16,436 --> 01:05:19,071
What a shame they don't ask me.

508
01:05:20,105 --> 01:05:21,439
My mother...

509
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:24,876
...she had such a wonderful name.

510
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:45,025
{Y:i}"On and on they flew
until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...

511
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,427
{Y:i}"...where they could go no further."

512
01:05:49,762 --> 01:05:52,097
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.

513
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:53,746
Atreyu.

514
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:24,336
Falkor!

515
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:30,742
Where are you?

516
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:55,661
Atreyu! Where are you?

517
01:08:47,402 --> 01:08:50,304
They look like big...

518
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:54,708
...good, strong hands, don't they?

519
01:08:56,376 --> 01:09:00,379
I always thought that's what they were.

520
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:07,384
My little friends.

521
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:10,487
The little man with his racing snail...

522
01:09:10,787 --> 01:09:12,388
...the Night Hob...

523
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:15,724
...even the stupid bat.

524
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:19,494
I couldn't hold on to them.

525
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:22,129
The Nothing...

526
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:26,733
...pulled them right out of my hands.

527
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:29,969
I failed.

528
01:09:30,436 --> 01:09:33,438
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.

529
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:36,708
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.

530
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:40,210
But I lost the Auryn.

531
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:42,879
I can't find my luck dragon.

532
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,682
So I won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

533
01:09:55,222 --> 01:09:56,557
Listen.

534
01:09:57,124 --> 01:09:58,625
The Nothing...

535
01:09:59,092 --> 01:10:00,993
...will be here any minute.

536
01:10:01,627 --> 01:10:04,129
I will just sit here...

537
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,332
...and let it take me away, too.

538
01:10:08,933 --> 01:10:10,601
They look...

539
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:13,303
...like good...

540
01:10:13,737 --> 01:10:15,572
...strong...

541
01:10:15,772 --> 01:10:18,974
...hands, don't they?

542
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:22,658
Morla?

543
01:11:26,094 --> 01:11:27,595
Artax!

544
01:12:18,869 --> 01:12:20,870
If you come any closer...

545
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,907
...l will rip you to shreds.

546
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:33,113
Who are you?

547
01:12:33,214 --> 01:12:35,549
I am Gmork.

548
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,419
And you, whoever you are...

549
01:12:41,086 --> 01:12:44,823
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

550
01:12:48,592 --> 01:12:50,294
I will not die easily.

551
01:12:51,028 --> 01:12:52,696
I am a warrior.

552
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,132
Brave warrior.

553
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,500
Then fight the Nothing.

554
01:12:58,567 --> 01:13:02,470
I can't. I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

555
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:06,607
What's so funny?

556
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:10,543
Fantasia has no boundaries.

557
01:13:16,881 --> 01:13:18,216
That's not true.

558
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:21,185
-You're lying.
-Foolish boy.

559
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:26,089
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?

560
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:29,958
It's the world of human fantasy.

561
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:34,128
Every part...

562
01:13:34,962 --> 01:13:36,530
...every creature...

563
01:13:37,297 --> 01:13:41,634
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

564
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:45,637
Therefore...

565
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,440
...it has no boundaries.

566
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:59,215
Why is Fantasia dying then?

567
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:03,318
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

568
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:07,254
...and forget their dreams.

569
01:14:08,422 --> 01:14:11,258
So the Nothing grows stronger.

570
01:14:11,758 --> 01:14:13,259
What is the Nothing?

571
01:14:13,526 --> 01:14:16,195
It's the emptiness that's left.

572
01:14:17,596 --> 01:14:19,764
It is like a despair...

573
01:14:20,265 --> 01:14:22,433
...destroying this world.

574
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,303
And I have been trying to help it.

575
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:29,338
But why?

576
01:14:29,705 --> 01:14:32,708
Because people who have no hopes...

577
01:14:33,442 --> 01:14:35,710
...are easy to control.

578
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:39,780
And whoever has the control...

579
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,550
...has the power.

580
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,230
Who are you, really?

581
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,798
I am the servant...

582
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,202
...of the power behind the Nothing.

583
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:11,772
I was sent to kill the only one...

584
01:15:12,406 --> 01:15:14,741
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

585
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,711
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

586
01:15:19,345 --> 01:15:20,679
His name...

587
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,314
...was Atreyu.

588
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:32,021
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.

589
01:15:32,755 --> 01:15:36,291
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!

590
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:10,132
Falkor!

591
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,141
Atreyu!

592
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,828
{Y:i}"That was the end of Fantasia.

593
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:50,497
{Y:i}"Only a few fragments ofthis once...

594
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:54,934
{Y:i}"...rich and beautiful world
had been left by the Nothing. "

595
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:07,244
Good old Falkor.

596
01:18:07,778 --> 01:18:12,148
-Can you see anything? Anything at all?
-No.

597
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:15,951
All the land is gone.

598
01:18:17,118 --> 01:18:20,454
I know. And all because I failed.

599
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,223
You tried.

600
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,159
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?

601
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:30,796
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.

602
01:18:35,633 --> 01:18:37,634
Let the Auryn guide you.

603
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:43,372
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

604
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:04,856
The Ivory Tower!

605
01:20:08,139 --> 01:20:09,640
The Empress.

606
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,195
Go on.

607
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:20,963
Why do you look so sad?

608
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:39,611
I have failed you, Empress.

609
01:21:44,348 --> 01:21:45,483
You haven't.

610
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,852
You brought him with you.

611
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,888
Who?

612
01:21:52,555 --> 01:21:54,757
The earthling child.

613
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:57,092
The one...

614
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:59,327
...who can save us all.

615
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:02,229
You knew about the earthling child?

616
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:07,166
Of course. I knew everything.

617
01:22:08,734 --> 01:22:12,104
My horse died, I nearly drowned.

618
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,772
I just barely got away from the Nothing.

619
01:22:14,906 --> 01:22:17,708
For what? To find out
what you already knew?

620
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:21,111
It was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

621
01:22:21,378 --> 01:22:23,646
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!

622
01:22:25,414 --> 01:22:27,082
Yes, you did.

623
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,784
He has suffered with you.

624
01:22:31,019 --> 01:22:34,021
He went through everything
you went through.

625
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:38,091
Andnow, he has come here...

626
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,192
...with you.

627
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,529
He is very close, listening...

628
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:49,800
...to every word we say.

629
01:22:50,334 --> 01:22:51,335
What?

630
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,216
Where is he?
lf he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?

631
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:20,391
He doesn't realize
he's already part of The Neverending Story.

632
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:24,661
The Neverending Story?

633
01:23:24,728 --> 01:23:26,329
What's that?

634
01:23:26,396 --> 01:23:29,865
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...

635
01:23:29,965 --> 01:23:32,467
...others are sharing his.

636
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:34,268
They were with him...

637
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,471
...when he hid from the boys
in the bookstore.

638
01:23:40,073 --> 01:23:41,774
But that's impossible!

639
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:44,510
They were with him
when he took the book...

640
01:23:44,677 --> 01:23:46,745
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...

641
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:51,182
...in which he's reading his own story...

642
01:23:52,049 --> 01:23:53,550
...right now.

643
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:01,056
I can't believe it.

644
01:24:02,524 --> 01:24:04,859
They can't be talking about me.

645
01:24:08,128 --> 01:24:10,163
What if he doesn't appear?

646
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:12,632
Then our world will disappear.

647
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,301
And so will l.

648
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,405
How could he let that happen?

649
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:25,275
He doesn't understand that he's the one
with the power to stop it.

650
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,811
He simply can't imagine...

651
01:24:27,877 --> 01:24:30,746
...that one little boy
could be that important.

652
01:24:33,549 --> 01:24:35,016
Is it really me?

653
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:37,585
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

654
01:24:38,052 --> 01:24:39,520
What do I have to do?

655
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:43,256
He has to give me a new name.

656
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:45,758
He's already chosen it.

657
01:24:46,892 --> 01:24:48,861
He just has to call it out.

658
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:55,232
But it's only a story. It's not real.

659
01:24:55,366 --> 01:24:56,433
It's only a story.

660
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,936
Atreyu, no!

661
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:26,324
Bastian!

662
01:25:28,392 --> 01:25:32,061
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

663
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:35,831
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.

664
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,799
Call my name.

665
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,404
Bastian, please!

666
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:46,740
Save us!

667
01:25:46,806 --> 01:25:48,908
All right! I'll do it!

668
01:25:49,175 --> 01:25:52,878
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.

669
01:26:18,064 --> 01:26:20,066
Why is it so dark?

670
01:26:20,933 --> 01:26:24,770
In the beginning, it is always dark.

671
01:26:29,774 --> 01:26:31,275
What is that?

672
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:34,010
One grain of sand.

673
01:26:34,644 --> 01:26:38,314
It is all that remains of my vast empire.

674
01:26:46,153 --> 01:26:48,922
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

675
01:26:50,423 --> 01:26:51,924
Yes.

676
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,295
Then everything's been in vain.

677
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,298
No, it hasn't.

678
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,267
Fantasia can arise anew...

679
01:27:05,869 --> 01:27:08,504
...from your dreams and wishes.

680
01:27:10,339 --> 01:27:11,473
How?

681
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:14,075
Open your hand.

682
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,155
What are you going to wish for?

683
01:27:33,424 --> 01:27:34,725
I don't know.

684
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,396
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.

685
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,634
How many wishes do I get?

686
01:27:48,236 --> 01:27:50,204
As many as you want.

687
01:27:51,071 --> 01:27:53,540
And the more wishes you make...

688
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:57,710
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

689
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,177
Really?

690
01:28:00,112 --> 01:28:01,579
Try it.

691
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:16,625
Then my first wish is....

692
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:28,801
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

693
01:28:39,843 --> 01:28:43,346
-Like it?
-Falkor, it's wonderful.

694
01:28:48,316 --> 01:28:51,986
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.

695
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:12,969
Atreyu and Artax!

696
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,582
What would you like to wish for next?

697
01:29:59,506 --> 01:30:01,474
Look, there they are.

698
01:30:03,009 --> 01:30:04,476
It's a monster!

699
01:30:05,644 --> 01:30:09,447
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.

700
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:11,115
Down here.

701
01:30:25,726 --> 01:30:28,162
We're going to get you!

702
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,217
{Y:i}Bastian made many other wishes...

703
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:59,520
{Y:i}...and had many other
amazing adventures...

704
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:03,621
{Y:i}...before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.

705
01:31:04,985 --> 01:31:07,985
{Y:i}But that's
another story!
