00:00:56,118 --> 00:01:01,884
<i>...but first here with the highlights of the latest news...
8 a.m. Eastern War Time... September 14th.

3
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,919
<i>When the 5th Army advanced to the Gulf of Salerno in Italy...

4
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,336
<i>...extremely heavy fighting continues.

5
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,139
<i>The Germans are using tanks
and elements of three divisions

6
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,969
<i>with Hermann Goering
and the 15th and 16th Panzers.

7
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,077
<i>At one or two points they have regained some
of the ground taken from them in the last day or two,

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,689
<i>but the powerful Allied Forces receiving
a steady stream of reinforcements and supplies,

9
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,481
<i>are advancing steadily to gain the foothills
arcing around the coastal plain...

10
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:27,881
<i>...that we made our landing.

11
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,679
<i>We have firmly established
ourselves in the coastal area,

12
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:33,438
<i>but as long as German artillery
in place in the foothills...

13
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,461
Come on, James, get some sleep.

14
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,090
We MIGHT have missed something.

15
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:43,594
A thousand triple checks and
we might have missed something?

16
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:46,379
James, tomorrow we make history!

17
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:48,846
See you in the morning.

18
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:52,062
<i>...back yesterday, which gives a clear picture of the fighting.

19
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:56,124
<i>Details of an American unit which advanced,
knocking-out 12 enemy tanks...

20
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,702
<i>...the projected backup
is a German counterattack

21
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:02,009
<i>overrunning one of our observation
posts with several war tanks.

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,686
<i>Enemy fighters, approximately a hundred and twenty are...

23
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,636
I really have to talk to you about your friend.

24
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,423
Would you stop that!

25
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:48,867
What kind of girl do you think I am?

26
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:53,577
I figured you're the kind that understands
that this might be my last dance.

27
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:56,534
That's a lot of malarkey and you know it.

28
00:02:56,755 --> 00:03:01,251
All you're doing is taking a joy-ride around the harbor
and getting out of the war for six months.

29
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,835
Isn't that a great excuse though?

30
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,435
We're not going back to the office and that's final.

31
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,368
- Take care of junior for me.
- Okay.

32
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,203
That's more my speed!

33
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,131
How do you fell about an old,
married man who's raring to go?

34
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,090
Sure!

35
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,832
- Hey, is it okay?
- No, it's not.

36
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:46,884
- C'mon. Hey, Babe, you wanna cut a rug.
- Why not?

37
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:58,645
- Motherhood suits ya.
- Is that a compliment?

38
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,896
Yes, it's supposed to.
Jimmy's a lucky guy.

39
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:04,154
Well, you had your chance.

40
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,865
Yeah, I guess I did.

41
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,330
Want something to drink?

42
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,076
A Coke.

43
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,299
Give me a beer and a Coke.

44
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,919
Hey, there goes the Whiz Kid.

45
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,112
<i>He doesn't look too happy, does he?

46
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,217
Maybe he knows somethin' we don't.

47
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:32,226
Thanks, Steve, that's just what I wanted to hear.

48
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,384
- Hey, uh, how's it going with Doris?
- None of your business.

49
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,375
When are you going to California?

50
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:59,582
Tomorrow. Since you're gonna be quarantined
for a month, there's no use in my staying.

51
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:02,880
Yeah.. hey, say hello to everybody for me, all right?

52
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,861
I will. Have you heard from your dad?

53
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:12,508
No. He's up at Sacramento. He's not gonna
let the war get in the way of his racing.

54
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,264
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this'll be the last dance.

55
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,557
- What?
- The last dance!

56
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:22,380
See ya, Babe.

57
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,505
- Look after Jimmy for me, will ya?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,891
Come on, Honey, it's the last dance.

59
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:19,141
Pam! Davy, look, it's Pam!

60
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,322
Hi, Pam! I hear the baby!

61
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:27,756
Hi! Hi!
- I love you, Sweetie! I love you! I'll miss you.

62
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:30,128
I love you!

63
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,907
You worried about losing your job, Joe?

64
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,245
I'll believe it when I see him do it.

65
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,492
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

66
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:12,094
You fellas goin' on another joy-ride?

67
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:16,588
Hey, Smitty, I heard your old lady ran off with a Skimmer Puke.

68
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:20,043
- I heard it was an Airedale.
- I heard it was both of 'em!

69
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,604
Well, we get to go out
without Pam tonight, hotshot!

70
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:33,472
- Yeah, we'll be in quarantine's time tonight.
- Forget quarantine!

71
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:36,109
- I got it all worked out, buddy.
- Yeah?

72
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,428
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Sir.

73
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,443
- Is everything in order?
- Yes, Sir.

74
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,963
Have you checked the communications link to the shore?

75
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,284
Yes, Sir! Clear as a bell!

76
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:17,491
<i>Now hear this: All visitors prepare to disembark,
except for special sea detail. Prepare to get underway!

77
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:22,374
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

78
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:49,563
<i>Range 2000 yards</i>, bearing 1-2-8.

79
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,699
- No way they're gonna hide this turkey!
- Now you see it, now you don't.

80
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,284
All right, Men, let's concentrate!

81
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:12,679
<i>Now here this: Secure the specialty
and anchor detail, set the underway watch.

82
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,599
<i>Experimental detail, prepare for the Rainbow One.

83
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,208
<i>The smoking lamp is out throughout the ship.

84
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:37,112
Hey, Joe, you've met
Dr. Longstreet and his assistant?

85
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,342
Welcome aboard, Sir.

86
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,376
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

87
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,411
The ships are on-station, Sir.

88
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,138
You can start the generators now, Captain.

89
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,760
Commence operations.

90
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,893
This is Sea Dog<i> to Small Boy,
activate Rainbow One.</i>

91
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:02,848
<i>This is Small Boy, roger, out.

92
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,934
<i>- All sections, stand-by for countdown.</i>
- Here we go!

93
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:28,380
- Generators activated, Sir.
- Power to the main field.

94
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,448
I don't believe this!

95
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,150
The Eldridge is beginning to fade, Sir!

96
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,032
<i>She's gone!

97
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,856
<i>I didn't think it was</i> possible.

98
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,166
- She's radar invisible!
<i>- Congratulations, Doctor!</i>

99
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:33,982
Looks like you've just taken
<i>the entire German fleet out of this war.</i>

100
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:53,378
- How is it?
- It's gettin' kinda spooky in here!

101
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:54,002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

102
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:18,634
Captain Robertson, Sir, it's the cutter.
They say that the Eldridge has vanished!

103
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,365
Of course she has, she's radar invisible!

104
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,412
No, Sir, she's REALLY vanished!

105
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:23,622
She's gone!

106
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:25,995
Get me the captain of the Eldridge
on the radio right away!

107
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,458
It's impossible!

108
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,711
<i>Small Boy this is Sea Dog, over.

109
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,853
<i>Small Boy this is Sea Dog.

110
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,197
Shut that down!

111
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:38,512
Tell the others to kill the generators.
TELL 'EM!!!

112
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,893
- They've broken-off communications, Sir.
- Keep trying.

113
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:47,652
<i>Attention all the search
and rescue personnel, stand-by!

114
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:51,185
<i>Repeat, all search and rescue personnel, stand-by!

115
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,656
What is going on here?

116
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,917
- What is it?
- Shut the damn thing... shut it down!

117
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:14,438
- Jimmy! Are you okay?
- I'm okay! Get outta here!

118
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:15,591
Let get the hell outta here!

119
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:24,559
C'mon! Get up!

120
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,092
What is this? What's goin' on?

121
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:58,157
- I don't know, what do you see right now?
- The stars, the moon, it's night!

122
00:15:58,308 --> 00:16:00,597
Did you see the ship? I mean did...
you see the ship, the town?

123
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,096
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's spinnin' around!
What's goin' on here?

124
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,834
- What about your hand?
- It looks okay now, there's nothing wrong with it.

125
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,031
- What the hell is it?
- I don't know... what is that?

126
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,164
<i>It's comin' back again, Davy!

127
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,368
Oh, my god.

128
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:37,596
C'mon!

129
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,358
Run!

130
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,741
Run! Run!

131
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:13,509
Let go, Jimmy! Let go!

132
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,508
We gotta get outta here!
C'mon! Run!

133
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,448
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

134
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,413
- It's the last one.
- Thanks.

135
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,077
- You have any more brilliant ideas?
- Yeah.

136
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:16,067
We're still in Philadelphia.
This is all part of the experiment.

137
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,193
They did something to our minds!

138
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:23,515
- There's no desert in Philly.
- Maybe all this isn't real.

139
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:27,116
Maybe it's a hallucination,
they could've hypnotized us.

140
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:28,830
Ya know, they do that to people, ya know?

141
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,293
You're tellin' me this is my imagination?
And we're not freezin' our asses off out here?

142
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,418
And they didn't try to kill us last night?

143
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:39,052
They wouldn't do that!
It's all part of the experiment.

144
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,720
You think the Navy
knows what they're doing?

145
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,975
You saw the guys on the boat. This wasn't
supposed to happen, Jimmy! This is a BIG mistake.

146
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:51,601
- So what do we do, huh?
- Let's keep on goin'.

147
00:18:55,699 --> 00:19:02,345
- Isn't that water up ahead?
- No, this is a desert, and that's a mirage.

148
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:19,053
How much longer do you think
this mirage is gonna last?

149
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:31,098
- What is it?
- Some sorta beer.

150
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:35,609
German!

151
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,389
Hey!

152
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:45,165
Coca-cola!

153
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:49,950
Oh, it's so light!
What the hell's it made of?

154
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,840
Well, hell if I know.

155
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:07,181
- What is it?
- It's an old Chevy.

156
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:13,126
<i>It's headin' right for us.</i>
- C'mon!

157
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,415
What the hell was that?

158
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:43,512
<i>Red Leader to Dry Wells Base,
we don't see any town site.

159
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,766
<i>Dry Wells Base to Red Leader,
repeat!

160
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,892
<i>It was there before the experiment,
it's got to be there now! Keep looking!

161
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:54,958
<i>How could the damn town just disappear?
Continuing search, over.

162
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:10,580
That's Longstreet now, punch-up code 84
and run another check of the area.

163
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,474
We just finished our first run.

164
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,813
There's nothing, no anomalous electromagnetic fields.

165
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,022
No heat build-up, no radiation.

166
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,241
The whole damned town just
disappeared, James!

167
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:42,781
Run a second check.

168
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:47,665
We are already doing it, but, I mean,
how the hell could this thing have happened?

169
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:52,375
I don't want Washington involved... not yet.

170
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:57,064
I understand.
We'll be through in an hour.

171
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:15,319
All right, I want a shot here and then I want
a shot featuring that section down there.

172
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,901
And then I want a wide shot of the whole assembly.

173
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:20,862
What is it?

174
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,788
We don't know, Sir, but it wasn't here
when we started, that's for DAMN sure.

175
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,996
The chopper went down
over there by the security fence.

176
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,997
There's not a piece of it left
that's bigger than a matchstick.

177
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,460
How about the security breach?

178
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:38,674
CQ's checking into it, but I can
guarantee you it's a mistake.

179
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,424
Not even a jack rabbit could get through this perimeter.

180
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:43,264
Excuse me, Sir.

181
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:44,792
Clark here.

182
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:48,492
<i>- We got somethin' for ya.</i>
- Right! Griffin! Let's go!

183
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,168
Three-eighths, it's hard steel coil,
haven't seen anything like it in at least 30 years!

184
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:08,409
If I was back in Missouri, I'd swear
there was a tornado brewing-up there.

185
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,894
Hey, man, what's happening?

186
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:12,396
- You comin' in, or what?
- Yeah.

187
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,497
<i>You boys want some coffee?

188
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:43,779
Yes.

189
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:47,369
We got a special on the ham and eggs.

190
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,815
Yeah, sounds good.

191
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,414
- Yeah, me, too.
- How do you want the eggs?

192
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,196
- Scrambled.
- Two specials, scrambled!

193
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,267
At least she speaks English.

194
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:07,697
You don't mind?

195
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,709
- Wha... what... what's the name of this place?
- Scotty's Junction.

196
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,541
You won't find it on any map, I can tell ya' that!

197
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:19,252
Nevada?

198
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,716
You boys don't know what state you're in?

199
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:26,997
Yeah, there's a... there's a navy base around here?

200
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:30,386
<i>Not that I know of.</i>
Just the base up at Dry Wells.

201
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:31,002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

202
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:33,477
That's it!

203
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:38,940
- Do you have a phone?
- Outside, by the pump.

204
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:42,481
Give me some of that money,
see if I can get a hold of Base.

205
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,426
What?

206
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,347
You gave the job to somebody else?

207
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:16,410
I... I did call! I called from Chicago, I called
from Salt Lake! Didn't he get the message?

208
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:21,269
I don't think you understand!
I quit my job to come work for you.

209
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,524
Of course I'm upset!
I've been driving for two days!

210
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:30,215
No, I don't wanna come stay with you.

211
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,324
What for?
There's nothing to talk about.

212
00:26:33,544 --> 00:26:37,527
Look, there's someone waiting for the phone... goodbye.

213
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,548
Thank you.

214
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:59,524
Operator, yes, I want to call long distance, Philadelphia.

215
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,069
United States Naval Base.

216
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:07,368
Well, yeah, I gotta reverse the charges,
this is Seaman First Class David Herdeg.

217
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:09,156
Want a Commander Robertson.

218
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:20,040
<i>- How are your victuals, Sir.
- Hey, Ben!

219
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:26,380
<i>You got any Sweet 'n' Low?

220
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:31,851
The Sweet 'n' Low.

221
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,748
- Don't take any checks or credit cards.
- Thanks.

222
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,842
<i>Hey!</i> What in the hell do you think you're doing?

223
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,280
C'mon back here, boy!

224
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:08,205
- We gotta get outta here, Davy.
- What's goin' on?

225
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:09,908
All right, hold it right there, boy!

226
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:12,936
Now, you're paying for both them machines
before you leave my place.

227
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:14,278
I didn't do anything to your machines!

228
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,323
Mister, I don't know
what you're talkin' about...

229
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:18,231
You shut up, or I'll blow your head off, too.

230
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,797
- Pa, I already called the Sheriff.
- Now, you just get back inside.

231
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:23,635
All right, stay back! Everybody! Stay back!

232
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:25,351
- Easy, Mister! C'mon, take it easy.
<i>- Get back!</i>

233
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:26,955
- Get in the car, Jimmy.
- I didn't do anything, Davy.

234
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:28,403
Just get in the car!

235
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:35,474
Stay back, just stay back, we'll get 'em later.

236
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,491
Where are the keys?

237
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,869
It's everything I own,
could you take another car?

238
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:41,376
Just give me the damn keys!

239
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,601
What's the matter?!?

240
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,274
- Where the hell's the clutch?
- It's automatic!

241
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,435
<i>What is an "automatic"?

242
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,207
- Get in, you're driving.
- Jesus Christ.

243
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:02,294
Hey, forget the bag!

244
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:06,887
- I'm not leaving without my stuff.
- For God's sake, get in the car!

245
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:12,471
Go! <i>Go! Come on! Go! Go!</i>

246
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,084
Look, I'll cooperate,
but just don't hurt me, okay?

247
00:29:27,305 --> 00:29:30,114
- We're not gonna hurt you, just keep on drivin'.
- Did you get through to the Base.

248
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:33,149
They never even heard of a Commander
Robertson... that's what they said.

249
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,897
But that's a lie!
Why would they do that?

250
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,304
Let me see that.

251
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:41,935
It doesn't feel too good, Davey.
It happened again back there.

252
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:45,883
You know, you should be in the hospital.
He should be in a hospital, you know that!

253
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:48,182
What's the date?

254
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,300
- The date, it's the 17th.
- The year!

255
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:54,642
Are you kidding?
It's 1984!

256
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,838
What's going on with you two?
Are you on drugs or something?

257
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,233
- 1984.
- What about the War?

258
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,136
- What war?
- The War!

259
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,123
Vietnam?

260
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,800
World War II,
Germany and Japan!

261
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:08,550
What about it?

262
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,810
Who won?

263
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,532
We won, what do you think?

264
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,545
Are you guys putting me on or somethin'?

265
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,048
- How far to the next town?
- I don't know.

266
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,711
Hey, do you have any cigarettes?

267
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,150
No, I quit last month.

268
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:50,300
<i>Roger, one-niner, you're advised
to clear quadrant Delta...

269
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,878
<i>Roger, this is one-niner, we copy,
standing by for base communications.

270
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:09,106
Good morning, Sir.

271
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:11,216
- Is Dr. Longstreet down there?
- Yes, he is.

272
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,431
I don't understand any significant
difference between this experiment

273
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:32,018
and any other anti-missile
test we've run so far.

274
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:32,945
Larry!

275
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:38,223
- It wouldn't be enough to do it.
- Of course it would, it's the only variable.

276
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,784
The amount of energy it took to deflect
the missiles into hyperspace was so great

277
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,521
<i>- Look!
- it created a wrinkle in the continuum!

278
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,310
<i>We shut the energy off,
we turned the generators down,

279
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,488
<i>why didn't the town simply re-materialize?

280
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,148
Maybe there is another power source functioning.

281
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:56,275
- Where?
- Inside the zone, in hyperspace itself.

282
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,789
What would be the possible source?

283
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,448
- Did you get the meteorological report?
- Yes.

284
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:06,954
It's incredible, it's as if every storm front in the
region were being sucked <i>into this one tiny zone.</i>

285
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,765
<i>We have three separate reports
of tornadoes, and that doesn't happen here.

286
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,863
Where's it centered now?

287
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,875
- Major Clark wants to see you.
<i>- About 40 miles due east of here.

288
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:15,487
I'll be back.

289
00:32:16,187 --> 00:32:18,165
What other the possible energy source?

290
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,288
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I thought you
should know, there WAS a security break.

291
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:26,949
At least two men were in the area of the experiment
when it took place, I put out a full alert.

292
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:29,415
So much for the jack rabbit theory.

293
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:34,519
- We'll catch them, I can guarantee THAT.
- When you do, I'll want to see them.

294
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:35,621
Jimmy, look at this!

295
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:39,449
<i>I don't like it, Davey, it's all wrong.

296
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:42,458
- PLEASE, can we find a hospital?
- Just keep drivin'.

Ya know, there's nothing wrong with my arm,
it's just a little bit sore.

around back, we can rent a new one in the morning.

451
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:06,091
Oh, I see you found an old movie to watch?

452
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:08,846
Yeah, it's the only thing I seem
to understand around here.

Are you okay?

459
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:42,841
What if we get all the way out to Santa Paula, and...

460
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:47,439
there's nobody left out there left alive that I know?

David, everyone has a phone... let's try.

Uh, yes, information please for
Santa Paula, California, the number for...

Right, right, right.

Is there any other place?

Try the Parker Ranch, they always had a phone.

469
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:25,044
Do you have the number for the Parker Ranch?

Thank you.

471
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,529
It's ringing.

But what... what am I gonna say to 'em?

473
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,291
Hello, who's this speaking, please?

474
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,776
Pam?

475
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:54,331
What happened?

476
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,082
It was her!
It was Jim's wife, Pamela.

477
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,791
Well, why... why did you hang up?

478

What am I gonna say to her?

479
00:51:01,884 --> 00:51:05,010
Well, that's good, at least
we know she's there.

480
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:09,761
What if they're there? What if they're waitin' for us?
They know where I'm from, this could all be a trap!

481
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:13,854
Well... maybe we should tell
the story to someone else

482
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:16,512
- and get them to come with us.
- Wait, the story you don't believe, right, that one?

483
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:19,984
David, I don't know what to believe,
how do you know what to believe? Maybe...

484
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,233
maybe they gave you some drugs,
maybe none of this is real at all.

485
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:27,487
Yeah, maybe none of this is real.
Hey! Maybe this isn't real, right?

486
00:51:27,703 --> 00:51:30,236
Maybe this isn't real! I mean, maybe this
isn't real, maybe none of this is real!

487
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:31,907
Maybe I'm not real!
Maybe you're not real!

488
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:33,405
How about that?

489
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:41,585
Look...

490
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,906
All right, ya know, I don't think
I can really help you anymore,

491
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:48,930
I think you gotta go through
this, ya know, by yourself, and...

492
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:55,186
I'm sure you're gonna be fine, but,
ya know, I'm scared, too, so, I'll see ya later, okay?

The latest run.

01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:25,268
- Unleaded?
- Yeah.

598
01:03:31,188 --> 01:03:33,763
- Is that him?
- Yes.

599
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:35,893
<i>Good looking man.

600
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,416
That's the car we bought out with us
when we moved from New Jersey.

601
01:03:43,972 --> 01:03:47,771
- That's you.
<i>- That's right.</i>

602
01:03:49,227 --> 01:03:53,955
<i>Hey, your car was almost full.</i>
Did you want me to check the oil?

603
01:03:53,982 --> 01:03:55,440
No, that's okay.

604
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,942
Do you know what happened to
the guy in these pictures?

605
01:03:57,978 --> 01:04:00,094
- What, John Herdeg?
- Yeah.

606
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:05,067
Well, he was a pretty famous guy,
won a helluva a lot of big races in his time.

607
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:09,907
- When was that?
- Oh, I don't know, late '40s, early '50s I guess.

608
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:17,510
<i>He moved back East somewhere, that's where most of
the racing circuits are... died a few years ago.

609
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:25,208
Your car was <i>almost full...
it's only 4 dollars.</i>

610
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:28,517
<i>I'm sorry.

611
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,737
David?

612
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,437
Thanks.
<i>David!</i>

613
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,987
- Do you want me to drive?
- No, I'm fine.

614
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:16,940
I'm sorry, David.

615
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,485
But at least he made it.

616
01:05:22,197 --> 01:05:27,195
He did what he said he was gonna do
when nobody thought he could, not even me!

617
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,997
Good for you, Pop.

618
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:35,078
Good for you!

619
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:13,176
- I shoulda called her again.
- It'll be okay.

620
01:06:15,294 --> 01:06:17,572
What if she doesn't recognize me?

621
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:20,600
We'll just tell her.

622
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:12,268
Can you help you?

623
01:07:12,644 --> 01:07:15,086
- Mrs. Parker?
- Yes.

624
01:07:15,976 --> 01:07:19,904
- Pamela?
- Yes.

625
01:07:20,401 --> 01:07:25,071
Don't you know me?
Don't you recognize me?

626
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:29,517
It's me, it's David.
It's Davey Herdeg.

627
01:07:32,998 --> 01:07:36,410
- No, it's not, it can't be.
- It's me, Pam.

628
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,590
Please help me.

629
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,389
Oh my God, David!

630
01:07:52,998 --> 01:07:54,870
May we come in?

631
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:57,843
Ah... yes.

632
01:07:58,505 --> 01:08:00,824
I'm Allison.

633
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:26,511
All of this time he was telling the truth.

634
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:32,446
All of this time and nobody
would believe him, not even me.

635
01:08:33,227 --> 01:08:35,797
- Who was telling the truth?
- Jimmy.

636
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:39,646
- Then he came back!
- Yes.

637
01:08:41,778 --> 01:08:43,773
<i>Well, what happened?

638
01:08:44,989 --> 01:08:48,939
Well, nobody would listen to him.
We all believed the Navy,

639
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,121
and they said he had been
affected by the experiment.

640
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,454
And the ship and the other guys?

641
01:08:55,668 --> 01:08:59,249
Burned, some of them, some of them died.

642
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:02,862
What about me?
What happened to me, Pamela?

643
01:09:04,093 --> 01:09:06,262
You never came back, David.

644
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:09,135
You just never came back...

645
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:13,921
'til now.

646
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:25,949
Jimmy?

647
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,832
He still likes to go out there and work.

648
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,871
I'll be right back.

649
01:09:39,665 --> 01:09:41,270
<i>Davey!

650
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,326
- He's not like he used to be.
- I know.

651
01:10:03,445 --> 01:10:04,616
Jimmy.

652
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:07,960
<i>Jimmy, it's me, David.

653
01:10:10,848 --> 01:10:13,217
I know you recognize me, Jimmy.

654
01:10:13,601 --> 01:10:17,840
I just want to talk to you about
what... about what happened.

655
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:22,289
Now, what's the matter, c'mon,
stop this, I want to talk to you.

656
01:10:24,883 --> 01:10:27,647
Now, c'mon, talk to me, stop the horse!

657
01:10:28,429 --> 01:10:30,671
Stop this god damned horse and talk to me, damn it!

658
01:10:30,786 --> 01:10:33,693
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me what happened!

659
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:36,995
Get him outta here!
Just get him outta here!

660
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,029
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened!

661
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:43,442
- What's the matter?
- Jimmy?

662
01:10:44,049 --> 01:10:46,247
- Jimmy?
- What's happening? What's going on?

663
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,529
I better go now, I'm afraid he's
going to get sick, please, please go.

664
01:10:48,742 --> 01:10:50,616
Wait! You can't do this!
You've got to help David!

665
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:54,119
He can't go through this again!
Please, please leave him alone!

666
01:10:58,085 --> 01:11:03,296
- David, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

667
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,812
Why didn't you want to speak with him, Jimmy?

668
01:11:18,313 --> 01:11:19,938
What for?

669
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:25,397
He just wanted you to tell him some things.

670
01:11:26,384 --> 01:11:28,426
It's better he doesn't know.

671
01:11:29,658 --> 01:11:31,361
Why don't you come sit down?

672
01:11:35,456 --> 01:11:39,039
I can't go through all that again, Pamela.

673
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:41,960
I just can't.

674
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:45,796
I know you can't, Jimmy,
I do understand.

675
01:11:55,518 --> 01:11:58,290
He looks just the same, doesn't he?

676
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,012
Yes, he does.

677
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:05,293
I wish to God it was all over for him.

678
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:21,306
I'm goin' back.

679
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:26,859
It won't do any good, he's frightened,
he's a sick man, she told me.

680
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,441
I don't care.

681
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,207
David, they thought he was
crazy, they put him in a hospital,

682
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,881
do you think he wants to
go through that again?

683
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,551
All I want to do is talk to him.

684
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:40,658
You already know what happened,
you didn't go back, David.

685
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:44,591
What happened to him
is not gonna happen to you.

686
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,982
Oh shod!

687
01:13:03,316 --> 01:13:05,550
Jesus Christ!

688
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:08,484
Slow him down!

689
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,542
Look out!

690
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:20,480
<i>- David!</i>
- Get down! Shit! <i>Shit!</i> Shit!

691
01:13:22,254 --> 01:13:23,634
<i>Keep going!

692
01:13:30,562 --> 01:13:32,616
<i>Get down! Get down!

693
01:13:50,537 --> 01:13:52,161
Hang on!

694
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:11,757
Look out!

695
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:14,945
- Hold on!
<i>- David, stop!</i>

696
01:14:24,213 --> 01:14:26,272
David, where are you going?

697
01:14:29,843 --> 01:14:31,675
<i>David, come on!

698
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:33,697
Damn it!

699
01:14:33,814 --> 01:14:36,334
Please, David, let's get out of here!

700
01:14:39,394 --> 01:14:40,646
Dry Wells.

701
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,924
- David, we gotta get out of here...
- Dry Wells!

702
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:46,145
This is close to the place that me and
Jimmy first came in in the desert.

703
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:49,668
Please, David, these are federal documents, let's go.

704
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:54,364
This is the guy! This is the guy who was in charge
of the experiment we were in, Dr. James Longstreet!

705
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:57,438
All right, get in the car, this guy
will know exactly what's goin' on.

706
01:14:57,496 --> 01:15:00,914
- David, they're gonna be looking for this car.
- We'll get there some other way.

707
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:10,751
Easy on his arm there! Easy! Easy!

708
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,286
We're just crossing the Nevada border.

709
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:49,665
What's goin' on, Allison?

710
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:58,369
C'mon, what's the matter?

711
01:16:04,107 --> 01:16:07,245
Why can't you just let it go?

712
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:14,974
I mean... we could go away somewhere,
together, just... just you and me.

713
01:16:14,993 --> 01:16:17,237
Allison, I can't let it go,
I gotta find out!

714
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:21,601
Is it worth dying for? It's not worth it.

715
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:25,390
It's not worth killing people for.

716
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:28,020
THEY were trying to kill US, remember?

717
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,262
Look, if you want to bail-out of
this, ya know, I'll understand.

718
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,744
I don't know what the hell
you're doing here anyway.

719
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,419
No, I don't want to leave you.

720
01:16:51,009 --> 01:16:54,936
I'm just... I'm just frightened.

721
01:16:56,786 --> 01:17:00,180
Oh, jeez, come here.

722
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:13,172
<i>The canyon's is closed, hold it up right there!

723
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,342
<i>I said turn around! Turn around!

724
01:18:29,799 --> 01:18:34,068
<i>Make arroyo, Jack, walk to arroyo, turn around.

725
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:39,733
Looks like a road block.

726
01:18:41,686 --> 01:18:45,306
What is it, David? What? Tell me!

727
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:49,765
- It's happening to me now.
- No.

728
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:52,707
All right, we gotta get out of here,

729
01:18:52,744 --> 01:18:55,026
- I gotta find Longstreet now.
- Okay, okay.

730
01:18:55,032 --> 01:18:57,805
- The storm's front got everything tied-up.
- What's goin' on?

731
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:02,167
- The road's blocked 'til the storm's over.
- I've got to be in Salt Lake tomorrow!

732
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:06,056
- I guess you just gotta find another way to go.
- Damn!

733
01:19:08,386 --> 01:19:09,866
What the hell.

734
01:19:11,049 --> 01:19:12,916
Hey, that's my rig!

735
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:16,014
That's my god damned rig!

736
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,292
David!

737
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:21,692
That's my god damned rig!

738
01:19:24,332 --> 01:19:25,473
<i>What the hell...

739
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,352
That's my damn rig!

740
01:19:30,193 --> 01:19:33,701
- They'll get 'em at the next roadblock.
- Damn!

741
01:19:49,776 --> 01:19:52,939
- Must be on your side.
- Yeah.

742
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:04,678
- You better wait here.
- No, I'm coming with you.

743
01:20:27,252 --> 01:20:29,656
<i>Come in, the door's open.

744
01:20:33,384 --> 01:20:34,926
<i>Drop it over there by the fireplace.

745
01:20:36,074 --> 01:20:37,507
Oh, I thought you were from the Base.

746
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:40,331
- Dr. Longstreet here?
- No, can you help you?

747
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,416
This is the town! This is place
in the <i>desert I was telling you about.</i>

748
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:47,260
<i>This is close to where
Jimmy and I first showed up.

749
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,042
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to leave.

750
01:20:49,066 --> 01:20:50,624
- Where is Longstreet?
- This is a private residence!

751

We're not leavin' 'til we see him.

752
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:02,065
Be careful of that, it's loaded!

753
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:04,468
- Where is he?
- He's on the base.

754
01:21:04,505 --> 01:21:07,645
- Take me to him.
- It's a secured area, they'll never let you in.

755
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:09,797
We'll see about that!

756
01:21:27,418 --> 01:21:29,106
- All right, get down.
- You're never gonna make it.

757
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:31,153
Shut up and get down!

758
01:21:33,772 --> 01:21:36,374
Halt! Halt!

759
01:21:42,307 --> 01:21:45,226
<i>Attention all security personnel breach at gate!

760
01:21:45,227 --> 01:21:48,058
- All right, where is he?
- The control room.

761
01:21:48,059 --> 01:21:50,602
<i>Unauthorized vehicle approaching control area.

762

763
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,472

01:22:08,043 --> 01:22:09,393
Let's go! C'mon, get out!

765
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:16,580
- Come on! Let's go!
- We're not gonna god damned make it!

766
01:22:22,529 --> 01:22:23,814
David!

767
01:22:24,352 --> 01:22:27,585
You all right? C'mon, c'mon, move it! Let's go!

768
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,657
There'll be a guard.

769
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:02,152
- Why don't you just let me talk to him.
- Shut up!

770
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:13,318
- That's it, sailor.
- I'll blow his head off.

771
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:15,673
At this point, you'll have to chance that.

772
01:23:15,947 --> 01:23:18,597
- Put the gun down.
<i>- All right, Major.</i>

773
01:23:18,634 --> 01:23:20,312
Don't hurt him.

774
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,493
Let him through.

775
01:23:37,218 --> 01:23:39,347
What the hell have you done, Longstreet?

776
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:46,370
Replay the probe.

777
01:23:55,883 --> 01:24:02,025
Recognize 'em? Your ship and
our town... trapped together?

778
01:24:02,702 --> 01:24:05,325
- How did it happen?
- We don't know exactly.

779
01:24:05,361 --> 01:24:11,124
But somehow the electromagnetic fields created
in two experiments, one in 1943 and the other now...

780
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:18,075
cross-connected, they created a vortex, a hole in
the space-time continuum, and you fell through it.

781
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:21,013
What the hell are you talking about?

782
01:24:21,326 --> 01:24:25,267
In 1943, when the Eldridge
came back, the hole closed behind it.

783
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:30,904
This time it stayed open... it's like... it's like
a giant vacuum, sucking everything into it.

784
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:34,185
Now, we can't stop it, but I believe that you can.

785
01:24:34,221 --> 01:24:36,750
- How?
- Don't listen to him, David.

786
01:24:38,815 --> 01:24:43,546
The source of energy explosion in the vortex
is the generators on the Eldridge.

787
01:24:44,203 --> 01:24:46,760
You have to go back
and shut them down, David.

788
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:50,706
- I'm not doin' anything for you.
- I'm afraid you've no alternative.

789
01:24:51,398 --> 01:24:54,453
You see, in the very real sense,
you've already done it.

790
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:58,177
You see, when I interviewed the survivors
of the Eldridge, they told me that

791
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:00,056
you were the one that
shut down the generators.

792
01:25:00,074 --> 01:25:03,100
- But I didn't.
- Not yet.

793
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:05,793
But we know that eventually you will.

794
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:10,765
You're still multiply-connected, David.
Your hand.

795
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:16,838
The molecules still drift. As long as that
hole stays open, you'll continue to deteriorate,

796
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:24,198
until you return to 1943,
same as your friend, Parker.

797
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:27,082
He's lying, David, don't listen
to anything he says.

798
01:25:27,143 --> 01:25:31,298
- I wish to God I were.
- Leave him alone, just leave him alone.

799
01:25:32,523 --> 01:25:34,209
He's right, Allison.

800
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:39,240
I can feel it.

801
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:43,689
What am I to say to you, David, "I'm sorry."?

802
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:48,419
I've lived with this thing for 40 years,
there's not a day I didn't feel it.

803
01:25:48,728 --> 01:25:52,423
What of all this? A new experiment? You did it again!

804
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:57,224
Yes... yes.

805
01:26:07,664 --> 01:26:11,824
The copper coils in the suit should
protect from the electromagnetic forces.

806
01:26:11,836 --> 01:26:13,691
- What is he doing?
- It's oxygen.

807
01:26:13,734 --> 01:26:15,409
<i>Is any of this stuff really gonna help me?

808
01:26:15,445 --> 01:26:21,082
Well, if it doesn't help, it won't matter,
'cause nothing's going to be left here anyway.

809
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:29,863
- Can you give me a couple of minutes?
- That's about all you got.

810
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,722
I can't believe it's gonna end like this.

811
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,953
I can't believe it!

812
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:48,016
What's gonna happen?

813
01:26:49,853 --> 01:26:52,474
I don't know, nobody knows.

814
01:26:59,718 --> 01:27:02,818
Shoot! Maybe in 40 years I'll...

815
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,075
come back and surprise you again.

816

<i>All non-essential personnel are to evacuate

817

818
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:39,053

- We're ready, communications are in.

820

<i>Just hope it's all working.

821
01:27:47,975 --> 01:27:50,571

when you entry the vortex.

822
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:54,248
- We won't be able to help ya.
- Am I supposed to drive this?

823
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:55,821
- No.
- I am.

824
01:27:58,383 --> 01:27:59,987
Let's go, son.

825
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:56,757
- So, what did you think of 1984?
- Television's great.

826
01:28:57,589 --> 01:29:03,075
- You didn't see enough of it.
- I didn't see enough of anything.
