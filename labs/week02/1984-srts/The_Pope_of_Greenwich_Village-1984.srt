1
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,799
The summer wind

2
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,301
Came blowing in

3
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:40,013
From across the sea

4
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,893
It lingered there

5
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,938
To touch your hair

6
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,899
And walk with me

7
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,195
All summer long

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,739
We sang a song

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,911
And then we strolled that golden sand

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,000
Two sweethearts

11
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,357
And the summer wind

12
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,468
Like painted kites

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,762
Those days and nights

14
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,016
They went flying by

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,855
The world was new

16
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:35,819
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

17
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:43,243
Then softer than a piper man

18
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:47,873
One day it called to you

19
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,337
I lost you

20
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,299
I lost you to the summer wind

21
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,055
The autumn wind

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,432
And the winter winds

23
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,893
They have come and gone

24
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,024
And still the days

25
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,152
Those lonely days they go...

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,197
Hi, Charlie. It's 3:30.

27
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,742
I'm taking Beth's 4:00 class
'cause she's got an audition.

28
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,702
Sorry I won't be able
to make your dinner.

29
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,330
Hey, do me a favor, don't cook.

30
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,623
- Jesus.
- Be good.

31
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,709
That never end

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,799
My fickle friend

33
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:47,266
The summer wind

34
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,729
Warm summer wind

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,614
Where the hell you been? Frankie.

36
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,042
How come nobody keeps me waiting
when they're looking to borrow it?

37
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,212
- You don't want it? You don't want it?
- Gimme the money. Gimme the money.

38
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,468
- We gotta stop meeting like this.
- Gimme the money!

39
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,724
Yeah, grazie.

40
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,477
- Ronnie, I'm sorry.
- Paulie came in late, too.

41
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,439
- Paulie came in late?
- So I been working short a waiter.

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,150
Charlie, he's your cousin,
but the kid pushes it to the hilt.

43
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,943
Hey, tell me about it.

44
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,070
I been on the phone
with reservations half the day.

45
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,407
Christ, don't people know
how bad the food is here?

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,618
Ladies' room toilet
overflowed during lunch.

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,373
To top it off, the old man's upstairs.
He's got a bug up his ass this big.

48
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,126
- Claims he's being robbed blind.
- What else is new?

49
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,338
He's not bullshitting, Charlie.
He's checking the waiters' dupes.

50
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,591
He's checking the dupes tonight?
You tell Paulie?

51
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,427
I already told Paulie.
The party is over for a while.

52
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,430
And you're the guy on the line with him.

53
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,352
Has Nicky been in yet?

54
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,437
He's late,
like everybody else around here.

55
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,607
Oh, and the machine's been
out of Marlboros for a week now.

56
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,360
And J3 on the jukebox sticks.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,077
Charlie, this bimbo broad
you're getting started with,

58
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,662
this is Johnny Mack's private stock.

59
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,124
Who's getting started?
Huh? What am I doing?

60
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,045
What did I do?

61
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,020
Is Paulie here?

62
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,202
Will you give me a break,
for Christ's sake?

63
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,162
I'm coming, I'm coming.

64
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,956
Hey, Paulie, now. Come on.

65
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,249
You got it.

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,838
That's good, Charlie.

67
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,007
The house had some nice week here.

68
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,845
$195. What do you want for yourself?

69
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,932
- Let me grab 15 for cab fare.
- You got it.

70
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,476
Paulie make his payment?

71
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,770
Paulie who?

72
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,732
Anything I can get for you?
My name is Paulie.

73
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,694
If you need anything,
you will call me, yes? Absolutely.

74
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,779
Hey, Frankie, what number came in today?

75
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,614
Brooklyn number? 417.

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,492
- What'd you have? 325?
- No, I had 417.

77
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,870
- Not with me, you didn't.
- 325.

78
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,330
- You got it.
- Billy.

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,170
Walter, any time on table six.

80
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,095
You okay with your Shylocks out there?
I got a few, if you need it, man.

81
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,890
Ronnie warn you about the old man?
Paulie, it's serious.

82
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,521
Cut that out, you Argentine degenerate.
That's my cousin's ass you're rubbing.

83
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,981
That's family.

84
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,150
This ain't some filthy little jail
in Caracas.

85
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,402
It's Amer-ii-ca!

86
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,657
Where the hell are my clams?

87
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,619
We get some fucking plates?! Come on!

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,628
Keep quiet. Shut up. Just eat, huh?

89
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,172
Patty, enjoy the scarol'. Vito, dig in.

90
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,050
Everything is taken care of.
Alla salute.

91
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,220
- Salut'.
- Salut'.

92
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,682
You like the steak?

93
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,938
Who's got the big table?

94
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,066
- Maybe Paulie.
- Maybe Paulie.

95
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,197
- Walter's half whacked.
- Walter the cook?

96
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,492
Walter the cook.
You know another Walter in the place?

97
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,619
Somebody's been feeding him vodka.

98
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,454
Hey, now what's wrong with this, Paulie?

99
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,998
He ordered Beefeater. Says it ain't.

100
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,168
Nobody would do that, Charlie.
Who'd give that boozer a drink?

101
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,965
All the waiters know better. Of course,
I can't vouch for the busboys.

102
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,217
The big party on table eight?

103
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,679
- Let me see the check.
- I got their ticket, man.

104
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,472
- Let me see the check.
- What for?

105
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,599
'Cause you're running a contract
at that table, that's what for,

106
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,268
and half the dishes aren't on the check.

107
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,895
No? We'll borrow
a thousand apiece from Frankie Shy

108
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,188
and bet it on the check.

109
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,732
If you got more than six entrees
on it, you win.

110
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,528
I count, uh... I count 12 entrees...

111
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,822
I count 12 entrees on that table,
three of them steaks.

112
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,949
Paulie, I'll go you double or nothing

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,326
whether you got a single fucking
steak on that check.

114
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,745
Careful on that double
or nothing, Charlie.

115
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,831
You'll lose your ass on that bet.

116
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,208
Gimme the book.

117
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,044
Hey, Charlie, you were in.
Hey, man, I'm serious.

118
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,088
You were in for a ten-spot.
Serious, you were in...

119
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,132
Six entrees. Six entrees, huh?

120
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,509
- You're a greedy bastard, know that?
- Charlie...

121
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,845
You're a greedy bastard.

122
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,389
I had you figured for a sawbuck.

123
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,765
You had me figured for a sawbuck.

124
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,809
For what, to tide me over
when the old man fires me?

125
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,770
Relax. That old asshole
won't know a thing.

126
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,274
Plus you're feeding the cook vodka
to get your food out without dupes.

127
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,861
Another hour, he's gonna go face-ass
down into a bowl of scaloppini.

128
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,197
I'm gonna have to go behind
the range, blow another $80 shirt.

129
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,951
I mean, at least that oughta be enough
so you stop screwing me.

130
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,162
Screwing you?

131
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,876
I wasn't screwing you, Charlie.
I had you figured for a sawbuck.

132
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,129
Hey, I don't want a sawbuck, all right?
I want my job.

133
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,007
Cousin or no cousin,
that's the last check you rob, capisce?

134
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,259
- Capisce. I understand.
- You understand me? I'm serious now.

135
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,553
Do you understand me? I'm serious now.

136
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,806
- Fix your tie.
- What?

137
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,226
Fix your tie.
You're such a fucking slob.

138
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,772
- This good?
- Go.

139
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,735
Do you have my charge tips?

140
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,695
No, I'm not done yet, Waldo.

141
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,365
Mr. Owner would like to see you
after you check out.

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,126
And you, you little prick...

143
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,832
You stole my clams.

144
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,671
Hey, Paulie, don't play with him.

145
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,766
We're not getting rich
in this place, Charlie.

146
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,396
You'll never get your own
joint like this, never.

147
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,947
I mean it, man.
We're breaking our ass for nickels...

148
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,866
Hey, Paulie, will you give me a break
and let me check out, please?

149
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,079
Good night, Charles.

150
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,457
Charles?

151
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,379
Charles.

152
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,553
- I'm out. I'm on the street.
- He fired you?

153
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,680
No, he fired us.
They nailed you on that big check.

154
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,434
He should die.
Die! Die, you old bastard!

155
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,520
No, you're the one that should die.
Ronnie told you it was my job.

156
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,939
Charlie. Hey, man.

157
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,316
Hey, man, don't blame me for what
that old bastard done to you.

158
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,068
He fired you, man, him!

159
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,862
- Hey, let me out of here, all right?
- Charlie!

160
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,447
We were starving in that shithouse.

161
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,574
Hey, why don't you grow up,
for Christ's sakes, huh?

162
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,617
Why don't you just fucking grow up?

163
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,619
- Charlie.
- Charlie. What?

164
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,915
We were like a couple of victims in
there. You know, we could do better.

165
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,670
We could do a thousand percent better.
Hey, man, don't think so small.

166
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,631
For once in your life,
don't worry about a lousy job, okay?

167
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,592
Don't worry about a job?
Don't worry about...

168
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,177
What the fuck should I worry about, huh?

169
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,221
I owe six different department stores,
I got two Shylocks I gotta feed...

170
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,891
I got Shylocks, too.
You ain't alone here.

171
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,018
And those other assholes, the stores?

172
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,438
You got no job now.
They can't collect no money off you.

173
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,482
Why can't you just admit
you was wrong, huh?

174
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,817
Why can't you just say,
"Charlie, I was wrong"?

175
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,903
- Wrong?
- Yeah, wrong.

176
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,113
Where was I wrong?

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,657
What did you say?

178
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,243
- I said where was I wrong?
- Where was you wrong?

179
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,164
Ronnie told you not to rob.
You robbed. That got me fired.

180
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,083
You was wrong. You understand that?
You were wrong. You understand that?

181
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,960
- I didn't figure I'd get caught.
- You didn't figure...

182
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,464
Look, man, if I figured I'd get caught,
I'd be a thousand percent wrong.

183
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,760
But if I didn't figure I'd get caught,
then I wasn't jeopardizing your job.

184
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,595
Hey, don't you understand, Charlie...

185
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,850
- Hey!
- Keep your hands off me.

186
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,354
- Look what you did to my suit.
- I'm sorry.

187
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,314
What do you need
a fancy suit for, Charlie?

188
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,650
You got no job to wear it to, man.

189
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,944
- What did you say?
- Come on.

190
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,238
Huh? Say that again.

191
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,657
Say it again. Say it again.

192
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,785
Say... say what you just said again.

193
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,663
About my suit.
Say... say... what do I don't need?

194
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,456
Tell me what I don't need.

195
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,167
What do you need
a fancy suit for, Charlie?

196
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,753
You got no job to wear it to, man.

197
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,674
That's right.

198
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,008
Why?

199
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,472
Here's your button.

200
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,683
Come on, man.

201
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,061
Hey, man, let's go watch the sun
come up like the old days.

202
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,605
Hey, Charluccio!

203
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,401
We'll sit and have a couple
of cognacs like gentlemen!

204
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,281
Hey, let me tell you something.

205
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,952
I don't have time to sit
and watch the sun come up.

206
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,080
Capisce? I don't have time.

207
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,231
I could teach another aerobics class.

208
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,152
There's some models
trying out for a commercial.

209
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,488
It would mean a few
extra dollars next week.

210
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,577
Great. Oh, Wallach's wants 300.

211
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,288
Or they're gonna give it
to a collection agency.

212
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,335
We can cut back a little, too.
We eat out a lot more than we have to.

213
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,048
- You gonna cook?
- I can cook.

214
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,009
You can cook. You can't cook.

215
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,187
I don't fucking believe this.
I don't... I don't believe this.

216
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,565
She's got 11 months'
worth of parking tickets here.

217
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,234
- The fucking bitch.
- Who?

218
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,072
Who? Cooky. Who else? Cooky.
She's still got the Buick in my name.

219
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,282
God damn it.

220
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,369
Let her pay them. It's only fair.

221
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,165
How can you say "Let her pay"?
Every penny that she gets comes from me.

222
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,794
Jesus Christ! It's almost two grand.

223
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,713
She must be parking
on the fucking sidewalk.

224
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,092
- Take the car back.
- Take the car back.

225
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,718
She got three brothers
who belong in a zoo.

226
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,720
I take the car back,
they'll start a war over that thing.

227
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,598
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'll manage.

228
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,976
So what are you talking about then?

229
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,229
Why you being such a cooze, huh?

230
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,237
Was that an accident?

231
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,656
Huh? Was that an accident?

232
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,701
- I don't think so.
- Jesus Christ.

233
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,205
Why did you do that?

234
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,258
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,137
You can hit.

236
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,350
Finding a job will pick you up.

237
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,061
You'll get your reflexes back.

238
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,810
I think I already got my reflexes back.

239
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,373
The summer wind

240
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,043
Came blowing in

241
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,879
From across the sea

242
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,134
It lingered there

243
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,095
To touch your hair

244
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,432
And walk with me

245
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,686
All summer long

246
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,189
We sang a song

247
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:12,570
And then we strolled that golden sand

248
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,949
Two sweethearts

249
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,870
And the summer wind

250
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,501
Like painted kites

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,920
Those days and nights

252
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,006
They went flying by

253
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,054
The world was new

254
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:43,976
Beneath a blue umbrella sky...

255
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,229
Hey, Charlie Moran.
How the hell are you, huh?

256
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,190
- How you doing?
- What's happening, baby?

257
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,778
- I'm not doing any good in there.
- You know anybody who does?

258
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,198
- So what's happening? How's Cooky?
- Cooky's history.

259
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,743
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry.

260
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,371
So, what's happening with you?
What are you doing?

261
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,873
- Waiting.
- You're waiting? For what?

262
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,583
Work.

263
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,335
Charlie, I'm not gonna
bullshit with you now.

264
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,422
I swear to God, business is off with me.
I'm down 35% on my dinners.

265
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,883
You're up against a wall,
you come in by me,

266
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,885
I put you out on the floor
a couple of shifts a week.

267
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,054
You work as a waiter, okay?

268
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,848
- Work as a waiter?
- Yeah.

269
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,184
- I look like a waiter to you, huh?
- No. I'm offering you a job.

270
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,603
- You want to put me on as a waiter?
- Gonna get mad at me over this?

271
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,564
- I offer you a job...
- I wouldn't work in your restaurant...

272
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,524
- Do me a favor. Go fuck yourself, okay?
- Hey.

273
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,029
Fucking creep, you!

274
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,953
Maybe you should take a waiter's job
until something better opens up.

275
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,830
Diane, give me a break, huh?

276
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,125
Just a thought.

277
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,711
What do you want me to do,
you want me to save up

278
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,171
my little tip cup every night?

279
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,090
In 20 years, maybe I'll have
enough to own a place?

280
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,134
It's honest work, Charlie.

281
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,555
Something I learned a long time ago
about honest work.

282
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,225
When people tell you they got
honest work for you, know what they got?

283
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,561
- What?
- A shit job. That's what they got.

284
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,105
Do you ever think
we don't have to own the restaurant

285
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,648
to move to the country, Charlie?

286
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,943
You could find a job managing a place.
I could get work.

287
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,155
Diane, I'm not gonna head up to Maine,
you know, start chopping wood.

288
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,117
When we leave the city,
I'm gonna leave as an owner.

289
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,161
How are you gonna see your son
when you leave?

290
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,664
- You think about it?
- I'll work it out.

291
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,250
What's the sudden interest in my kid?

292
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,212
It's not sudden.

293
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,006
I'm curious.

294
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,050
Doesn't it bother you
to only see Vinnie once a week?

295
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,260
Yeah, it bothers me. Yeah.

296
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,804
It bothers me.

297
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,849
When Cooky and I first split up,
I used to see the kid every other day.

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,852
I used to take him to the zoo.
I took him to the ferry.

299
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,188
I dropped money
at every Carvel stand in the city.

300
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,814
- And?
- And what?

301
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,902
Then Cooky and her scumbag brothers
used to knock me down all week long.

302
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,820
Bang, bang, bang. No mercy.

303
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,405
So by the time I got the kid,

304
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,784
I got nothing but tight lips
and a frown all day.

305
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,207
It might be different if it was our kid.

306
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,758
Not at this point in my life.
I mean, you know.

307
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,970
You know, maybe down the road sometime.

308
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,721
But not right now.

309
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,684
Why not right now?

310
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,271
Because I got my back
against the wall right now, that's why.

311
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,855
I got no job right now.

312
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,482
You want me to put it
a different way for you?

313
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,318
I'm outta work right now.
I got no money, capisce?

314
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,363
I got two Shylocks
I gotta carry on my back.

315
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,991
I got a marshal who wants
to put a lien on my salary

316
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,243
when and if I get a salary, all right?

317
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,329
I got an ex-wife and I got a kid
I gotta feed every week.

318
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,582
Listen to you, Charlie.
You're always saying "I." "I got two..."

319
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, Diane!
Don't play games with me, all right?

320
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,338
- I'm not playing games with you.
- What do you wanna do, you wanna fight?

321
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,509
- Shut up, damn it! Fuck off! Piss off!
- Hey! What do you wanna do?

322
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,971
Look, I'm going to go bang
around the Village for a while, right?

323
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,559
I need a dose of sanity in my life.
Yeah, hey.

324
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,854
Charlie?

325
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,065
- Charlie!
- What? What do you want?

326
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,402
What do you want?
What? What do you want?

327
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,031
What? What do you want?
Speak. What do you want?

328
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,409
- I'm pregnant.
- Come over here.

329
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,912
Come over here. Come over here.

330
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:38,044
Come over here.
Come over here right now.

331
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,880
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't come over here.

332
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,798
Don't come over here.

333
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,315
Grandpa used to have hundreds of birds

334
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,192
he used to keep up here on the roof.

335
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:06,113
He had all different kinds.
He had tipplets. He had flights.

336
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,909
He had tumblers. He had nuns.
You know what nuns are?

337
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,203
They're pigeons.

338
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,789
One of the most beautiful flocks
in the whole Village

339
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,957
was up here in this coop.

340
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,126
They used to have pigeon wars
over these birds.

341
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,920
Grandpa used to stand up here
with a stick.

342
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,464
He used to go like this.
He used to bring all the birds home.

343
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,342
Hey, Vinnie,
most of your grandfather's time up here

344
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,595
was spent cleaning up bird shit, it was.

345
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,773
Hey, Vinnie,
tell your old man to listen.

346
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,401
Cousin Paulie's got something cooking.

347
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,028
He's gonna thank me for getting us out
of that sentence

348
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,738
we were serving at Sal's.

349
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,199
- Hey, I wanna find my own job alone.
- Job?

350
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,870
Job? Who's talking about a job?
I'm talking about a move, man.

351
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,122
I'll pass.

352
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,791
How can he pass on something
he don't even hear, Vinnie?

353
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,252
I don't know.

354
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,630
This is a score, man. Nice and easy.

355
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,801
And the guy I'm in with is a pro,
Charlie. An absolute pro, man.

356
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:13,764
Yeah? Well, you're an amateur, like me.
We're not professional thieves, Paulie.

357
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,521
Where you been?
I'm waiting a God damn an hour.

358
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,857
- I gotta go shopping.
- Cooky, don't bust my balls, all right?

359
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,609
Come on, honey.

360
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,028
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, Dad.

361
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,534
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
- Come on, honey.

362
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,504
She'll have you paying taxes
if you're not careful, man.

363
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,508
They're all the same.
They like you to think small, you know?

364
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,053
Paulie, a couple of weeks out of work,
you're gonna start thinking small, too.

365
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:58,267
Tips, pay, plus what you robbed,
you were bringing home 600 a week.

366
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,646
Where you gonna find that, huh?
Where you gonna find that, huh?

367
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,982
You take a girl out, you drop 100 bucks.

368
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:09,111
Hey, more than 100, Charlie.
I mean, I like to look good, you know?

369
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,239
Lobsters, some wine,
a couple of sambucas, you know?

370
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,284
When I drop 100 on my night off,
I figure I got away cheap,

371
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,660
you know, like I robbed 50.

372
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,580
Soon money ain't gonna be
no problem, Charlie.

373
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,792
- I got something big going for me, man.
- Oh, yeah? What?

374
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,545
I own a piece of a thoroughbred.

375
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,173
- A what?
- A thoroughbred.

376
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,426
A fucking racehorse, Charlie.

377
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,304
I'm in with Tommy Botondo
and Jimmy the Cheese Man.

378
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,432
Five thou apiece we went for.

379
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,061
- Where did you get 5,000?
- I went on the street for it.

380
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,312
- On the street?
- Yeah.

381
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,106
- What are you, stunat?
- Hey, man, we got a score set up.

382
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,692
If you would listen,
money ain't gonna be no problem.

383
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,321
Paulie, what do you or Jimmy
the Cheese Man know about horses?

384
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,573
I don't have to know nothing
in this deal.

385
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,742
I got in on a swindle with this horse.

386
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,454
This horse's father won
the Belmont Stakes, man.

387
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,917
Any horse wins the Belmont Stakes,
the yearlings go for maybe 600 big ones.

388
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,420
That's exactly it.
We got her for 15 grand, man.

389
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,465
It was like shoplifting,
buying this horse.

390
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,760
Have you ever heard
of artificial inspiration?

391
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,680
It don't just work with people, Charlie.

392
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,059
See, horses can have babies
by artificial inspiration, too, man.

393
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,937
Like, let's say you got
a couple of horses

394
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,190
worth... a million dollars apiece.

395
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,151
You don't wanna set 'em loose
in some field to screw.

396
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,947
I mean, how many times you yourself
pull a muscle or something screwing?

397
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,866
And these great big stallions,
man, they get horny,

398
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,536
they could easily kick
the mother horse in the head.

399
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:44,373
- Ba-boom. You're out a million dollars.
- So what's the point?

400
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,125
- Point?
- Yeah, what's the point?

401
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:51,005
Jimmy the Cheese Man got in
with the groom of this champion horse.

402
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,009
We got some of this champion's jism.

403
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,595
The groom jerked the horse off.

404
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,556
He beat his meat right in the stable.

405
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,517
Well, my horse's mother got some of it.

406
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,020
You bet horses.
You know what that means.

407
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:11,066
Her first race, Starry Hope
goes off at big, big odds, man.

408
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,486
Her papers say her father
was some no-dick piece of garbage,

409
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,906
but she got the champion gene, Charlie.

410
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,369
- Champion gene?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Horses ain't like people, man.

412
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,708
They can't make themselves better
than they're born.

413
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,420
See, with a horse, it's all in the gene.

414
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,798
It's the fucking gene
that does the running.

415
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,468
The horse got absolutely nothing
to do with it.

416
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,637
Let me ask you something.

417
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,264
I mean, how the hell are you
gonna make your Shylock payments?

418
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,392
- Now, especially?
- Exactly like I told you, man.

419
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,605
With the nicest,
easiest score you ever heard of.

420
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,232
Charlie, at least meet the guy, okay?

421
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,318
You got nothing to lose
by looking it over.

422
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,530
There's a real deadline on this,
Charlucc'.

423
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:03,786
Starry Hope runs in a couple of weeks,
and I need big bucks to bet with, man.

424
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,456
There's real money to be made
on that race, you know?

425
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,046
You know, you ought to get a permit.

426
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,006
A permit? For what?

427
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,718
To shit in the street.
You look like a horse.

428
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,904
Paulie,
are you sure this guy is all right?

429
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,770
That's Barney.

430
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,522
What are you doing?

431
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,317
I fix clocks here in the Bronx.

432
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,446
Antique dealers downtown feed me work.

433
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,781
Chimes, mostly.

434
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,409
You can make a good living in this city
doing nothing but chimes.

435
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,660
Chimes, man.

436
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,662
Yeah, chimes. I get it.

437
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,625
Can you still open safes?

438
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,085
Some.

439
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,380
The kind we'll run into
on this job I can get into.

440
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,216
Yeah? What kind can't you get into?

441
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,054
- What kind?
- Yeah.

442
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,058
Banks. Big jewelry houses.

443
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,936
Anything wired up to Holmes.

444
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,981
I'm not a big-time safecracker.

445
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,900
I'm a hotshot locksmith.

446
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,611
People got a half million to protect,

447
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,322
they buy the kind of box
I don't know how to get into.

448
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,035
- Are you sure about opening this one?
- If it ain't wired, I can get into it.

449
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,456
- Your buddy boy says it ain't wired.
- Guaranteed. I seen it, man.

450
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,877
You done any time, Barney?

451
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,882
Goes back to '47.

452
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,551
I did a pound at Green Haven.

453
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,931
Hey, what the fuck is this, huh?
What the fuck is this?

454
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,394
We giving lifetime references here?
I did five years in the joint.

455
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,064
Five years. End of story, huh?

456
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,775
'47, Charlie.

457
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,195
Either of you guys have
an automobile out there?

458
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,823
- Yeah.
- Better hurry.

459
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,742
The summons man is blitzing the street
with his little fleet of tow trucks.

460
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,161
Tow trucks! Shit!

461
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,292
He's the only police officer in this
city that sets the hook himself.

462
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,672
Hey! It's my car. It's my car.

463
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,717
- Hey, I'll move it, Officer.
- Lift her.

464
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,636
Hey! That ain't right,
and you know it, man!

465
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:13,976
Hey, Officer, I get here before you
hook me, you're supposed to let me go.

466
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,937
I still gotta take a ticket,
but you're not supposed to tow me.

467
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,522
Take it away!

468
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,990
Cocksucker.

469
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,003
That rat bastard
was supposed to let me go.

470
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,046
He doesn't let anyone go.

471
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,757
He hooked Monsignor Ryan's
Coupe de Ville last Saturday

472
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,218
while the Monsignor was in saying
the 8:00 mass.

473
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,553
The man is possessed.

474
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,764
He should die of hemorrhoids.

475
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,602
It's gonna cost you $100 for the tow,
plus $25 for the ticket.

476
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,105
And that fat bastard comes in here
every afternoon like clockwork

477
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,692
to piss in my toilet
and drink my whisky free.

478
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,325
He knows there's two
first-class locks on that building.

479
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,118
Take me an hour to go through them.

480
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,455
The other one,
I go through with a toothpick.

481
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,083
Crossing that alley to the other roof
is a piece of cake.

482
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,212
We go inside, I open the safe
and we find peanuts in there,

483
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,756
I'm gonna want your ass, Paulie.

484
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,176
Charlie, this is A1,
guaran-fucking-teed, man.

485
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,303
Go ahead and sleep on it.

486
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,723
Paulie, before I go to sleep on it,
just how sure are you of the 50 thou?

487
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,517
They deliver to some kind
of small chemical plant, COD.

488
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,521
Payment in green.
And there's 15 trucks out there.

489
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,815
- And it all goes in the safe?
- Every penny.

490
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,527
They get back too late for the banks.
Friday's receipts sit over the weekend.

491
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,614
Charlie, we've been through this
again and again.

492
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,159
What is he, stunat'?

493
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,662
What do you mean?

494
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,288
He's like a wackadoo.

495
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,832
Noodles and an egg roll. How much?

496
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,168
Hey, what's the matter with you, Barney?

497
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,754
Hey, man,
you'll die if you eat that shit.

498
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,256
This guy is selling
instant hepatitis here.

499
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,384
It ain't nothing but warm germs
going here.

500
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,929
Charlie, we're gonna
lose our partner here, man.

501
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,891
This upazz' bought a horse.

502
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,310
What's your story?

503
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,523
Come here, Charlie.

504
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:32,864
With these eyes, four more years,
they're gonna tell me to buy a shepherd.

505
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,574
I'm 58.

506
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,161
I got a 25-year-old retarded kid
my wife won't let go of.

507
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:43,166
I've a two-family house,
a little left on the mortgage.

508
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,712
I might see some extra bucks every month
if the neighborhood don't go colored.

509
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,463
Colored, man.

510
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,551
I need one nice score now so the kid's
got something going for him.

511
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,053
- One nice score.
- Right.

512
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,513
Absolutely.

513
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,436
Hey, Paulie, where the hell you
gonna keep that horse you bought?

514
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,148
- I thought you live on Carmine Street.
- At the racetrack, for Christ's sake.

515
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,652
It ain't a fucking pet, Barney.
It's a racehorse, okay? Huh.

516
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,198
Hey, either one of you do any time?

517
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,034
- What, are you nuts?!
- Hey, Barney, whoa.

518
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,703
Do I look like I could afford
to do any time?

519
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,204
I'm no tough guy.

520
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,123
They send me upstate,
some big militant begunda's

521
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,709
gonna grab me in the shower
and "ram it up yo' ass!"

522
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,295
- Fuck that shit.
- It's no joke.

523
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,547
All this talk about doing time
makes me nervous.

524
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,760
Are you in, Charlie, or what?

525
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,348
Is there gonna be money in that safe?

526
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,810
Yes, man. For the tenth time, yes.

527
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,187
Barney, don't eat this shit.
Give me this.

528
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,191
- Hey, come on. Stop. What the fuck?
- It ain't good for you, Barney.

529
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,193
I paid two bucks for it!
Gimme the two bucks!

530
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,624
- Hey, Bunky.
- Hey, Nunzi.

531
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,585
Who's the guys?

532
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,422
The Chinks? They're okay.
They're with Eddie.

533
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,468
- How's the calamari?
- Mm.

534
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:25,185
Hey, Bunky, the fight next week,
you still got a hook-up for tickets?

535
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,895
Yeah, but let me know how many.

536
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,563
Tomorrow, I'll give you a call.

537
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,026
Will you give me a break
with that smoke?

538
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,702
What's the matter? No scungilli tonight?

539
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,913
My stomach's a little sour.

540
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,415
I wanna eat bland for a while.

541
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,671
You could have a wire that big
underneath all that sauce.

542
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,632
You're the cop.
You're supposed to be wired, not me.

543
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,760
No more, Eddie.
Don't you read the newspapers?

544
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,847
All the cops are getting pinched now.

545
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,100
Wise guys, they're too busy testifying.

546
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,434
You're right.

547
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,271
Yeah, everything
is upside down out there.

548
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,273
The whole world is upside down.

549
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,444
Listen, uh...

550
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,239
I hear you're having a little trouble
with Carlucci.

551
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,617
Put something in your mouth, Bunky.

552
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,328
It's good.

553
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,800
The brass, they're getting
a little nervous, you understand?

554
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,388
We're sweetening up the pot this month.

555
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,807
You keep everybody calm.

556
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,351
There'll be 150 large there.

557
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,188
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

558
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,566
That's all that counts. No?

559
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,026
You're right.

560
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,196
I remember you. You're the guy...

561
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,365
Yeah, I'm the guy
who got his car fucking towed.

562
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,116
- And you're Jinty, right?
- Ginty.

563
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,577
- That's what I said.
- What the hell are you doing?

564
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,414
Don't worry about it, Gint. Here.

565
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,416
Put that in your cup.

566
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,419
Please God,
you're not poisoning the man, are you?

567
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,921
It ain't poison.

568
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,299
It's horse physic.
Hey, pour the ginger ale, man.

569
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,511
It's what they give horses
when they can't shit.

570
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,054
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

571
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,348
How many of those little envelopes
do they give to a horse that can't shit?

572
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:13,478
One. One envelope will bust
a block of concrete, man.

573
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,689
Take a long time to work?

574
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,190
It ain't slow.

575
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,251
Encore.

576
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,770
Yeah. 1013.

577
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,773
Uh, Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue.

578
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,819
There's an officer down.
Officer needs assistance here.

579
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,114
Hurry, man, hurry. Yeah.

580
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,410
Cop shit in his pants!

581
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,997
Cop shit his pants! Shit his pants!

582
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,583
Whoo! Yeah!

583
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,627
Cop shit his pants!

584
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,217
Cop shit his pants! Cop shit his pants!

585
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,639
He's a cop. He's a cop.
He's a cop. He shit his pants.

586
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,141
The cop shit his pants!

587
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,418
It's nice.

588
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,295
It's slightly run-down
and needs a little paint.

589
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,725
It's nice.

590
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,021
It's old. I like that.

591
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,570
- Hello. How are you?
- I'll be with you in a moment.

592
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,952
Needs a buffing machine in the kitchen.
That's the first thing I'd do.

593
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,039
You've painted it
and taken care of the silverware.

594
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,460
Now all we need's a way to buy it.

595
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,089
It's still for sale.

596
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,760
Charlie, you've stopped
even looking for a job.

597
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,515
Listen, uh... after next week,
I might make a real score.

598
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,226
I might not need a job.

599
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,022
Is Paulie part of it?

600
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,692
No.

601
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,653
- Really?
- Yeah, Paulie's part of it.

602
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,741
Hi. Uh, I hope you're not here
to see Linwood.

603
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,451
- He's gone for the day.
- He's not here?

604
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,621
No, we just came up to have lunch.

605
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,540
Would you tell Linwood
that we stopped by?

606
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,460
Mm-hm. Beaujolais?

607
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,212
Beaujolais. Beaujolais?

608
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,089
- Yes.
- Beaujolais. A full bottle.

609
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,178
He's just got you fired.

610
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,639
Maybe he's trying to make it up to me.

611
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,228
When are you gonna outgrow him, Charlie?

612
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,438
Outgrow him?

613
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,194
Diane, maybe WASPs outgrow people.

614
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,155
Italians, they outgrow clothes,
not people.

615
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,866
Hey, Nicky tells me you bought a horse.

616
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,576
- Who Nicky?
- Nicky the Nose.

617
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,994
He says you bought a racehorse.

618
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,580
Well, not a whole horse, Pop.
There's three of us.

619
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,084
Now, look, listen, Paulie.
You're 28 years old.

620
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,254
Your mother's not doing you no favor
by bringing manicot' over twice a week

621
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,547
by washing your laundry.

622
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:55,009
I mean, Rockefellers own racehorses.
Big-shot mafiosos own racehorses.

623
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,847
Waiters don't own racehorses, Paulie.
You went on the street for the money?

624
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,684
To Nappy. I took five large off him.

625
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,061
- How much did he bang you for?
- 200 a week in juice.

626
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,188
You got no gripe there,
but what are you gonna do

627
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,898
if you can't make these payments?

628
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,235
Pop, you should see this horse.
She runs in a couple of weeks.

629
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,529
This horse is gonna make money, Pop.

630
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,573
In my bones, I feel it.

631
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,742
Paulie, look, God forbid,
I don't wish you any hard luck,

632
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,494
but listen to me...
I don't think you're gonna see

633
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,080
even a little piece of baccala
for this deal, you know?

634
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,252
Hey, Pop, it's better you don't smoke.

635
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,963
Jesus Christ, I'm surrounded!

636
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,800
You know, Paulie, I should
have been a lot tougher with you.

637
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,639
My brothers whack their kids a lot more.
They're better off.

638
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,600
Nicky the Nose is better off?

639
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,685
He's got a house in Staten Island.

640
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,354
Pop, the Nose is my first cousin,
but he's a total asshole.

641
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,399
Yeah? He trades in an Olds
98 every year.

642
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,152
Pop, the Nose ain't even Napulitan',
for Christ's sake.

643
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,487
It's his mother's side all the way.

644
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,866
Genoese. He don't go for spit.

645
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,119
The Nose shines his own shoes, Pop.
That's no big success.

646
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,912
So what do you call success, huh?

647
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,085
Knowing how to spend it.

648
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,714
I never ordered a brandy
in my life wasn't Cordon Bleu.

649
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,468
I took 500 from Shylocks, Pop,
to see Sinatra at the Garden.

650
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,013
Sat two seats away from Tony Bennett.

651
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,766
That's success, Pop.

652
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,606
Where is this interview
you're going to tonight?

653
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,150
Uh, it's around.

654
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,862
You're not going to an interview.

655
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,073
No.

656
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,535
You don't even bother
to lie to me carefully anymore.

657
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,998
It's an insult to be lied
to so obviously.

658
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,878
Diane, I'll tell you what...
tomorrow I'm gonna turn over a new leaf,

659
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,590
and I promise you,
my lies will be better.

660
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,467
- Okay?
- Okay.

661
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,138
- Come on. Let's dance.
- We can't dance to that.

662
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,766
No, we can dance.
Vinnie, can we have some music?

663
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,701
You got it, Charlie.

664
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,987
It's closing time

665
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,369
In this nowhere cafe

666
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:33,418
There's no way in the world
I'm gonna let that girl

667
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,254
Let her slip away

668
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,547
Don't go.

669
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,175
Don't go where?

670
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,219
Wherever you're going.

671
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,556
How can you tell me not to go
if you don't know where I'm going, huh?

672
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:52,353
It's a mistake, Charlie.
You're making a mistake.

673
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,288
This is it.

674
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,832
What do you guys think?

675
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,085
- What do you think?
- What do you mean, what do we think?

676
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,629
Top floor's a tough spot.

677
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,840
We gotta go by that like cats.

678
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,468
- Cats.
- Wait here.

679
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,907
What do you think, Charlie?

680
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,285
- I think he's a fucking mope.
- Fucking mope.

681
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,789
But he's careful.
You know, he seems to be prepared.

682
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,457
Prepared, yeah.

683
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,508
What do you think?

684
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,510
I think he's prepared. Absolutely.

685
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,386
No, what do you think?

686
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,931
What do I think?
Of what? An alley? Come on.

687
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,565
Okay, let's move it. Come on.

688
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,154
- What is this for? What is this for?
- Don't worry about it.

689
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,449
Make 'em look light and walk
into the place like we own the joint.

690
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,261
What the hell is in these, Barney?

691
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,557
Tools, nice Genoa salami,
a couple of Thermoses of coffee.

692
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,642
- He's got an appetite.
- Come on, Paulie, just walk.

693
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,228
Three hours in there, you'll be starved.

694
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,190
I'm busting my balls, really.
Okay, you take this.

695
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,697
Ma, do I have a clean T-shirt?

696
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,283
Yeah, it's on
the kitchen chair someplace.

697
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,877
You know, uh... Trusty Dream?
It's a four-year-old filly.

698
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,837
No.

699
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,047
She's in the third at Aqueduct.

700
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,426
Six furlongs.
One-eleven in her last time out.

701
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,139
She must be a nice little place bet.

702
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,933
I like this horse.

703
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,312
Want me to put your game show on, Ma?

704
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,230
Nah, leave it alone.

705
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:45,193
I can't even think with those assholes
jumping up and down and screaming.

706
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,119
Do I have a clean handkerchief, Ma?

707
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,455
It's in the drawer.

708
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,459
I like your haircut, sonny.
Glad I talked you into it.

709
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,888
At least go to the filters, huh, Ma?

710
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,976
And those highballs,
they ain't doing you any good either.

711
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,229
A little whisky is good for the system.

712
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,736
And it's not the cigarettes
that give me the heart attack.

713
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,989
It's 37 years...

714
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,408
scrubbing floors on my hands and knees

715
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,120
for those rich sons-of-bitches
on Park Avenue.

716
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:42,124
Do you remember hauling garbage
after dinner every night of your life?

717
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,835
Pulling on dumbwaiter ropes?

718
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,089
I know. Your right arm is bigger.

719
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,841
Yeah, twice as big as my left.

720
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,220
Pulling dumbwaiter ropes
up five-storey buildings.

721
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,690
Look, it'll protect you
from the muggers when I'm gone.

722
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,061
Aw, Ma, one more year.

723
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,982
One more year, Ma,
and I'll have my 20 in,

724
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,192
and we'll head to Phoenix.

725
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,153
Clean air, sunshine.

726
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,115
I'll even teach you
to play a little golf.

727
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,994
With that dumbwaiter arm of yours,
you'll drive the ball a mile.

728
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,455
And what will you do, Walter?

729
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,622
Liquor store.

730
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,423
Big house, hacienda style.

731
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,967
And I'm even gonna
have a little dumbwaiter put in

732
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,885
just to keep that arm of yours in shape.

733
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,556
And all this on a second-class
detective's pension?

734
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,516
I got a little put away, Ma.

735
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:45,604
That what your little recorder's for?
Keep track of your savings?

736
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,905
It's just a little
personal protection, Ma.

737
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,657
In case things go sour.

738
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,202
I mean, this little box...

739
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,165
well, it gives me a hand to play with,
you know what I mean?

740
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:09,253
If things go sour, Walter...

741
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,088
I got nobody left.

742
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,215
I know, Ma.

743
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,305
Oh, get outta here.

744
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,101
Come on. Lock the door, huh?

745
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,895
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

746
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,738
No, no, no. On your stomach.

747
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,240
I look down, I'll freeze here
for a fucking week, man.

748
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,160
Oh.

749
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,371
- Come on.
- I don't work this high without a net.

750
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:48,250
- It's your idea, this whole thing.
- Oh, God.

751
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,242
All right, Charlie.

752
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,513
- Go ahead.
- Why me, man?

753
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,474
Why you? You're the monkey. You go. Go.

754
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,395
Hold me, Charlie. Hold me, man.

755
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,649
It's a tin can all dressed up.
Good for fires.

756
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,110
Got a couple of broads
tucked in here, Barney?

757
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,029
Cover the front, huh, Paulie?
Cover the front.

758
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,728
Barney.

759
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,569
- It must be the phone.
- Paulie, give me a break, all right?

760
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,905
Give me a fucking break.

761
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,364
Barney, what is that?

762
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,576
Could be anything.

763
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,380
- Could be a wrong number.
- Absolutely.

764
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,597
There'll be 150 large there.

765
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,225
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

766
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,601
That's all that counts now.

767
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,689
That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.

768
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,525
It's September 21st.

769
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,071
11:25 PM.

770
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,324
Heading for my monthly pick-up
on West Street.

771
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,286
From there to Queens Village

772
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,289
to deliver the money
to Inspector Ed Burns,

773
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,417
whose voice will be
on this tape later on.

774
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:41,799
Hope to be erasing this in Phoenix
in about a year.

775
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:50,099
Did you ever see those big S&M fags?
They go into old buildings like this.

776
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,144
Charlie, that's somebody's personal
paper you're reading there, man.

777
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,440
Big mothers, too.
All dressed in leather and shit.

778
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:13,998
These S&M fags get so carried away,
they beat each other up and whatnot...

779
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,835
Will you please shut your mouth? You're
starting to sound like half a fag.

780
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,545
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

781
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,472
Hey, man, somebody's coming!
Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming.

782
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,474
Somebody's coming.

783
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,395
Get out of sight. Grab the cases, fast!

784
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,604
Come on, Paulie.

785
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,606
- How many?
- One guy.

786
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,651
- Cop?
- No, no, just a guy.

787
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,828
One of the bosses probably
forgot something.

788
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,705
If he comes in here, let me handle it.

789
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,666
- We'll bluff our way through.
- Charlie, I gotta take a leak, man.

790
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,960
Shh. Be quiet.

791
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,130
Oh, fuck. The rope ladder.

792
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,579
Freeze! Freeze or I'll blow you away!

793
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,675
Shit.

794
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,522
- Oh, man.
- Barney, he's not moving.

795
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,817
What are we standing here for?
Let's get the hell outta here, Charlie.

796
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,069
If he's breathing,
our best bet is to get outta here fast

797
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,780
and call an ambulance,
crawl out from under a murder rap.

798
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:13,409
Murder rap?! Nobody came
within 20 feet of that yo-yo.

799
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,619
He dived into that hole
like a fucking gopher!

800
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,039
If somebody dies during a crime,
it's murder, end of story.

801
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,846
Barney, it's a dead cop down there.

802
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,725
- Aw, man.
- A cop? Shit.

803
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,686
You got a lot of explaining
to do now, Paulie.

804
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:23,979
What?

805
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,441
Hey, Barney,
what the fuck are you doing?

806
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,735
- I'm a couple of seconds...
- No!

807
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,445
It ain't gonna change the rap
one way or the other.

808
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,821
No!

809
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,491
Charlie, I ain't leaving this joint
with nothing in my kick after all this!

810
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,444
I don't...

811
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,129
What the hell
is a plainclothes cop doing

812
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,839
wandering around in here after midnight?

813
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,800
- Shit, I don't know.
- You don't know? Hey, you bastard!

814
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,221
You know. You know!
Guaranteed it, you know, Paulie.

815
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,348
You know, you piece of shit.

816
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,853
Charlie, maybe he wasn't
even a real cop, man.

817
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,898
Man, there must be 100 phony cops
wandering around out there,

818
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,123
shaking people down and whatnot.

819
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:12,319
Charlie, Charlie.

820
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,697
- Charlie.
- Get off me, Paulie.

821
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:21,995
Jesus, the kid was right.
There's a hell of a lot of money here.

822
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,582
- The fucking lottery, Charlie!
- The fucking lottery?

823
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,501
Paulie, there's a dead cop down there!

824
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,711
What are you talking about?
You screwed us.

825
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,506
You screwed us. You screwed me, man.

826
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,757
I didn't screw you, Charlie.

827
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,302
He knows. Guaranteed, he knows.
And you're gonna tell me.

828
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,429
There is nothing to tell, Charlie.

829
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,683
Nothing to tell, huh?
You're full of shit, Paulie.

830
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,144
And you're so busy acting stupid,
that you got us on FDR Drive

831
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,854
with commercial plates,
thank you very much.

832
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,690
You shoulda let me drive, Barney.

833
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,532
- Charlie.
- Paulie, shut up.

834
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,742
I gotta take a leak, man.

835
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,622
Charlie... I gotta take a leak, man.

836
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,374
Jesus Christ.

837
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,847
You know, he's got a bum bladder
ever since he was a kid.

838
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:26,143
Charlie, whatever your beef is with him,
you gotta forget it now.

839
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,061
We gotta find out
what the score is here.

840
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,147
Ooh, man.

841
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,613
Yeah, I know, I'm doing it wrong.
With him, you gotta be calm, right?

842
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,989
Yeah.

843
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,047
Charlie, what are you doing? Barney,
talk to him. Get him back inside.

844
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,966
Fucking shut up! Paulie, come out here!

845
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,510
Come out here. Come out here.

846
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,556
- Paulie, get the fuck out here!
- Charlie! Charlie, the cops!

847
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,100
I wanna know what the fuck
is going on right now, you tell me.

848
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,144
You're not telling me something.
I wanna know now.

849
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,687
I ain't holding back nothing!

850
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,815
- Charlie, what the fuck are you doing?
- Shut up! You tell me right now.

851
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,068
I ain't holding back nothing. I swear.

852
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,736
I wanna know. I want answers.
You talk to me.

853
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,987
I wanna know what's going on.

854
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:22,699
- I ain't holding back nothing. I swear.
- Paulie, Don't you lie to me.

855
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,118
- I swear.
- You swear on your kid brother, Vito.

856
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,081
Say "Vito should get stomach cancer
if I'm lying to Charlie." Say that.

857
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,249
That ain't fair, Charlie,
Vito got nothing to do...

858
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:36,004
Say it. Say it. "Vito should get slow
stomach cancer if I'm lying to Charlie."

859
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,383
Jesus Christ, Barney...

860
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,760
- Tell me right now.
- Vito should...

861
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,846
Jesus Christ,
you don't leave a guy no room.

862
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,598
Tell me. Tell me.

863
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,059
I didn't wanna bother you
with every last detail.

864
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,977
There are things
I can take care of, you know.

865
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,398
Like what? Huh? Like what?

866
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,566
Like about Eddie Grant.

867
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,111
Like what?

868
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,113
You know, Bed Bug Eddie.

869
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,492
What about Bed Bug Eddie?

870
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,038
What's the use
of kidding ourselves, Charlie?

871
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,832
That's his trucking company.

872
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,085
Paulie, what's wrong with you?

873
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,964
I don't...

874
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,258
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter?

875
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,719
What is wrong with you? Huh?

876
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,263
What is wrong with you?

877
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,769
What's the matter with a score
like we made tonight, man?!

878
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,153
You been living
with that WASP girl too long.

879
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,824
I don't wanna tell you
things to worry you, man.

880
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,410
I brought you guys together, man.

881
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,752
Kid who tipped you, what was his name?

882
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,337
Frankie Wheels.
He's from the neighborhood.

883
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,798
Frankie Wheels
is gonna know you did it too, Paulie.

884
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,842
Charlie, I wormed it out of him, man.

885
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,595
Bed Bug Eddie,
whoever hung that name on him

886
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,264
sure knew what the hell
he was talking about.

887
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,308
The Bed Bug's got a thing
about hacking people up.

888
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,143
What do you mean, hack up?

889
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,359
Look, we got one shot here.

890
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,324
We don't spend a nickel. Capisce?

891
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,790
Well, we don't have to be crazy
about this either, you know?

892
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,625
100 bucks here for a couple of suits...

893
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,418
Paulie, we don't spend a nickel,
all right?

894
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,171
Not a fucking penny.
You understand me? Not a penny.

895
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,673
Okay, not a penny. Shit.

896
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,885
Just talking about
a couple of suits, you know?

897
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,137
Nickel-and-dime stuff, man.

898
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,475
- Nothing major.
- Hey, not a fucking penny.

899
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,810
You understand me?

900
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,895
We don't spend...
we don't spend a penny.

901
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,980
Not a fucking dime.

902
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,774
Ain't he charming? The fucking idiot.

903
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,362
You all right, honey?

904
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,990
Yeah, everything's fine. Go back
to bed. I'll be there in a minute.

905
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,002
You woke her.

906
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,927
Charlie, relax, man.

907
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,973
I mean, God forbid, things really
go sour, I could reach out for us.

908
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,392
- To who?
- Pete.

909
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,352
Uncle Pete would bail us out, man.

910
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,105
He's my goombah and, Charlie,
I still call him Uncle.

911
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,065
And he's on Eddie Grant's crew, man.

912
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,900
You can't do shit, Paulie.

913
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,319
Aw, Charlie.

914
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,784
Charlie, I never knew nothing
about no payoff to cops, I swear.

915
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,288
I never knew nothing, man. But
what I said would be there was there.

916
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,582
If I'd left it up to you,

917
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,585
we'd have gone out and robbed
that candy store over there, man.

918
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:05,714
Hey, there comes a time
you got to cowboy it, Charlucc'.

919
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,382
Yeah.

920
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,992
I got five grand for anybody
who brings me these thieves.

921
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,077
I want that all over the street.

922
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,246
- Five?
- That's right!

923
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,998
Where do we stand with the cops, Eddie?

924
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,959
Let those Irish hard-ons
take care of themselves.

925
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,753
I want those guys.

926
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,442
They found him at the bottom
of an elevator shaft.

927
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,110
I got the call just
as I was leaving the house.

928
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,031
Jesus, that means the Internal Affairs
shoo-flies will be poking around.

929
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,243
Brace yourself for worse news, John.
Ritter was wired.

930
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,912
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

931
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,456
They found the adhesive marks
and the microphone.

932
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,335
I've worked 27 years putting together
a little something

933
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,003
for myself and the family.

934
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,131
There's 27 years hoarding in there.

935
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,343
Stinking inflation eating it up
just as fast as I could fill it.

936
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,947
Ease up, John.

937
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,491
I'm drinking what I always have.

938
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,452
You're drinking three martinis
in place of lunch every day.

939
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,330
Then chewing up a whole
raw onion like it was an apple.

940
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,791
You look like a neon sign
for Gordon's gin.

941
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,470
Can I offer you a drink?

942
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,265
We're on duty.

943
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,812
Hey! Excuse me.

944
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,106
You on duty, too?

945
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,858
Yeah.

946
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,571
Just a few questions, Mrs. Ritter.

947
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:41,036
Did Bunky act peculiar
the last few months or so?

948
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,246
Different?

949
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,083
What the hell has that got to do
with some thief

950
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,586
pushing him down the elevator shaft?

951
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,507
He was wearing a tape recorder,
Mrs. Ritter.

952
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,259
Do you know anything about that?

953
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,471
How the hell would I know?
You're the policeman.

954
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,727
Did Bunky have a girlfriend?

955
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,813
Who were some of his friends?

956
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,107
No one.

957
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,318
He went to church a lot.

958
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,363
Sacred Heart.

959
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,784
Most of his free time he spent there.

960
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,327
He must have had some friends.

961
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:27,540
It's important that we locate any tapes
that Bunky may have had.

962
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,920
Yeah, I bet it's important.

963
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,174
I bet it's very important
to the two of yous.

964
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,599
The Internal Affairs people
were here hours ago.

965
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,937
Two college-educated little pricks.

966
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,066
Acted like they was
born and bred in Ohio.

967
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,947
I'm gonna tell you what I told them.

968
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:07,038
Walter neither drank nor gambled.

969
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,041
He disapproved of the lottery.

970
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,002
His spare time was spent making novenas

971
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,296
over at the Sacred Heart.

972
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,507
Did they dig around in his room?

973
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,177
I wouldn't let 'em.

974
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:23,388
Well, we're going to have to.
It's important.

975
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,225
Now, uh... which room is Bunky's?

976
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,353
You are not poking around
in Walter's room.

977
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,731
We're going through this place, madam.

978
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,358
You obstruct me and I'll personally see

979
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,777
that you never see a cent
of his pension.

980
01:07:38,928 --> 01:07:41,990
Get out. Get outta here,
the two of yous.

981
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:47,245
After you're gone, I'm gonna tear this
place upside down like a cyclone hit it.

982
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,622
I'm gonna call The Daily News

983
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:53,376
to do a story on how
the New York City Police Department

984
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,795
treats the mother of a hero.

985
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,299
My brother's a priest.

986
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:04,387
He is an old-fashioned
parish priest with gray hair.

987
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:07,599
The two of us could do a scene
on the 6:00 news

988
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,059
would have this city in tears.

989
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:19,027
My Walter was as tough as a bar of iron,

990
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,988
and he didn't get that from his father.

991
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:27,410
Now, you wanna fight, officer?

992
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,582
Or do you get the hell out of my house?

993
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:11,162
Seven, eight! And one, two, three, four.

994
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:15,208
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

995
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,170
To the side, two, three, four!

996
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,966
To the side, two, three, four!

997
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,761
Shoulders.
One, two, three, four! Reverse!

998
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,681
- What are you doing here?
- I have to talk to you.

999
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,432
Three, four, keep going.

1000
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,352
Tina, can you take over for me
for a minute, please?

1001
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,356
They're trying out for a commercial.
We got a lot of work to do.

1002
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,566
Diane, I have to talk to you.

1003
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,902
Come on, Diane.

1004
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,239
Five, six, seven, eight, and one...

1005
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,158
What are you doing here, Paulie?
Thinking of joining?

1006
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,829
Maybe. Very possible. Looks nice.

1007
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,123
Seven, eight, and smile!

1008
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,500
Paulie, give me a break.

1009
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:03,172
Seven and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, and hold!

1010
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,842
Oka, gang, shake it out
a little bit, loosen up,

1011
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,510
and we'll start from the beginning.

1012
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:11,556
How could you have
put me in this, Charlie? Huh?

1013
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,976
I'm not... you're not in this.

1014
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,937
A policeman died, Charlie.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1015
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,188
A man died.

1016
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,275
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking world?

1017
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,536
There's a way out of this.

1018
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:38,291
There's 50 grand we got.

1019
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:42,628
Yeah, back in the closet.
That could be our way out.

1020
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,132
It could be our restaurant.

1021
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:50,094
Are you crazy? What do we do?

1022
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,306
Do we sit in our restaurant
and wait for the police to show up

1023
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:57,143
or some psychotic criminal to come
and find you and chop you up?

1024
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,313
Oh, man.

1025
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,523
You listened to that fool, Charlie.

1026
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,027
He's an idiot.
He lives in a fantasy, Charlie.

1027
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,154
Look,
Paulie has nothing to do with this.

1028
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:12,742
- Diane, I made my own decision.
- Paulie uses you, Charlie.

1029
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,161
Don't you see what you get
for your loyalty to family?

1030
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,621
He uses you.

1031
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:21,542
Why are you always one inch away
from becoming a good person, huh?

1032
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,217
Maybe, I don't know...
maybe you're too soft.

1033
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:34,055
I'm just too soft?
What are you? Some tough guy?

1034
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:38,226
The men up in Maine make you and Paulie
look like spoiled little brats.

1035
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,854
I was raised to believe
that criminals...

1036
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:46,359
criminals were too weak,
too weak to make it honestly.

1037
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,655
Diane, maybe that shit works in Maine.
Here, on the streets, it don't work.

1038
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,865
Okay? It don't work.

1039
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,869
Such a pathetic excuse, you know?

1040
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:00,456
You just miss... you just miss by a...

1041
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:04,085
another fucking inch, you know,
and you could really be someone special.

1042
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,921
But you're all caught up
in your tribal loyalty,

1043
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,798
your neighborhood, Paulie...

1044
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,300
Diane, maybe I don't
wanna change, all right?

1045
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,304
You ever think of that? Huh?

1046
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:18,307
If I don't wanna change,
what the fuck are you doing with me?

1047
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,396
What the fuck have you
been doing with me all this time?

1048
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,277
I always knew this would happen.

1049
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,738
What the...

1050
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,577
Hit me again. See if I change.
Come on. Hit me again. Come on.

1051
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,337
- Huh? Huh?
- Let go of me.

1052
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,388
Charlie!

1053
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,613
Nicky Dum Dum found out
who robbed my money.

1054
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,200
Well, that's great.

1055
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,037
How come it wasn't you that found out?

1056
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,998
Hey...

1057
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,125
all my guys
been knocking their brains out.

1058
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,044
So Nicky got there first. Good for him.

1059
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:13,089
Maybe you got there first
and you forget to tell me.

1060
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,342
What the hell are you talking about?

1061
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,511
Somebody ratted.

1062
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,013
It was that kid from Carmine Street.

1063
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:26,561
Paulie somebody.
The kid you call your nephew?

1064
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:30,147
Hey, Paulie don't rob safes.
He's a fucking waiter.

1065
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,443
He's a scumbag, that's what he is,
him and whoever was with him.

1066
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:08,853
Aw, man another 200-a-week hard on
looking to shit on anybody

1067
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,438
who ain't driving a Coupe de Ville.

1068
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,440
- Guy's doing his job.
- Yeah?

1069
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,087
- What did you drag me up here for?
- Come on in. Come on in.

1070
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,215
What's up?

1071
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,595
Paulie. They're gonna nail him, Charlie.

1072
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:47,850
I can smell it. He left the file behind.

1073
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,728
- So what?
- Fingerprints!

1074
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,733
Fucking shit. God damn him.

1075
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,110
And he's gonna feed them me.

1076
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,863
He won't give you up.
There's blood there.

1077
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,783
Blood. That fucking kid's blood.
We're third cousins. He's...

1078
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,286
With Italians, that's like
twin brothers with the Irish.

1079
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,497
And when he feeds me to them,

1080
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,291
they're gonna press me
to give them you, Charlie.

1081
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,460
They're gonna press me hard.

1082
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:18,839
And if I clam up, you skate away,
clean as a whistle.

1083
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,346
Yeah? For what? How much?

1084
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,183
Charlie, it's not what you think.

1085
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,937
My end of this, I want it for my kid.

1086
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:37,608
I leave that money with my wife,
they'll take it off her in 12 minutes.

1087
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,903
I need somebody who'll make sure my wife
gets that money if I take a fall.

1088
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,864
Whoa, Barney. Whoa.
There's got to be some other way.

1089
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,325
No, no, I've been making lists up
in my head for hours.

1090
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,119
I got no one else, my friend.

1091
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,621
Why don't you just split
with the money now?

1092
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,206
I can't.

1093
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,376
I can't leave those two
until I'm backed dead into a corner.

1094
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,880
And I can't go on a lam
with a 25-year-old

1095
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,508
needs the side of his crib
pulled up every night.

1096
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,219
Barney, you can't lay this on me.
Can't lay this on me.

1097
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,347
- Charlie, I'm making you a deal.
- Open the door.

1098
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:11,225
- You got a sense of honor.
- Open the door.

1099
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,854
- I can smell it in ya.
- Open the fucking door, come on.

1100
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:21,235
It's saltwater. Briglia wants
to toughen up her legs.

1101
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,447
He's from the South.

1102
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,535
She looks like a fucking joke
rather than a racehorse, you know?

1103
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:31,245
Joke? What are you talking about?

1104
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,372
I got five grand on this horse, Paulie.
It better be no joke.

1105
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,332
I know, I know.

1106
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:40,171
It's just that I never seen a horse
with its legs in no garbage can.

1107
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,673
What do you know
about training a horse, huh?

1108
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:46,719
Waiting tables is what you know.
Making cheese is what I know.

1109
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,846
Let's stay with what we know here.

1110
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,515
You know about making cheese?

1111
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,268
Not for nothin', Jimmy,
but my mother sent me over

1112
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,729
a hunk of mozzarell'
from your place last week.

1113
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,731
It was no big bargain.

1114
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:02,109
Tough, tat mozzarell', and it ain't
the first time I noticed it, either.

1115
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,196
- Your mozzarell' is tough sometimes.
- Are you nuts?

1116
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,324
The Garguzzos never sold a piece
of tough mozzarell' in our life.

1117
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:11,243
Tough like fucking shoe leather,
that mozzarell'.

1118
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:38,729
- Hey, Paulino.
- Hi, Uncle Pete. I was gonna call you.

1119
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,190
Let's go talk private.

1120
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,074
Where do you come off
to steal from Eddie Grant?

1121
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:54,245
You ain't even a full-time thief.
You're a waiter, for Christ's sake.

1122
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,584
- Can you bail me out, Uncle Pete?
- I'm treading water myself.

1123
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,169
Oh, man.

1124
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:06,465
You pay attention,
'cause your life depends on this.

1125
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,300
If you won't say
who was with ya, Paulie,

1126
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,094
your head gets hung
on your mother's doorknob.

1127
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,179
He wouldn't really do that, Pete.

1128
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,932
And he'd sit down to a steak pizzaiol'
right after.

1129
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,227
Come on.

1130
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,774
And what if I rat?

1131
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,068
He's still gonna do
a Bed Bug Eddie number on ya.

1132
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,279
Man.

1133
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,199
He'd be making me a cripple.

1134
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:35,452
He wants to crush me. And for what?

1135
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:39,123
For what? I didn't rape his daughter.

1136
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,375
I didn't spit in his fat face.

1137
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:45,880
I took money from him.
I took fucking money.

1138
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,050
It don't call for this, Pete.

1139
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:54,855
I gotta take a leak.

1140
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,148
Come on.

1141
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:10,279
Oh, man.

1142
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,956
Hey.

1143
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,883
What would you do,
you was in my shoes, Pete?

1144
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,177
Me?

1145
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:38,307
First espresso I carried to the bastard
would have a cupful of lye in it.

1146
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,937
What do I do?
I can't put lye in Eddie Grant's coffee.

1147
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:48,025
But I can't rat either.
I ain't built that way.

1148
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,278
Paulie, in my life,
I never told nobody to rat.

1149
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,657
But it ain't the old days.
Wise guys rat people out now.

1150
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:56,700
I can't, Pete!

1151
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,500
What happens to anyone what was with me?

1152
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,296
- Who knows?
- Oh, man.

1153
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,300
What about the money?

1154
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,719
What did you bag?

1155
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,806
50 large. That's what my end came to.

1156
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,185
Gimme... gimme 43 to bring Eddie.

1157
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:26,188
Just say you blew the rest.
The maniac'll...

1158
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:29,525
The maniac will hardly even count it.

1159
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,113
What do they want?

1160
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,409
This ain't no joke, Paulie.

1161
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,213
I had a partner, Pete.

1162
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,134
I was with another guy.

1163
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,887
Some old Irish hard-on from the Bronx.
I don't owe him nothing.

1164
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,976
Barney. Fixes clocks.

1165
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:06,353
Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue
in the Bronx.

1166
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,732
An old guy.

1167
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,984
An old-time thief.

1168
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:20,701
Paulie, nothing ever hurts
like you think it will.

1169
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,286
You go numb.

1170
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,288
Then you wrap
your belt around your wrist

1171
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,249
and you get yourself
to the nearest emergency room.

1172
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,502
Oh, Uncle Pete.

1173
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,880
Oh, Uncle Pete...

1174
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,473
Oh, Uncle Pete. Uncle Pete.

1175
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,600
Uncle Pete.

1176
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,315
Uncle Pete!

1177
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:58,072
Can you believe it?
Bed Bug had that kid's thumb taken off.

1178
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,908
Jesus Christ.

1179
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:07,414
He's like some Arab sheik
walking around with that crazy bulldog.

1180
01:23:07,565 --> 01:23:11,043
Yeah, but that's why Little Italy
got their own law and order.

1181
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,753
Wanna know something?

1182
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,671
It's the only neighborhood in the city

1183
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:19,093
where little kids and old ladies
can still walk the streets at night.

1184
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:22,137
Why the hell did Bed Bug
give us this one anyway?

1185
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:26,183
It's a favor, I think.
"You can have the Irish," he told me.

1186
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,393
"Keep it in the family."

1187
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,396
Fucking humps.

1188
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:34,775
They're all alike.
They think they're real cute.

1189
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,946
- There. It's over there.
- We got him here.

1190
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:59,902
Charlie... this is not easy for me.

1191
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,989
Our baby needs
a good start in life, Charlie.

1192
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:09,244
So I don't feel guilty about taking
the shoebox full of money for the baby.

1193
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,580
I've left you $5,000.

1194
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:16,168
With $45,000, our baby
will have a good chance in life.

1195
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,130
It should be a comfort you to know that.

1196
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:25,177
I've been thinking about what
my life would be like, living with you.

1197
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:28,263
The truth is, Charlie,
I can't go through life

1198
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,349
living with someone I could never trust.

1199
01:26:26,723 --> 01:26:28,490
- Paulie, what happened?
- Charlie...

1200
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:31,535
- they took my thumb, man.
- Who did? Who did?

1201
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,287
It hurts so much.

1202
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:37,082
- Paulie, what happened?
- The Bed Bug took my thumb, man.

1203
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:41,003
Oh, no. No. Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

1204
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,298
No, Charlucc'.
That guy's a fucking psycho, man.

1205
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,799
He'll chop you up.

1206
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:49,136
- Paulie...
- Oh, man, it hurts so much.

1207
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,179
- Did they give you anything for this?
- Yeah.

1208
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:52,764
- What did they give you?
- Yeah.

1209
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,017
They gave me... they gave me this stuff.

1210
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,894
They gave me this stuff at the hospital.

1211
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,647
But I took all of it.
I've been taking it all day.

1212
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,733
- You took all of this?
- It ain't done a fucking thing!

1213
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,736
- You took all of this?
- I took it all, man.

1214
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:10,282
- Charlie, I didn't do nothing, man.
- Paulie, what can I do for you?

1215
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:12,617
- What can I do for you?
- It was my life, man.

1216
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:17,205
I didn't wanna give the poor bastard up,
but it was my life, Charlie.

1217
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:24,212
Barney ain't family.
I don't owe him that much.

1218
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,922
You gave Barney up?
What about me, Paulie?

1219
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,967
Paulie, I'm family.
Did they press you for me?

1220
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:33,638
Yeah. Yeah, they... they pressed me.

1221
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,807
They pressed me hard.

1222
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:41,063
They took my thumb, Charlie!!

1223
01:27:41,881 --> 01:27:43,940
Paulie.

1224
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,490
What the hell happened here, man?

1225
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,578
Look at that chair, man.
What the hell happened here, Charlie?

1226
01:27:56,729 --> 01:27:59,373
She walked out.
She took the money and she left.

1227
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:03,668
That twat robbed ya?
My God, what did you do, Charlie?

1228
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,546
I didn't do anything, Paulie.
I didn't hit her. I didn't do nothing.

1229
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,006
You can't do that, man.

1230
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:11,385
You don't abuse 'em once in a while,
they'll shit all over ya.

1231
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,595
I don't mean that you walk around
morning to night

1232
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:16,306
whacking 'em upside the head
like someone from the other side,

1233
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:20,060
but you gotta terrorize 'em once
in a while just to keep 'em in line.

1234
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,728
I mean, like, you know,

1235
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:26,650
sometimes when they embarrass ya
in front of your friends,

1236
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,568
you whack 'em with the backhand.

1237
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,280
Not out in the middle of the room
like some fucking animal, you know,

1238
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:36,159
but nice, in the bedroom, you know?

1239
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:38,662
Ba-boom. Ow.

1240
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,456
What am I? Some kind of asshole?

1241
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,292
Ba-boom. Another one. Oh.

1242
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:47,629
Shit. What is this?!
Some kinda fucking joke?!

1243
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:51,883
You get your coat on fast,
and you don't say good night to nobody.

1244
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:55,470
You understand me? Huh? Huh?

1245
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,936
That's to keep 'em humble.

1246
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:06,481
When you don't let 'em say
good night to nobody,

1247
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:10,485
they walk out
looking at the fucking floor.

1248
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,616
Charlie!!

1249
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:19,911
They took my thumb!

1250
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:24,416
Paulie. Paulie.

1251
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,928
Bed Bug, I'm gonna fucking kill you,
God damn it!

1252
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,765
Paulie... Paulie... Paulie.

1253
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:48,231
The motherfucking...

1254
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,612
Paulie. Oh, Paulie.

1255
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,365
I know... Paulie...

1256
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,788
It's better if you don't know.

1257
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,708
Here.

1258
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:11,880
Here's $1,000.
I'll send you $200 every week.

1259
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,301
Nora, don't fall apart on me now, huh?

1260
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:21,139
- Huh?
- How did you let this happen to you?

1261
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:24,726
Oh, how did I let my whole
life happen to me?

1262
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:36,530
Why does it never work out right for us?

1263
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,950
Why, Barney?
Why does it never work out right?

1264
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,246
Nora, maybe I wasn't
the smartest kid on the block, huh?

1265
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:48,708
I did the best I could, huh?
For the three of us.

1266
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,180
I gotta go.

1267
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,669
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Aw, Jesus Christ.

1268
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:16,963
All right. Here.

1269
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:19,090
I was having a bad dream.

1270
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:21,343
How do you feel? Huh?

1271
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,304
How's your hand?

1272
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,557
I don't know yet.

1273
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,978
You eat some of this.
You'll feel better.

1274
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,022
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

1275
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,070
Here you go.

1276
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:45,867
Yuck.

1277
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,913
- What's the matter?
- It's canned, man.

1278
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,415
- It's good for you.
- Yeah.

1279
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:55,377
White bread?

1280
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:59,839
No wonder these WASPs
got no color, huh, Charlie?

1281
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:06,429
Hey, maybe she...
she outgrew me, you know? I mean...

1282
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,808
These WASPs, you know,
they outgrow people.

1283
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:11,434
Yeah, right.

1284
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,274
Our mothers was right, Charlucc'.

1285
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,069
You really gotta stick
with your own kind, you know?

1286
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,863
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1287
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:32,247
Charlie...

1288
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,419
you know what really busts my balls?

1289
01:33:40,072 --> 01:33:42,841
I gotta go to work for that maniac.

1290
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,970
I gotta be a God damn
coffee boy in the club.

1291
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:01,109
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1292
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,779
- All right?
- Absolutely.

1293
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:36,561
Three sugars, Eddie?

1294
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,443
Close the door.

1295
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,414
Sit down.

1296
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,802
No, sit over here.

1297
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:25,985
Do you ever listen to tapes, Paulie?

1298
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:31,741
Them, uh...
tapes that everybody sees all over?

1299
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,456
I've been thinking
how you and that Irishman

1300
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:41,417
did that piece of work up there.

1301
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,586
It was you and him, no?

1302
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,719
Barney. That's his name.

1303
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,263
Barney.

1304
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:56,641
This Irishman who you gave
two-thirds the split to?

1305
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,855
- Are you comfortable, Paulie?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm comfortable.

1306
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:05,316
Tell me exactly how you handled it.

1307
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:08,903
Who carried the stuff upstairs?

1308
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,198
Who watched the window?

1309
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:15,076
I wanna know
each detail of who did what.

1310
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:22,584
Well, uh... me and the Irishman,
you know, the two of us, we had...

1311
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,002
Two?

1312
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,004
Not three?

1313
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:30,800
Two.

1314
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,513
Take it easy. Don't rush.

1315
01:36:35,664 --> 01:36:38,224
We're gonna go through this
a couple of times.

1316
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:04,918
Hello?

1317
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:07,295
Diane?

1318
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:11,633
Diane, is that you?

1319
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:26,189
Luna, luna, luna, lu

1320
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:30,193
I'll be waiting here for you

1321
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:33,863
I live by moonlight

1322
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:37,659
So give me moonlight

1323
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:41,412
Who knows? I soon might

1324
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:44,916
Give you my heart

1325
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,962
Luna, luna, luna, lu

1326
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:55,426
Hey, Paulie, buddy.
Hey, where are you going?

1327
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:58,554
Take a hike, asshole.

1328
01:38:23,188 --> 01:38:27,166
What was so important we had to
stop off at the apartment for that?

1329
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,544
I got a phone call from Chicago,
from Barney.

1330
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,921
That was his end of it.

1331
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,339
50,000?

1332
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:36,801
You just mailed $50,000
to some Irish retard?

1333
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:40,513
Hey, don't be so fucking selfish,
all right, Paulie?

1334
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:42,390
I mean, come on,
I thought about this the whole week.

1335
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,683
Had to do the right thing.

1336
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:46,227
Charlie, some thief
is gonna hand the kid a rattle,

1337
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:48,104
and he's gonna give him 50 large.

1338
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:52,442
Shit. He sure as hell ain't gonna
go out and party with it, Charlie.

1339
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,652
- You're a selfish fuck, you know that?
- "The right thing."

1340
01:39:19,995 --> 01:39:21,888
That's for you.
Grab yourself a beer after work.

1341
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:23,347
Thanks.

1342
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,852
- What did you do?
- What did I do? I tipped the guy.

1343
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:33,232
- Big shot.
- Charlie, I only gave him a buck, man.

1344
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,071
I mean, what is so terrible?

1345
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,657
The poor victim stands in a little
closet breathing car fumes all day.

1346
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:42,950
The job's a sentence.

1347
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:46,079
Gotta throw 'em a beanie once just
to make their day, know what I mean?

1348
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:50,041
Charlie, we made his day. His week.

1349
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:56,130
Big fucking shot you are, Paulie.

1350
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,680
Why the hell do you wanna
go to the grandstand?

1351
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,766
The clubhouse is nicer.

1352
01:40:06,917 --> 01:40:09,393
Hey, asshole, watch out, will ya?

1353
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:11,395
The grandstand's
where the regular guys are.

1354
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:13,773
The clubhouse is full of phonies.

1355
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,656
I thought we was going
to the grandstand.

1356
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:23,407
No, man.

1357
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:26,911
The clubhouse is the only place
to really see a race from.

1358
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:29,372
You stay in the grandstand
and you're with every garbage can

1359
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:30,623
walking the street.

1360
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:32,125
Every garbage can walking the...

1361
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:35,169
You'll wind up with crabs
over there, you know?

1362
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:39,799
Hey, Charlie, that's on me, man.
The midnight flight for Miami.

1363
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:44,095
We're gonna make money here today,
then we're gonna party on the beach.

1364
01:40:44,246 --> 01:40:48,099
We're gonna live like a couple of sports
instead of busted suitcases, you know?

1365
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,852
Starry Hope. Ba-boom.

1366
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:54,689
See "TR"? That means "trainer."

1367
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,440
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

1368
01:40:56,592 --> 01:41:01,112
See where it says "F"?
"F," that means "filly."

1369
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:02,697
They call girl horses fillies.

1370
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,199
And if you see a "G," Charlie,
that means "gelding."

1371
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,034
That's when they whack
the horse's dick off.

1372
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,870
- Ba-boom, it's a memory, man.
- The balls, the balls.

1373
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,831
- The balls. The dick, man.
- No, they whack the balls.

1374
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:15,209
They whack the balls off.
They don't whack the dick off.

1375
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,211
Yeah, okay.

1376
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:20,256
Look at that pile of garbage
she's up against, man.

1377
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:24,051
There'll be a flock of seagulls
following 'em around the track, man.

1378
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,472
- What's going on with you today?
- What?

1379
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:30,766
You're acting really, uh... nervous.

1380
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:33,644
I'm excited, man. We're gonna
win money here today, Charlie.

1381
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:36,272
I feel it in my bones, man.

1382
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:38,900
How do you wanna go?
How do you wanna bet her?

1383
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,484
- What do you mean, man?
- What do you want to do?

1384
01:41:40,636 --> 01:41:42,320
Wanna go straight across the board?

1385
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:45,281
Jesus Christ, Charlie, don't jinx her
with place and show bets.

1386
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:47,867
For once in your life,
don't hedge, okay?

1387
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:50,786
You got a chance to win here today,
Charlie, play to win.

1388
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:53,706
Hey, Paulie, sometimes if you play it
a little safe, it don't hurt.

1389
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:56,125
Charlie, think like a winner, okay?

1390
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:59,587
That's what it takes to bounce back,
and I should know, no?

1391
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:02,298
Johnny Black, rocks, man.
What you having, man?

1392
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,592
- The usual.
- J&B over here.

1393
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:11,807
Starry Hope.
Post position four. That's okay.

1394
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,018
Let's see. Okay, look here.

1395
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:16,395
They tell you the color the jockey
wears, you know,

1396
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,439
so you can tell one horse from another.

1397
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:21,901
Okay, let's see. Orange, pink yuk.

1398
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:23,444
- Pink what?
- Yuk.

1399
01:42:23,595 --> 01:42:24,862
- What the fuck is a yuk?

1400
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:27,031
It's the thing that goes
around their neck.

1401
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:29,450
Hey, stupid, that's a yoke.

1402
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:30,868
- Yeah.
- A pink yoke.

1403
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:33,162
Yeah, pink blocks on sleeves.

1404
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:37,750
Orange cap with pink pompom and visser.

1405
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:40,628
Can you believe that get-up?

1406
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:42,004
What's a visser?

1407
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,798
A visser, it's the thing
on the front of the cap.

1408
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:46,300
See, you always do this.
That's a visor. That's a yoke.

1409
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:48,427
That's a visor.
You say "visser" and "yuk."

1410
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:51,055
You get everything fucked up.
You better bet on the right horse.

1411
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,226
I'm not worried
about how to say the words.

1412
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:56,686
I'm worried
about how the jock's gonna look.

1413
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:00,439
The Cheese Man has him looking like
some fag partying at Fire Island, man.

1414
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,191
Paulie, why don't you
forget about the colors?

1415
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:04,527
Is this horse gonna win here today?
Are we gonna make some money?

1416
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,822
Is she gonna win? Is she gonna win?
He asks me "Is she gonna win?"

1417
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:11,158
Charlie, you laughed
when I told you about the champion gene,

1418
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,451
but she got it, man.

1419
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:13,744
The champion gene?

1420
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:17,665
The groom who jerked her father off...

1421
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:21,544
was not just winding his watch, okay?

1422
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,089
Salut', Charlucc'.

1423
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:33,639
You're a strange man, you know that?

1424
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:36,017
You're gonna be kissing me
at the finish line.

1425
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,893
You're a very strange man,
Paulie Gibonni.

1426
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,521
Salut', Sambrini.

1427
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:47,278
Easy, baby.

1428
01:43:54,686 --> 01:43:57,872
In you go. In there. That's it.

1429
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:10,343
Whoa. Attaboy.

1430
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:24,607
Come on already. Come on already.

1431
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:26,650
They're all in line.

1432
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,616
Moving out to get the lead, Persian Rug.

1433
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:35,785
Come on, Starry Hope.
Come on, Starry Hope.

1434
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,454
- Starry Hope moves up on the inside...
- Where is she?

1435
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,956
Down the back stretch...

1436
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:46,462
There goes Starry Hope now
to get the lead.

1437
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:49,548
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

1438
01:44:52,786 --> 01:44:56,347
All right! Go, Starry Hope!
Go, Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

1439
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:01,602
Hemmings Way moves up quickly
between horses

1440
01:45:01,753 --> 01:45:03,938
Starry Hope. Starry Hope. Starry Hope.

1441
01:45:14,599 --> 01:45:15,825
Watch, Paulie. Watch.

1442
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,082
Come on, baby. Paulie, watch!

1443
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,584
Hope, Hope, Hope...

1444
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,294
Starry Hope, Starry Hope...

1445
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:31,674
It's Starry Hope on the outside...

1446
01:45:32,784 --> 01:45:34,468
Go, Starry. Starry Hope.

1447
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:41,600
- Tell me she won, Charlie.
- This result is not official.

1448
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:45,020
Charlie, tell me she won, Charlie.
Tell me she won, man.

1449
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:47,773
- Tell me she won, Charlie.
- It's a photo.

1450
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,402
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be your name,

1451
01:45:51,553 --> 01:45:53,237
thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

1452
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:55,489
Starry fucking Hope. Please, God.

1453
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,578
Please, please, please.
Please, God, please, please God.

1454
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,372
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go somewhere?

1455
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:05,082
Wanna go have a drink, huh?

1456
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:08,127
- I wanna go to Miami.
- You wanna go to Miami?

1457
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:11,505
Yeah. It's warm there, Charlie.

1458
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,468
Sit down over here.
I gotta go take a leak.

1459
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,845
- You gotta take a leak?
- Sit down here, I gotta take a leak.

1460
01:46:17,996 --> 01:46:19,763
- Okay, hurry.
- All right.

1461
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,515
- Just stay there.
- Okay, but hurry up.

1462
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:22,850
Stay there.

1463
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,529
Damn. Shit.

1464
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:39,116
By a nose, man.

1465
01:46:39,267 --> 01:46:41,327
By a fucking nose.

1466
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:43,954
Hey, you know,
she ran her heart out though, no?

1467
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:46,248
What are you gonna do?

1468
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:50,669
Be nice to get a photo of that finish.
We could blow it up, poster size.

1469
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,672
Yeah. I don't need no pictures.

1470
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,468
Hey, Paulie, money comes, and it goes.
Things are gonna work out.

1471
01:46:57,619 --> 01:46:59,637
You just gotta take 'em
how they come, you know?

1472
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:02,765
You gotta be a... good sport about it.

1473
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,354
- Got a dollar?
- You need 50 cents.

1474
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,277
Here.

1475
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,029
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1476
01:47:22,352 --> 01:47:23,827
You didn't tip him.

1477
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:26,163
Poor son of a bitch
stands in a booth all day long.

1478
01:47:26,314 --> 01:47:28,874
Fuck him. What am I? Santa Claus?

1479
01:47:29,025 --> 01:47:31,585
Fuck him? Hey, Paulie,
let me tell you something.

1480
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:33,796
Don't worry about it
'cause when you connect,

1481
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:36,215
you're gonna connect to big bucks.

1482
01:47:36,366 --> 01:47:40,928
Me, I only connected
with a lousy 20 grand.

1483
01:47:42,372 --> 01:47:44,557
Charlie.

1484
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:49,019
I knew you kept some of Barney's money.
I knew you weren't no dummy.

1485
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:51,647
No, baby, I, uh... bet
Starry Hope across the board.

1486
01:47:54,384 --> 01:47:57,444
That's why she lost!
You jinxed her, Charlie!

1487
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:59,655
You jinxed her, man.

1488
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:12,126
Hey, Charlie, that's a hydrant.
We can't park here.

1489
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:13,627
Hey, please, give me a break.

1490
01:48:13,778 --> 01:48:15,546
What do you want me to do,
drive round the block?

1491
01:48:15,697 --> 01:48:17,590
It's a $25 ticket, Charlie.

1492
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:19,925
Hey, Paulie, thank God it's here.
It's worth every cent.

1493
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:21,427
Hey, man, this is crazy.

1494
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:24,430
We ought to be on our way
to Miami right this second.

1495
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:26,098
It's warm there, Charlie.

1496
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:27,933
Let's have one drink, huh?

1497
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:31,312
- Okay, one drink.
- Yeah.

1498
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:32,563
- One.
- Yeah.

1499
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:34,356
Absolutely.

1500
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,568
I'll have a Remy, soda back.

1501
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:39,695
- I'll have the same, Tony.
- Things could be worse, huh?

1502
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:40,988
Yeah.

1503
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:42,906
Things could be worse.

1504
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:45,576
I mean, I got the restaurant after all.

1505
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:50,748
To the restaurant.

1506
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:52,416
Salut', Charlucc'.

1507
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:57,838
Okay, that's our one drink.
Let's go, Charlie.

1508
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:00,007
Whoa, Paulie, what is the hurry?

1509
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:04,053
Can we stay here, have a drink
and relax a little bit? Huh? Huh?

1510
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:06,221
Yeah.

1511
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:10,601
By the way, I didn't ask, uh...

1512
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:13,103
- How's your pop doing?
- Oh, good. Good, yeah.

1513
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:14,772
Good? Oh, hey.

1514
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:16,440
He's doing good.

1515
01:49:17,008 --> 01:49:18,317
He'll be all right.

1516
01:49:18,468 --> 01:49:20,194
Charlie, there's something
I gotta tell you.

1517
01:49:30,313 --> 01:49:33,082
I'm really sorry about
this whole mess, you know?

1518
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:37,503
Hey, Paulie. Hey.
Don't worry about it, all right?

1519
01:49:38,154 --> 01:49:40,005
Okay? Things are gonna work out.

1520
01:49:40,156 --> 01:49:44,051
I mean, aside from Diane leaving and...

1521
01:49:44,202 --> 01:49:45,928
you know, what happened to your hand.

1522
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:48,222
It's gonna be all right.

1523
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:52,393
Hey, ci andiamo, huh?

1524
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:54,395
Forever. Absolutely.

1525
01:49:57,465 --> 01:50:00,109
Okay, that's it, Charlie. Let's go, man.

1526
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,277
Put your money away. I got it.

1527
01:50:03,805 --> 01:50:05,864
Anthony.

1528
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:09,993
Keep it.

1529
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:12,871
Can we please take a walk
for a minute, Charlie?

1530
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:16,291
What for?

1531
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:18,252
There's something I gotta tell you, man.

1532
01:50:21,406 --> 01:50:22,673
So tell me here.

1533
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:26,176
Barney.

1534
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:34,393
Something funny must have gone down
up there in the Bronx, you know?

1535
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:39,022
Uh, those... those cops
who grabbed Barney, you know?

1536
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:42,067
Uh, they must have
made a deal or something, Charlie.

1537
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:43,986
Where you going?
Where the fuck are you going?

1538
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:46,780
Talk to me. What are you talking about?

1539
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,783
The Bed Bug knows about you, Charlie.

1540
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,245
What?

1541
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:58,709
You fucking little... you fucking rat!

1542
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:04,006
Charlie! Fucking Superman
would have broke, man.

1543
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:08,719
Superman wouldn't have held out.
Charlie, I was just so fucking scared.

1544
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,514
Fucking bum.
You're a fucking bum, Paulie.

1545
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,017
Charlie, Charlie,
we won money today, man.

1546
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,895
We can go to Miami.
We can go to Miami. Please, Charlie.

1547
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:20,939
- You wanna know something?
- We can go to Miami.

1548
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:22,816
You wanna know something,
you piece of shit?

1549
01:51:22,967 --> 01:51:25,444
Diane was right.
You're no fucking good, Paulie.

1550
01:51:25,595 --> 01:51:27,279
- You ain't no fucking good.
- Charlie!

1551
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:29,072
- No, you screwed me, Paulie.
- Charlie!

1552
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:32,034
Charlie, we could go to Miami.

1553
01:51:40,568 --> 01:51:43,587
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.

1554
01:51:43,738 --> 01:51:45,422
That's all that counts, no?

1555
01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:47,591
That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.

1556
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,719
It's September 21st.

1557
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:54,264
11:25 PM.

1558
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,894
Heading for my monthly
pick-up on West Street.

1559
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:02,439
From there, to Queens Village

1560
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:05,651
to deliver the money
to Inspector Ed Burns,

1561
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,862
whose voice
will be on this tape later on.

1562
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:15,160
Hope to be erasing this in Phoenix
in about a year.

1563
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:18,473
This is a private club, pal.

1564
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:20,642
Well, I'd like to see Eddie Grant.

1565
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:34,281
He's in the back room.

1566
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:52,007
You're Charlie Moran?

1567
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,802
You're one of the scumbags
that robbed my money.

1568
01:53:57,705 --> 01:54:00,265
You were brought up around here, no?

1569
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:02,601
Carmine Street.

1570
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,354
Same thing.

1571
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:07,898
And you know you owe
the neighborhood some respect.

1572
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:13,111
People steal from Eddie Grant,
it makes for a total breakdown.

1573
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,447
No one knows right or wrong.

1574
01:54:15,598 --> 01:54:17,950
Before you know it,
you got mulenyams moving in.

1575
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,036
What the hell brings you in here?

1576
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:26,208
A tape I took off a dead cop
that'll hang you by your balls.

1577
01:54:28,486 --> 01:54:30,337
You walked in here to threaten me?

1578
01:54:30,655 --> 01:54:32,656
You're fucking right
I walked in here to threaten you.

1579
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:39,012
The last time somebody talked to me
close to that was from the Village, too.

1580
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:41,807
I parcel-posted the scumbag home.

1581
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:44,768
He didn't have the tape
that could put you away for 20.

1582
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,397
Okay, let me give you some advice.

1583
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:51,525
You're behaving like
a mammalucc'. Capisce?

1584
01:54:51,676 --> 01:54:54,319
You walk in here.
You don't show the club no respect.

1585
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:56,446
You're acting like a scumbag.

1586
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:58,532
You're half Irish, so I...

1587
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:00,951
I make considerations.

1588
01:55:01,978 --> 01:55:03,787
I give you this for the tape.

1589
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:11,086
I promised myself
I'd wipe my ass with this hand.

1590
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:12,879
And nobody...

1591
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:17,009
nobody but the Pope
could walk out of here with his hand.

1592
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:24,266
Mister, I am the Pope.

1593
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:26,977
This might be your church,
but right now,

1594
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:30,731
I'm the Pope of Greenwich Village,
because I got a tape, all right?

1595
01:55:38,139 --> 01:55:41,908
I like you. You have balls.
I don't get too mad at that.

1596
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:45,579
Coffee, Eddie?

1597
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:03,555
Three sugars, Eddie?

1598
01:56:14,258 --> 01:56:16,276
I already put your sugar in, Charlie.

1599
01:56:56,718 --> 01:57:00,403
Lye! I filled his fucking
espresso with lye!

1600
01:57:05,768 --> 01:57:07,410
You got one shot here.
Run. Run like hell.

1601
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:09,496
- What did you do? I had him.
- What do you mean, what did I do?

1602
01:57:09,647 --> 01:57:12,124
I went all the way for you, Charlie.
Come on.

1603
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:15,043
Okay, walk slow and be cool.

1604
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:18,421
- Great.
- Charlie, we got a shot here.

1605
01:57:18,573 --> 01:57:20,882
We got tickets for Miami.

1606
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:24,845
Charlie, things could be
a hell of a lot worse, man.

1607
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:27,347
I mean, we got $20,000 in our pocket.

1608
01:57:27,498 --> 01:57:29,307
Things are looking up, Charlucc'.

1609
01:57:29,459 --> 01:57:32,060
Paulie, you know,
you got a serious thinking disorder.

1610
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:33,937
What are you talking about?

1611
01:57:34,088 --> 01:57:35,981
What am I tal... oh, yeah,
things are looking up.

1612
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:38,275
Absolutely.

1613
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,652
I had him. I had him, Paulie.

1614
01:57:40,803 --> 01:57:45,740
Charlie, what I done back there,
I done 100% for you, man.

1615
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:48,243
For me, right. You tell me about it.

1616
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:50,871
And another thing, man,
you need me, man.

1617
01:57:51,022 --> 01:57:52,330
Without me along,

1618
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:55,083
you'd be nickel-and-diming it
in ten minutes, man.

1619
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:57,752
- I'm the one with the moves.
- You the one with the moves?

1620
01:57:57,945 --> 01:58:00,130
The summer wind

1621
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:02,716
Came blowing in

1622
01:58:02,867 --> 01:58:05,719
From across the sea

1623
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:10,348
It lingered there

1624
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:13,768
To touch your hair

1625
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,730
And walk with me

1626
01:58:19,258 --> 01:58:21,484
All summer long

1627
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:24,070
We sang a song

1628
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:28,658
And then we strolled that golden sand

1629
01:58:31,687 --> 01:58:34,080
Two sweethearts

1630
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:37,751
And the summer wind

1631
01:58:41,697 --> 01:58:43,965
Like painted kites

1632
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:46,259
Those days and nights

1633
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:49,512
They went flying by

1634
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:55,018
The world was new

1635
01:58:55,169 --> 01:59:00,982
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

1636
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:08,240
Then softer than a piper man

1637
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:13,411
One day it called to you

1638
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:18,208
I lost you

1639
01:59:19,193 --> 01:59:22,504
I lost you to the summer wind

1640
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,134
The autumn wind

1641
01:59:28,286 --> 01:59:30,178
And the winter winds

1642
01:59:30,329 --> 01:59:33,265
They have come and gone

1643
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:38,853
And still the days

1644
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,481
Those lonely days

1645
01:59:41,632 --> 01:59:44,901
They go on and on

1646
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,323
And guess who sighs

1647
01:59:50,474 --> 01:59:53,118
His lullabies

1648
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:57,455
Through nights that never end?

1649
02:00:00,318 --> 02:00:03,378
My fickle friend

1650
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:13,847
The summer wind

1651
02:00:14,123 --> 02:00:16,891
Warm summer wind

1652
02:00:20,087 --> 02:00:24,024
Mm, the summer wind
