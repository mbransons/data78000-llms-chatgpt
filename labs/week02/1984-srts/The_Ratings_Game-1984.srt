1
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,348
Television,
the most powerful

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,351
communications tool in the history of man.

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,354
Since its beginning, the
networks have dictated

4
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,733
what comes into our
living rooms, but one man

5
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:28,320
brought these almighty
monoliths to their very knees.

6
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:31,615
His name: Vic De Salvo.

7
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:34,493
This is his story.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,687
- There's Lucille Ball's house.

9
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,606
I love Lucy!

10
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,484
Danny Thomas's is right down the block.

11
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,277
You remember Make Room for Daddy?

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,655
- Yeah, yeah, sure, boss, I remember.

13
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,616
- Let's go borrow a cup
of sugar from Bob Newhart.

14
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,493
- We need sugar, boss?

15
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,745
- How about a quart of
milk from Lonnie Anderson?

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,541
- Yeah, we need milk, too?

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,209
- Bruno, oh, look at that.

18
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,753
Pull up over there, Bruno.

19
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,555
Hi, I'm Vic De Salvo, do
you mind if I say hello?

20
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,647
- That was pretty smooth,
boss, very smooth.

21
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,620
- This is gold, Bruno, pure De Salvo.

22
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,414
- Funny script, huh, boss?

23
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,374
- It's my masterpiece.

24
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,960
Too good for the networks,
I'll tell you that.

25
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,087
Hey, boss, there's
the peacock over there.

26
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,214
- All right, pull over.

27
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,924
It's in the bag, Bruno.

28
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,262
What they respect in
this town is confidence.

29
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,311
No, it's okay, Bruno.

30
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,405
Pow!

31
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,119
- We don't accept unsolicited manuscripts,

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,246
and if we did, we wouldn't accept yours.

33
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,249
- Madame, you do accept
them, and you will,

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,626
and I'll tell you why.

35
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,668
- Security.

36
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,795
- All right, all right,
all right, take it easy,

37
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,881
take it easy, give me the scripts.

38
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,132
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,092
- Hey, Vic, hey, leave him alone!

40
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,886
Hey, hey, hey, get your hands off him.

41
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,305
- That's okay, Bruno.

42
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,748
- Which one did they like the best?

43
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,859
- The networks aren't
buying Italians, Jews,

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,361
and Puerto Ricans this season.

45
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,781
They're buying gays,
alcoholics, child molesters.

46
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,866
- I can't relate to the characters.

47
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,578
You got anything with Nazis, maybe?

48
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:27,123
- Vic, I'm telling you this
because I really like you:

49
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,211
you got no future in this business.

50
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,605
- You son of a bitches are scared.

51
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,819
- How's it going, boss?

52
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,698
- I think I'm on a roll, Bruno, let's go.

53
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,253
I don't know, Bruno.

54
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,046
How come this crap gets on the air

55
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,965
and I can't sell a series?

56
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,550
- What do they know out here, boss?

57
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,844
They ain't got no culture.

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,346
- Yeah.

59
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,743
- Hello, sir.

60
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,453
- Oh, hi, Skip, how are you?

61
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,912
- Thank God you're home.

62
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,622
We've been under siege.

63
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,791
First the painters, then the decorators.

64
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,585
I nearly had kittens.

65
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:56,045
- Oh, Skip, this is great!

66
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,631
Real class, it's just what I wanted,

67
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,093
an exact replica of the
Golden Nugget in Las Vegas.

68
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,344
- Thank you, sir.

69
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,221
- Now, where's my brother?

70
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,223
- Upstairs in the den.

71
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,476
- All right.

72
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:13,314
- Ollie, explain to me how
you lose a 12-ton diesel rig!

73
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,691
Who leaves the motor running
when they take a leak?

74
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:19,737
Your ass, "everybody,”
look, find it, just find it.

75
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:21,988
Where the hell have you been

76
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,823
while the company's going
down the tubes, huh?

77
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,742
- I was out making show
business connections.

78
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,743
- Oh, yeah?

79
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,952
Well, try and remember,

80
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,121
there's a trucking business
that pays for this palace,

81
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,249
and that $3 bill secretary of yours, huh?

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,084
- Look, Goody, lay off Skip,

83
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,629
he's going to get me into the
right social circles out here.

84
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,672
- The right social
circle is back in Newark,

85
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,299
which is where we ought to be right now.

86
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,260
- All right, come on, don't
start this again, huh, Goody?

87
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,930
You know entertainment is in my blood.

88
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,515
Remember how I used to knock 'em dead

89
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,099
at family weddings with Volare?

90
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,351
- Vic, you were six years old.

91
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,602
If you finished your broccoli,

92
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,062
they gave you a standing ovation.

93
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,064
- Oh, come on, some people get their kicks

94
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,649
stomping on a dream.

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,193
- Look, Vic, I love you, I
don't want to see you get hurt,

96
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,362
but I gotta tell you, all
those scripts you wrote,

97
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,696
nobody's going to buy them.

98
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,157
A series about a pimp
called Munzio's Girls?

99
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,284
A soap opera called Bayone?

100
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,245
- All right, forget about art.

101
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,247
I wrote another one, very commercial,

102
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,207
it's called Sittin' Pretty, I know it,

103
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,834
I got this TV formula down now:

104
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,254
broads, boobs, horny guys,
sex jokes, the works.

105
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,922
This is really commercial, I mean it...

106
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,132
- Do what you want, I
don't care, but if you

107
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,718
don't sell something very
soon, we're going back home.

108
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,723
Hey, Uncle Vic!

109
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,393
- Hey, Rich.

110
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:36,396
- You mind if Bruno runs me
over to my aerobics class?

111
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,981
- Aerobics?

112
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,024
What the hell is happening to this family?

113
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,360
You've got one month!

114
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,737
- Yeah, okay, Richie, go ahead.

115
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,490
Thanks, Uncle Vic.

116
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,877
- Uh, well, you see, Ms.
Kester, I wouldn't be

117
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,546
calling at all except that
I'm a little desperate.

118
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,840
In my opinion, there's something wrong

119
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,551
with your whole rating system.

120
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,346
Now, our best summer series
is The Senator and Stinky,

121
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,390
and I just cannot imagine how

122
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,434
it could possibly have done that badly.

123
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,185
- Statistically, we are accurate

124
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,105
within a 2.2% margin of error.

125
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,858
- A zero share?

126
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,820
- Not one of the 1,500 Computron
sets were tuned into it.

127
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,072
In short, nobody watched.

128
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,574
- That's where you're wrong.

129
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,035
It just so happens, Ms. Kester,

130
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,038
that we received over 400 letters

131
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,248
from people complaining about the show,

132
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,542
so it's clear that somebody watched.

133
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,544
Well, none of
the Computron households.

134
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,756
- Households, see, now that's
the flaw in your system.

135
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,592
You don't take into account
college dormitories,

136
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,970
hospitals, prisons, we
get a lot of fan mail from

137
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,723
mental institutions, that
doesn't turn up in your ratings.

138
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,309
- Look, Mr. Braithwaite,
would you be complaining

139
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,394
if you had four shows in the top 10?

140
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,772
- No, Ms. Kester, I wouldn't,

141
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:04,359
because I'd be dead from the shock.

142
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,864
- Another happy customer.

143
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,289
Uh, Mr. Vandergelder,
did you read my report?

144
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,166
The one about the phone surveys

145
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,126
to augment the computer data?

146
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,171
- Oh, yes, yes, we'll get into that,

147
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,923
uh, Francine, but right now,

148
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,928
I'm in conference with Miss, uh, Conroy.

149
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,932
- Yes.

150
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,267
I wouldn't want to interrupt a conference

151
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,604
with the office receptionist.

I'm here tonight to

182
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,044
You know I must be talking
about the president

183
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,339
of MBC Entertainment,
Mr. Parker Braithwaite.

184
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,433
- It's gooseflesh time!

185
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,811
I don't know about you affiliates,

186
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,314
but I'm excited, because I've
seen the new fall lineup,

187
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,066
and I know that this is the year

188
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,360
that the MBC eagle

189
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,322
is really going to soar.

190
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,951
So now, without any further ado,

00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,621

By day, they're
swingin' sexy aerobics instructors

200
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,286
at a Santa Monica health
club known as H.O.T.B.O.D.S.

201
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,037
But, unknown to the public,

202
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,123
H.O.T.B.O.D.S. is a CIA code name,

203
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,167
for the Headquarters of the Bureau

204
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,918
of Organized Defense Security.

205
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,796
This elite force of
female intelligence agents

206
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,132
defends America from the forces of evil.

207
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,217
Along with their chauffeur bodyguard,

208
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,055
They're known as H.O.T.B.O.D.S. and Levar.

209
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,939
What happens when Gary can't
get into this man's army?

210
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,151
Well, he does the next best thing:

211
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,820
he joins this gal's army,

212
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,031
and becomes Wacked Out.

213
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,458
- Wacked Out is going to be a monster.

214
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,084
It tested through the roof.

215
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,294
- Tell them.

216
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,754
They're not laughing, Parker.

217
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,924
Yes, the laughs
are on us, and Uncle Sam!

218
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,303
In this new comedy from the
creators of I Got It Good,

219
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,264
it's Wacked Out!

220
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,936
Your funny bone will go AWOL.

221
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,149
And then, from the producers of Beer Nuts,

222
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,611

230
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,297
Jason, the rookie,

231

and Wexler, the poet.

- Oh, yeah, thank you.

252
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,080
Uh, yes, operator, this is Vic De Salvo.

253
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,124
You have a call from who?

254
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,254
Yes, I'll accept a call from Alan Alda.

255
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,882
Hello, Al, how are you?

256
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,134
Good, did you read the property?

257
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,137
You loved it, great.

258
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,639
Now, I realize that Albert Schweitzer

259
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,850
and Mother Teresa never really met,

260
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,269
but with you and Carol
Burnett in the leads,

261
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,397
CBS is very high on the project.

262
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,191
- Who's that De Salvo over there?

263
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,609
Anyone I should know?

264
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,819
- Bye-bye.

265
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,655
The bigger they are, the nicer they are.

266
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,951
Uh, excuse me.

267
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,161
-Yes?

268
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,871
- I forgot my glasses.

269
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,748
Is that a flaw?

270
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,625
- I wouldn't know.

271
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:21,838
- Oh, you don't get much
for 14 grand these days.

272
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,092
- Another telephone call
for you, Mr. De Salvo.

273
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,635
I'll ring it through.

274
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,429
- Huh, can you believe this?

275
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,391
When you're a big-time TV producer,

276
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,476
they never leave you alone.

277
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,315
Oh, fancy ring.

278
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,568

280
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,198
Oh, Johnny Carson.

281
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,952
Now what does he want?

282
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,578
- Hey, Vic, how you doing there?

283
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,788
Are they buying it?

284
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,040
- You got "em eating out
of the palm of your hand.

285
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,501
- I'll bet that Sylvester
Stallone calls you next.

286
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,961
I mean, I do a great Stallone.

287

Adriannnn!

288
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,965
- You're something.

289
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,509
All right, listen, Johnny,

290
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,344
well, all right, we'll play tennis, okay?

291
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,555
I promise I'll call, I will call you.

292
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,224
All right, bye-bye.

293
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:19,854
I saved his career once,
he never leaves me alone.

294
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:23,023
So, uh, are you girls actresses,

295
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,526
because I'm casting.

296
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,199
Who needs you?

297
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,707
- Your menu, Sir.

298
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,749
- Oh.

299
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,713
Thank you, uh, that's very delicious cake,

300
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,632
it's very light and moist.

301
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,139
- Mr. Friedlander, would you step

302
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
into Mr. Braithewait's
office for a minute?

303
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,423
- Frank, glad you could come, sit down.

304
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,841
Would you like some coffee?

305
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,052
Soda?

306
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,346
Well, let's get right down to brass tacks.

307
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,264
Frank, you know I'm
not one to mince words.

308
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,934
I have to let you go.

309
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,519
Sure, you're hurt,

310
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,605
but let's not forget that
The Senator and Stinky

311
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,650
was the lowest rated show in
the history of television.

312
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,443
I don't think I have to remind you

313
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,695
who touted that turkey.

314
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,949
Ah, but you still have your
job until five PM on Friday,

315
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,909
Frank, so feel free to use that time

316
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,911
to tie up any loose ends, and hey,

317
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,705
let's not say goodbye, let's just say,

318
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,250
so long.

319
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,794
Oh, and Frank, leave
the tape machine running

320
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,420
on your way out, yeah, thanks.

321
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,638
- Oh, come on, matey,
things can't be that bad.

322
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,641
Remember what we say on
the Captain Andy show,

323
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,978
"A smile is a frown turned upside down."

324
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,605
Haha, cheer up.

325
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,193
- Sit down, Captain Andy.

326
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:35,115
Captain, you have the
longest running show on MBC,

327
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,785
which is why what I
have to do now pains me.

328
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,996
- I'm telling you, I've got an appointment

329
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,289
with Mr. Friedlander.

330
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,832
- I'm sorry, your name's not down here.

331
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,083
- Well, look again!

332
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,167
- Hold on a second.

333
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,503
Front desk?

334
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,298
Yes, sir, Mr. Friedlander.

335
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,508
Mr. De Salvo's right here.

336
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,761
- So send him up, he's a
very important producer.

337
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,556
- Yes, sir, right away.

338
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,434
Go right ahead, Mr. De
Salvo, 20th floor, sir.

339
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,935
- Well, thank you very much,

340
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,854
and maybe next time, you'll remember me.

341
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,113
Friedlander, this is your lucky day.

342
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,156
- Who are you?

343
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,117
- The answer to your prayers.

344
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,494
All right, now here's the capper,

345
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,997
you're going to love this
scene, it's gonna kill you.

346
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,874
Chip is in the locker room

347
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,169
dressed in Kim's
cheerleading outfit, right,

348
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,715
he's got two basketballs
in his sweater for boobs!

349
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,009
Now, Kim can't come out of the shower

350
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,094
because Chip's wearing her clothes!

351
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,058
All right, now, that
ends the dream sequence.

352
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,354
Now, we flash back 20 years...

353
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,648
- Hold it, De Salvo.

354
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,067
I don't have to hear another word.

355
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,777
You don't like it?

356
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,071
- On the contrary,

357
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,614
I love it.

358
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,992
It's just what this network deserves,

359
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,620
and they're going to remember
me for giving it to them.

360
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,915
Business Affairs, please.

361
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,377
Vic, it is Vic?

362
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,045
- Yeah, yeah.

363
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:17,091
- Vic, I think we should
go to pilot on this.

364
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:21,221
How would you like a firm
on-the-air commitment?

365
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,726
- You should've seen me, boys.

366
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,939
I was brilliant, I was brilliant!

367
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,192
- MBC must be really hard up
to put that schlock on the air.

368
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,568
- Hey, lighten up, Goody.

369
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,320
- What's all the excitement?

370
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,406
- Skip, I sold my show.

371
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,949
We're going to have a big party

372
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,742
and I'm putting you in charge.

373
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,370
- Fabulous, I know just the caterer.

374
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,579
- What caterer?

375
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,581
I was planning on making
some scungilli calamaris

376
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,291
and have some cannolis afterwards.

377
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,753
- Please, please, this is an A-party.

378
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,213
- Uh, yeah, yeah, Skip,

379
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,881
I want you to draw up the guest list.

380
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,216
No lightweights.

381
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,136
- In that case, Chuck Heston is a must.

382
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,555
Then there's Dudley and Susan,

383
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,725
and we mustn't forget the Robert Stacks...

384
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,935
- Wait a minute, there's more than one?

385
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,235
You know, Richard, when
they talk about this party,

386
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,446
and they will talk about this party,

387
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,575
they'll all say this was
Skip Imperiali's finest hour.

388
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,453
You know, I was thinking
of seating the Jack Lemmons

389
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,872
and the Walter Matthaus at the same table.

390
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:33,459
Oh, you're right, it's too on
the nose, but enough glitter.

391
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,044
What we really need are
some studio honchos.

392
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,132
We can get Brandon Tartikoff
and Aaron Spelling...

393
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,096
- Ho ho, you are a delight, Wendy,

394
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,390
a real breath of fresh air.

395
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,018
- That means so much to me, Wes.

396
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,936
You know I really look up to you.

397
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,396
- So I've heard.

398
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,442
- Ah, working late again, Francine?

399
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:02,446
- You know, I really
admire your dedication.

400
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,032
I guess for me, having a personal life

401
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,533
is just too important.

402
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,203
- You seem to balance
them both pretty well.

403
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,788
- Let's go, Wendy.

404
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,081
Maybe we can finish our conference

405
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,292
over a rack of lamb at the Le Buff

406
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,253
and then see where we stand, huh?

407
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,798
Goodnight, Francine.

408
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,842
No working after midnight.

409
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,093
Come on.

410
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,443
- I thought this was an A party.

411
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,320
Not one guest is showing up.

412
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,072
- What are you complaining about?

413
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,825
- I gave up my acting class for this.

414
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,961
- Skip, what time you got?

415
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,671
- 10 o'clock.

416
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,974
- Nice party, boss.

417
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,601
- Yeah.

418
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,819
- Listen, Vic, where are all
the celebrites you promised?

419
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,490
- Hey, Skip, people will
be coming soon, right?

420
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,868
- Of course, sir, it's just that no one

421
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,078
wants to be the first to arrive.

422
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,082
- Great, meanwhile,
I've got a $400 ice swan

423
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,711
that's dripping into the chopped liver.

424
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,636
- Hi.

425
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,391
- Uncle Vic, Uncle Vic!

426
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,185
Someone's coming.

427
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:58,896
- See?

428
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,814
And you were worried, come on.

429
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,733
Come on, let's go over there.

430
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,861
- Hey, let's go see who it is, come on.

431
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,363
- You take it from Vic, baby.

432
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,116
You put out free food,
it attracts two things:

433
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,576
flies and actors.

434
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,994
Music, maestro!

435
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,996
- I bet it's Alan Alda,
he's so nice and polite,

436
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,289
he'd call if he couldn't make it.

437
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,709
- All right, waiters, on your toes,

438
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,962
push the shrimp balls.

439
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,089
- Did you see who it was?

440
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,675
You don't know who it was?

441
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,016
- Who's that?

442
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,560
- That must be Mrs. Alda.

443
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,648
Alan's probably throwing
the coats on the bed.

444
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,738
Um, hello, I'm Vic De Salvo.

445
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,408
Welcome to our soiree, Mrs., uh...

446
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,119
- Miss Francine Kester.

447
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,664
- Francine Kester?

448
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:02,542
Hey, everybody, Francine Kester's here.

449
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,920
- Who's that?

450
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:11,177
- So, um, where's your
important and influential date?

451
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,304
- Actually, I came alone.

452
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,639
- Alone?

453
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,101
I don't remember any Francine
Kester on the invite list.

454
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:20,519
Do you, Skip?

455
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,188
- Please, I have no
knowledge of this woman.

456
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,857
- You don't look like you've
had knowledge of any woman.

457
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,324
Look, uh, you know, I just
took my boss's invitation.

458
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,243
I thought the party might be fun.

459
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,995
You don't want me here,
fine, I'll go home.

460
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,539
- No, no, no, no, no, don't
go, don't go, come on,

461
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,040
come on, I like you.

462
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,792
Hey, a drink for the lady!

463
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,588
Come on, come on, all
right, all right, all right.

464
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,923
It's a guest.

465
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,301
All right, what are you
standing around for, mingle!

466
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,516
Hey, all right, one drink is enough.

467
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,435
Here you go.

468
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:01,518
- Thank you.

469
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,936
- Sheesh.

470
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,896
- Let's eat, there's a guest come,

471
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,356
let's get something to eat.

472
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,859
- I'm sorry that I blew up at you before,

473
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,277
but I'm a little edgy tonight.

474
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,611
- Oh, I can see why.

475
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,863
This party's a bomb.

476
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,657
- Hey, hey, hey, I like spunk in a woman,

477
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,743
but don't push your luck.

478
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,078
Have a shrimp ball.

479
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,289
All right, all right, at ease, at ease.

480
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,082
- I can't complain about the service.

481
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,250
- Yeah, it's the unions.

482
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,753
You hire one guy, you gotta
take his brothers with him.

483
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,797
Don't start me on unions here.

484
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,009
Park it over here, honey.

485
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,139
- Some place you got here.

486
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,974
- Yeah.

487
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,434
- You're not an Arab.

488
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,478
You must be a drug dealer.

489
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,397
- No, drug dealer?

490
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,983
No, I'm a TV producer.

491
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,443
- I was close.

492
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,529
So what do you do?

493
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,033
- I'm a statistician for the
Computron rating service.

494
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,285
- Hey, I heard of that.

495
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,411
- Yeah?

496
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,247
- Hey, Tamara, Miss Kester here

497
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,167
takes the ratings for the TV shows.

498
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,585
- How glamorous.

499
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,379
You must meet all kinds of
fascinating accountants.

500
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,301
Vic, can I talk to you
alone in private, please?

501
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,806
- Miss Kester, why don't
you go hit the buffet table?

502
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,809
If you want to take anything
home, we've got foil.

503
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,145
Go ahead, it's good.

504
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,568
- That is one of the big
celebrities you invited?

505
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,320
- Hey, the last time I looked,

506
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,072
you weren't exactly Meryl Streep.

507
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:40,075
- And I believed you when you
told me you were a producer.

508
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,953
My God, you can't even produce a party.

509
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,871
I thought you were
here because you like me,

510
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,249
not because you wanted
to meet celebrities.

511
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,001
- Oh, come on, Vic.

512
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,920
I mean, you have been around the block.

513
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,672
I mean, when was the last time

514
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,133
you saw a girl like me
with a guy like you,

515
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,551
because she liked him?

516
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,304
Oh, please, nice knowing you.

517
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,106
- Uh, well, feel better.

518
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,151
I'll call you later.

519
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,695
Hey, Bruno.

520
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,406
- Yeah, boss?

521
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,744
- Tamara has decided to dissolve

522
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,372
our relationship and go home

523
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,875
so I want you to go into the garage,

524
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,043
get out the Rolls Royce
and wing her with it,

525
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,587
make it look like an accident.

526
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,048
- I can't do that,
boss, it's my night off.

527
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,430
- She dumped on you, huh?

528
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,640
- No, no, Goody,

529
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,644
I told her that I wasn't
ready for a commitment.

530
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,773
- Vicky, have you noticed a
certain pattern in your life?

531
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,525
I mean, since you've got money,

532
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,652
all you do is go out with beautiful women

533
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,821
who treat you like dirt.

534
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,615
- It's a step up, I used to go out

535
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,742
with ugly women who treated me like dirt.

536
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,453
- What you need is a nice girl,

537
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,538
a girl who like you for
yourself, a girl who...

538
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,248
- That's not my type, huh.

539
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,959
- Who can talk to you?

540
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,051
- Vic, try some of this
pasta salad, it's delicious.

541
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,262
- Yeah, it's very tasty.

542
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,472
Well, help yourself,

543
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,225
there's another 600 pounds in the kitchen.

544
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:31,186
- Oh, don't feel bad.

545
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,522
Hey, it's really a lovely party.

546
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:35,607
-It is?

547
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,693
- Yeah, at least there's no
line at the buffet table.

548
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,529
And I've never gotten this
much attention in my life.

549
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,157
I mean, usually when I go to
one of these Hollywood parties,

550
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,451
there's so many glamorous women around,

551
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,994
nobody even notices me.

552
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,913
Tonight, they got no choice.

553
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,960
- I'm starting to notice you myself.

554
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:55,961
- Yeah?

555
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,754
- Yeah, where you from?

556
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:58,881
- Jersey.

557
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:00,841
- No.

558
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,092
- Yeah.

559
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,302
- You're from Jersey?

560
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,679
- I'm from Jersey.

561
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,097
- Hey, I'm from Jersey.

562
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,223
- No, really?

563
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,516
- Of course I'm from Jersey.

564
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,309
Hey, come on, I want
you to meet some people.

565
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,062
Hey, hey, boys,

566
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,439
we got a Jersey girl here.

567
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,525
Jersey, yeah, what part?

568
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,609
- Versailles.

569
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,860
- I got a road through over there.

570
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,028
You know the Musticandi Bakery?

571
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,280
- Are you kidding, I went to school

572
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,781
with the Musticandi boys.

573
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,075
- Yeah, hey, hey, Vic,

574
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,326
you've got a nice broad here.

575
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,120
- Bruno, didn't you learn anything

576
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,913
from the Women's Movement?

577
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,582
You're not supposed to say
broad in front of them.

578
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,126
I'm sorry, boss.

579
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,753
- Hey, Skip, more champagne,

580
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,755
bring out the good stuff this time.

581
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,090
Who would have figured,

582
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,718
this disaster's turning into a party!

583
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,344
- Hi, I'm Richie.

584
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,722
- I'm Bruno, this is my wife, Serafina.

585
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,931
- Hey, maestro!

586
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,726
You guys know Volare?

587
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,353
- Maybe I'll sing a tune.

588
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,298
- So, after Arthur went
back with his wife,

589
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,884
I started seeing Malcolm again.

590
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,344
- The dentist?

591
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,511
- No, no, no,

592
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,598
Malcolm sold white mice to laboratories.

593
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,600
- Oh.

594
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:37,396
- Yeah, he left me for an
older woman, his mother.

595
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,899
- You may find this hard to believe,

596
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,028
but my heart's been used as
a hockey puck a few times.

597
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,531
I guess you find that hard to believe.

598
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,701
- Not really, it's a
cruel world out there.

599
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,871
- Yeah, I've known
disillusionment and despair

600
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,040
and all those other cats.

601
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,125
- Vic, you have

602
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,544
such an interesting way
of talking, you know?

603
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,838
- Ah, I borrowed that from Frank,

604
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,258
he says it on his Man and His Music album.

605
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,138
You know, Francine, I really like you,

606
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,307
like, I feel like I can open up to you.

607
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,975
- That's sweet, Vic.

608
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,020
I guess that girl tonight
hurt you pretty bad, huh?

609
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,398
- Nah, that was one of
my healthy relationships.

610
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,108
At least she didn't torch my warehouse.

611
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,651
Some of them get vicious.

612
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,489
- Well,

613
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,158
we're here, this is where I live.

614
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,576
- Oh, geez,

615
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,870
oh, 4:30.

616
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,580
- What?
- We talked all night.

617
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,750
- Oh, my God, it's like it just flew by.

618
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:41,751
- Yeah.

619
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,337
- So you want to come up for some coffee?

620
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,134
- Uh, no, no, I think I better
take a rain check on that

621
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,511
because I've got a lot
of appointments tomorrow.

622
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,013
- I understand, no problem.

623
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,517
- No, you don't understand,
I had a great time.

624
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,686
- You don't have to say that, Vic.

625
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,729
- I know I don't have to say that.

626
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,567
I'm saying it, that I like
you, I want to see you again.

627
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,318
- So I'll hear from you?

628
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,864
- Yeah, yeah, we'll go
to a movie or something,

629
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,031
I'll call you.

630
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,200
- Great.

631
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,912
- So, goodnight.

632
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,247
- Goodnight.

633
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,345
- What happened, boss, you didn't score?

634
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,347
- Oh, of course I didn't score.

635
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,766
This is an intelligent
and sensitive woman,

636
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,769
she doesn't have casual sex
with every guy she meets.

637
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,439
- That's too bad, we'll find
you one that's your type.

638
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,651
- Yeah, Francine's different.

639
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,237
You know, Bruno, I never knew I could have

640
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,198
so much fun with a girl standing up.

641
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,200
- Well, you know, sometimes, boss,

642
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,953
you can't build a relationship
on just relating...

643
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,874
- Yeah, you got a point there.

644
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,127
- All right.

645
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,318
- God,

646
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,654
the De Salvo script sucks.

647
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,739
I can't believe
Friedlander did that to me.

648
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,158
We've always had such a
close personal relationship.

649
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,369
- It's called revenge.

650
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,454
- Yeah, well, why couldn't
he just steal office supplies

651
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:42,664
like everybody else?

652
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,707
- Well, we're stuck with it.

653
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,252
If we don't air that show,
he could sue us for millions.

654
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:50,213
- But that's crap, we
can't put that on the air.

655
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,757
- Never stopped us before.

656
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,841
- True.

657
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,427
- What do you know, don't tell me,

658
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,804
I'm an Emmy-winning director,

659
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,973
I ain't gonna take any of
this crap from anybody.

660
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:03,644
- Ah, who needs you, I'll
direct this pilot myself.

661
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,106
All right, take it from the top,

662
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,692
with feeling, come on.

663
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,655
- Hi, girls.

664
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,991
- Who are you?

665
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:21,244
- I'm your, uh, roommate.

666
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,871
- No, no, no, no, Steve, look,

667
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,832
you're playing this too white bread.

668
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,251
I mean, you gotta think of
what you're playing here.

669
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,628
You just fell into pussy.

670
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,214
I mean, you walk into a room,
you don’t come in like a wimp,

671
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,217
you strut, you use a little body English.

672
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,636
You see a set of twin hooters like that,

673
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,430
you go, Marone!

674
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:43,850
- Vic, I'm playing a guy
named Chip Wainwright,

675
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,643
he's a student at Princeton.

676
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,437
- Well, where do you think Princeton is?

677
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,397
It's in New Jersey, don't tell me

678
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,317
how people talk from Jersey.

679
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,944
Ooh.

680
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:57,072
What's he getting so upset about?

681
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,366
All right, listen, girls,

682
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,828
Steve is leaving the company
due to artistic differences.

683
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,080
In other words, he stunk on ice.

684
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,126
Uh, I have decided

685
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,672
to step into the role of Chip Wainwright.

686
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,924
Great.

687
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,219
- So tomorrow, be here
at 10 o'clock sharp.

688
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,513
Okay.

689
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,143
- Hey, Vic?

690
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,353
- Yeah?

691
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,771
- I think you did the best thing.

692
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,316
Steve's performance was hurting
the integrity of the piece.

693
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,859
- You really think so?

694
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,943
- Yeah.

695
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,571
- Well, that's really
nice of you to say, Stacy,

696
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,699
I'm glad somebody understands me.

697
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,078
Look, how about if you and I, uh,

698
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,873
we go out tonight and unwind?

699
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,416
- I'd love to, Vic.

700
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,544
There's just one small
thing I have to do first.

701
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,837
- Yeah?

702
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,006
- Well, I have to break up with Steve,

703
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,510
but that should take about a half hour.

704
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,553
Why don't you pick me up at 9:007?

705
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,180
- Yeah, alright.

706
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,183
- Okay, bye.

707
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,409
Hello, stranger,

708
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,120
this is your mother in New Jersey.

709
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:30,958
It's costing me $2 to speak to a machine.

710
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,460
So, are you seeing anybody?

711
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,463
You don't have that many
child-bearing years left,

712
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:41,259
you know, I'd like to see some
grandchildren before I die,

713
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,637
which could be any day,
the way I'm feeling.

714
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:48,016
Anyway, have a nice evening.

715
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,362
- What a great idea, Vic.

716
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,281
The Santa Monica pier.

717
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,949
- Yeah, I come here all the time,

718
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,492
reminds me of back home.

719
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,662
You ever hear of Palisades
Park in New Jersey?

720
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,956
- No, I'm from West Covena.

721
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:12,791
- Yeah.

722
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,500
- Aren't you a little chilly?

723
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,252
- Oh, I love the cold weather.

724
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,172
They used to sing the song,
Palisades has the rides,

725
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,965
Palisades has the fun,

726
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,426
come on over, you know?

727
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,802
- Real catchy tune.

728
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,264
Hey, why don't we go
to the Hard Rock Cafe?

729
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,224
- What for, they don't have skee ball.

730
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,185
I'll spot you 100 points.

731
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,645
Hey, you want a chocolate banana?

732
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,815
Come on, I'll buy you a chocolate banana.

733
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,487
Uh, let me have two,
two chocolate bananas.

734
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:45,198
- Vic, I just remembered.

735
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,283
You want us off the book tomorrow, right?

736
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,451
- Yeah.

737
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,746
- Well, I'm still a little
shaky on that second act.

738
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,415
You'd better take me home.

739
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,336
- Yeah, I guess I better.

740
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,095
Francine?

741
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,515
Francine!

742
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:12,225
Hit the horn again, Bruno.

743
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,814
Francine?

744
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,399
- Vic, what do you want?

745
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,527
- I've got to ask you
something, it's very important.

746
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:23,611
What?

747
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,154
- Do you know the words

748
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,824
to the Palisades Park theme song?

749
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,034
- Wait a minute, you don't
call me for two weeks

750
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,828
and you wake me up in
the middle of the night

751
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,162
and ask me if I know the words

752
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,914
to the Palisades Park theme song?

753
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,541
- No, come on, do you know them?

754
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,294
- What the Sam Hill's going
on out there, keep it down!

755
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:43,381
- Palisades has the rides,
Palisades has the fun,

756
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,466
come on over,

757
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,385
there's fun and dancing for free

758
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,679
so is the parking, so gee, come on over.

759
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,888
- That's it!

760
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,265
So?

761
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,850
- So I think I love you.

762
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,561
Now go to bed.

763
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,564
Goodnight, I'll call you, I'll call you!

764
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,362
- The man is crazy.

787
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,966
to a brand new pilot from
MBC called Sittin' Pretty.

788
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,468
This will make you forget all
the great shows of the past,

789
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,887
uh, thank you, we're going
to have that sound check now

790
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,431
we spoke about, so on three,
please, give me the titter.

791
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,933
One, two, three.

792
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,269
Polite, polite, that's nice.

793
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,814
Now, on three, give me the
medium laugh, one, two, three.

794
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,861
Okay, now the big one we need,
the big laugh for America,

795
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,947
you ready, now.

796
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,463
- Kids, gypsies,

797
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,800
we have reached that moment
of truth in the theater:

798
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,593
opening night.

799
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,888
Those good people across the footlights

800
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,349
will tell us whether we're a hit

801
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,643
or a flop.

802
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,980
But either way, I want
you's to know that it was

803
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,735
grand working with this
merry troupe of minstrels.

804
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,405
Actors, let's go to work.

805
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,241
All right!

806
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,706
- Vic, that was a beautiful speech,

807
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,374
really inspiring.

808
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,836
What's the matter?

809
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,505
- I gotta throw up.

810
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,427
♪ Well, he's got what he wants

811
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,722
♪ Well, he's loving the life he's got

812
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:23,017
♪ Well, he's having a ball,
yeah, he's getting it all

813

815

♪ Sittin' pretty, wow, look at that hair

816
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,407
♪ Sittin' pretty, that's
really pretty pride

817
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,411
♪ Sittin' pretty

818
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,290
♪ That's right ♪

819
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,717
- Isn't this exciting, Kim?

820
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,385
Our first day in college.

821
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,553
- Yeah.

822
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,722
There's supposed to be three
girls sharing this room.

823
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,390
Where's our other roommate?

824
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,727
- Well, hey, this looks
like her trunk right here.

825
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,897
The name tag says "H. Wainwright."

826
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,733
I hope she's nice.

827
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,030
- Marone!

828
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:29,166
Hiya, dolls,

829
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,170
I'm your roommate, Hubble
Wainwright the third,

830
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,132
but you can call me Chip.

831
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:39,760
- Wait a minute, fella, we're
expecting a girl roommate.

832
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,555
- I know.
- Yo, Vic!

833
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,390
-Isn't it a hoot?

834
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:47,768
If mommy and daddy could see me now,

835
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,062
they'd toss their cookies.

836
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:58,362
- This guy is a hunk.

837
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:01,241
- By the way, roomies,

838
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,785
where do I sleep?

839
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:13,294
- Wait a minute, Misty, don't
say what you're thinking.

840
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,924
- So this is what they mean

841
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,760
when they say student body.

842
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,810
Sorry, Dean Molburn,

843
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,897
I guess we learned an
important lesson today.

844
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,691
Honesty is the best policy.

845
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:41,030
- And to think, I have to
contend with this nutty trio

846
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,781
for another four years!

847
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,248
♪ He's sittin' pretty

848
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,008
♪ Sittin' pretty, all right

849
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,720
♪ Sittin' pretty, all right

850
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,848
♪ Sittin' pretty

851
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,809
♪ That's right ♪

852
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,688
- All right, Richie, Dawn,
very nice meeting you,

853
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,398
good luck with the rock videos.

854
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,485
- Boffo, Mr. De Salvo, absolutely boffo.

855
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:20,486
- Boffo.

856
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,032
All right, Goody, thank you, I'm glad,

857
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,450
it's real important that you liked it.

858
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,952
- I loved it, I've never laughed so hard.

859
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:29,161
- All right, all right.

860
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,246
- I'll see you at the house.

861
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,247
- I'll see you.

862
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,375
- God.

863
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:35,919
Worst pilot ever.

864
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:40,966
This tops that sitcom
we did Efrem Zimbalist.

865
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:49,014
- Well, gentlemen, tonight
we wrote a new chapter

866
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,142
in the annals of show business history.

867
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,936
- You could say that.

868
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,855
- The only concern I
have is being tied down

869
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,566
to a hit show for eight or nine years.

870
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,736
So when do we go on the air?

871
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,113
- Well, we were just talking about that.

872
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:06,865
It's going to be a Tuesday
evening in October.

873
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,826
The 9:00 timeslot.

874
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,911
9:00?

875
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:14,290
That's good, we get the
oldsters, we get the youngsters,

876
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,959
I like that time slot,
what's our competition?

877
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,461
- Oh, nothing much,

878
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,755
just the World Series.

879
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,926
- The World Series?

880
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,386
Yeah, the World Series.

881
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,305
- But nobody will watch the show!

882
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,682
- No, you really think so?

883
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,101
It can't be true!

884
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,688
Come on, you gotta
give our show a chance!

885
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:38,939
- We are.

886
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,275
All you have to do is

887
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:44,153
beat the World Series in the ratings.

888
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:02,964
- Deep breaths, Vic, take little breaths.

889
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,416
- Geez.

890
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,002
Do you believe that?

891
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,546
- Drink your wine, Vic,
you'll feel better.

892
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,466
- I don't know, Francine, I
don't know what's wrong with me.

893
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,552
Why can't I command any
respect in this town?

894
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,262
- Oh, that's not true, Vic,

895
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,807
a lot of people think very highly of you.

896
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:56,600
- Maybe Goody's right,

897
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,435
maybe I don't belong in show business.

898
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,687
- Come on, now, that
doesn't sound like you.

899
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,690
The man who took one
You-Hauler and turned it

900
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,235
into the second largest trucking
business in the country?

901
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,153
- But that was different, Francine,

902
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,615
I was dealing with
thugs, hitmen, and goons.

903
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,992
These network guys are scary.

904
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,786
- Vic, cheer up.

905
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,663
I'll watch your show.

906
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,207
- Ah, great.

907
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,918
Then all I need is a
hundred million more people

908
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,670
to beat the World Series.

909
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,088
- It's not true.

910
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:29,425
You can have a big hit in TV
with only 100 people watching,

911
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:31,177
if they're the right people.

912
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,265
- Is that right?

913
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,769
Tell me more.

914
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:45,441
So you're telling me that 1,500 families

915
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,818
control the whole ratings deal?

916
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,820
Yeah, well, you
know it's very scientific,

917
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:53,533
like, one ratings family
represents 100,000 homes.

918
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:58,078
- So, in other words, if you was

919
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,915
to persuade these people
to watch your show,

920
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,459
you'd be in.

921
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,169
- I like that word, persuade, boss.

922
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,297
Remember the teamster election of '74?

923
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:09,715
- Yeah.

924
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,300
- Forget about it, Vic.

925
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,385
I mean, these people have to report

926
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:15,513
anyone who tries to influence them.

927
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,223
- Yeah, but suppose they didn't know

928
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,601
they were being influenced.

929
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:23,604
- But the names of these
people are top secret.

930
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,065
Even the CIA couldn't get a hold of them.

931
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:31,111
- Yeah, well, the CIA isn't going steady

932
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:34,115
with the girl wonder of
the ratings business.

933
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,910
- Stop the car!

934
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,661
- Whoa, what's going on over there?

935
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:45,210
- Francine, come on, get back in the car!

936
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,047
- I thought you cared about me.

937
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,507
- I do, I do.

938
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:54,343
What, do I have to hurl
myself off a hill to prove it?

939
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:57,889
- You just want to use me
to advance your career.

940
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,893
- I think I just tripped over a dead elk.

941
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:05,521
I'm from Newark, what am
I doing on a mountain?

942
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:07,397
- Leave me alone, I'm going home.

943
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,899
- She's going home.

944
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,109
You're going to need
a parachute from here.

945
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,695
Francine, I'm liable to
step on a snake here.

946
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,532
- Don't worry, they never
bite their own kind.

947
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:19,576
- Francine, forget what I said.

948
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,120
I was only kidding, where are you going?

949
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,665
Oh, oh, oh, my God.

950
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:27,918
- You've been lying to me from the start,

951
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,711
setting me up for this.

952
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,839
- Hey, I didn't make a
move on you for four dates.

953
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,592
If that's not love, I don't know what is.

954
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,804
Ay, Marone, where we going?

955
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,305
Francine.

956
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:43,141
- True love is not using,

957
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,310
love is caring

958
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,355
and helping and sharing.

959
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:51,526
- Well, love is not climbing
and falling, either.

960
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,237
We gotta get out of here,
they'll never find us,

961
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:56,823
I got no flares on me.

962
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:59,617
Come on, Francine.

963
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:04,705
Look, I apologize, come back to the car.

964
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:06,082
- Don't touch me.

965
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,044
I thought you were different.

966
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,006
You're like all the rest.

967
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,092
- Look, I know you been hurt,

968
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,304
but not every guy is trying to use you.

969
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:21,972
At least, not this guy.

970
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,101
- How do I know?

971
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:29,230
- Come on, come here.

972
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,486
Sit here, sit down.

973
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,530
Sit down.

974
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,743
Look,

975
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,580
would you forgive me?

976
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:51,001
Because I was temporarily blinded

977
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,087
by those lights down there.

978
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,132
See, all I ever wanted
was to be part of that,

979
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,844
but I would never hurt you to get it.

980
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:03,973
- I know.

981
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:07,018
I'm sorry I over-reacted.

982
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,772
- Let's never fight again, all right?

983
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,114
- So this is what they write about

984
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,158
in all those women's magazines, huh?

985
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,410
- What's that?

986
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,121
- The big O.

987
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:31,416
- Oh, all right, let's do this right here.

988
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,423
Well, I'm going to get all dirty here.

989
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,717
- That's the idea.

990
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,892
- May I have your attention please?

991
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,811
I have an announcement to make.

992
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:54,106
I want you all to say
hello to Wendy Conroy,

993
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:56,817
our new head of marketing research.

994
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,997
- You have been promising
me that job for 11 years,

995
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,541
and then you give it to a broad

996
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:15,127
who has seen more ceilings
that Michelangelo.

997
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:16,294
- When?

998
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,296
When did I promise?

999
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:21,925
- Every Christmas, instead of a bonus,

1000
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,510
but I guess Wendy got it

1001
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,387
because she had a great overnight rating.

1002
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:28,932
- Look, in lieu of a promotion,

1003
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,560
how about your own parking spot,

1004
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,980
directly adjacent to the handicap space?

1005
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,901
- How about doing to yourself
what you normally do to Wendy?

1006
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,323
- This is a gold mine, Sweeney,

1007
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:11,076
Foley, Johnson, Sawyer,

1008
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:14,538
Miller, Brown, Nelson, Calbot,
Applebee, Olsen, Bailey,

1009
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,290
Rutherford, I didn't know people
really had names like that.

1010
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,876
- I selected only
families in key precincts.

1011
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,127
You get them all to watch,

1012
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,630
you got the highest
rated show of the year.

1013
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:25,841
- Baby, you're a genius.

1014
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:28,301
- But nobody's going to get hurt, right?

1015
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,555
- Oh, no, no, au contraire,

1016
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:34,766
these people are going to
have the time of their lives.

1017
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,393
- What do you mean by that?

1018
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,103
- You'll see.

1019
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:41,231
Goody, tomorrow I want
you to call the boys

1020
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,732
all over the country.

1021
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,652
We're going to have a little meeting.

1022
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,548
- Ah, gentlemen, come in, come in.

1023
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:07,924
Welcome, welcome.

1024
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,510
Right this way, please.

1025
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,138
The bar is on your right,

1026
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:16,349
and I trust you know these
other gentlemen here.

1027
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,560
- Hey, Bruno, what's going on?

1028
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:20,145
Somebody die or what?

1029
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,771
- I don't know, he won't even tell me.

1030
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,940
I guess it's going to
be something important

1031
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,276
for him to bring all the boys in.

1032
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,279
- Oh, no, no, Richie, put it over there.

1033
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,866
- Hey Goody, am I nuts or
have I been here before?

1034
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,660
- The lobby of the Golden Nugget.

1035
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,829
- Classy!

1036
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,999
- Thank you very much.

1037
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:43,878
- All right, all our boys.

1038
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,464
All right, now.

1039
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:53,762
I am offering you a piece
of one of the biggest

1040
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:57,182
money-making rackets in America today.

1041
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,391
- Drugs?

1042
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,684
- Hookers?

1043
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,144
- Car insurance?

1044
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:04,522
- No, no, no, no, television,

1045
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:08,568
where a minute of
advertising costs $100,000,

1046
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,949
and one rating point is worth
$40 million to a network.

1047
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,993
- You've got our undivided attention.

1048
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,997
- And, do you know who
controls this whole racket?

1049
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,917
1,500 families.

1050
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:27,545
- So boys, D-Day is the 14th of October.

1051
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:30,048
On that day, we've arranged
for a number of these families

1052
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,591
to be out of their houses.

1053
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,009
- So what do you need us for?

1054
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,844
- While they're away,

1055
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,223
we are providing a little
house-sitting service.

1056
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,642
This is where your boys come in.

1057
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:43,728
They're gonna go in and
take care of things,

1058
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,147
water the plants,

1059
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,317
maybe watch a little TV.

1060
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,111
- Let me get this straight, Vic,

1061
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:54,447
you want me and my
truckers to break and enter

1062
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,950
into the homes of innocent people

1063
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,203
and help you perpetuate this fraud?

1064
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,788
- Yeah.

1065
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,498
- I got no problem with that.

1066
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:07,627
- How the hell you
gonna get 1,500 families

1067
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,087
out of their houses?

1068
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:10,547
- We only need to get rid

1069
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,966
of 100 families in the key precincts.

1070
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:16,803
- We're sending them on a
little cruise, curtains.

1071
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:18,388
- You got it, unc.

1072
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:23,476
- This is like in school, right?

1073
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,604
You remember Sister
Allawicius, whack on your hand.

1074
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,315
All right, it's going up.

1075
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:35,530
Here you see our luxury cruise ship.

1076
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,574
- It looks like a garbage scow.

1077
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,784
What did you do, raise the Andrea Doria?

1078
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,579
- After we fix it up, they'll
swear it's the Queen Mary.

1079
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,123
- Richie, next slide.

1080
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:50,378
This is the continental United States.

1081
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:53,173
Let us start with the Midwest.

1082
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:56,010
Tony, that is your territory.

1083
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,285
- Honey, kids!

1084
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,787
A cruise!

1085
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,497
- Oh, Harold, a cruise!

1086
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,416
Kids, hurry!

1087
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,549
- Honey, honey!

1088
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,391
- Dear, look here.

1089
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,403
- Come along, fellas,
quickly, quickly, now,

1090
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,738
quickly, quickly.

1091
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:01,574
Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone,

1092
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,744
Tyrone, I mean, I was
going for '30s deco here.

1093
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:07,705
Remember Fred and Ginger
in Shall We Dance?

1094
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,542
I mean, Tyrone, do you
call that egg shell white?

1095
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:12,961
It's throwing off my whole color scheme.

1096
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:14,421
Please, Tyrone.

1097
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,259
- Oh, Francine, after last night,

1098
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,886
when Webster defines the word ecstasy,

1099
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,848
he's gonna have to put our
picture in the dictionary.

1100
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,978
Ooh, such language, I love
it when you talk like that.

1101
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,437
Oh, Francine...

1102
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,730
- Vic, I gotta talk to you.

1103
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,483
- Uh, look, honey, I'll
call you back, Goody's here.

1104
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,901
All right, I love you.

1105
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,155
Bye-bye.

1106
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:40,738
What, what is it?

1107
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,158
- Look at these bills, this
scam of yours is killing us!

1108
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,410
- Just think of it as an
investment in the future.

1109
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,037
- Okay, genius, a week from today,

1110
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,747
a hundred families are showing up

1111
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,082
for a cruise on the Love Boat,

1112
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,625
they're expecting to see TV stars.

1113
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:53,668
-So?

1114
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,795
A little help, Uncle Vic?

1115
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,422
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, Richie.

1116
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:59,257
So where are
we gonna get TV stars?

1117
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:02,218
- Look, Goody, Goody,
just relax, will you?

1118
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,053
- They're expecting to see celebrities.

1119
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,848
- Don't worry about
it, I got just the guy.

1120
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,225
He's gonna be available soon.

1121
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,477
- Thanks, Uncle Vic!

1122
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,776
- Well, boys and girls, it's
Captain Andy's final show.

1123
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,739
Yep, the network has relieved
the Captain of his command.

1124
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,533
Yes, they're giving him the shift.

1125
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:28,996
Yep, after 23 years in this studio.

1126
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,248
And there is a lesson
in that, boys and girls,

1127
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,334
and you know what that lesson is?

1128
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:37,295
Yeah, do it to them
before they do it to you!

1129
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:41,049
Now, how about singing our theme song?

1130
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,300
Are you ready?

Bye-bye, kids, nice knowing you.

1139
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,283
- Oh, you know, Captain Andy,

1140
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,411
I watched your show ever
since I was a little boy,

1141
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:11,913
I always admired it, I can't believe

1142
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,706
that they took you off the air.

1143
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,375
- That's show-biz, son.

1144
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,877
Two daytime Emmys and you're history.

1145
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,462
- Yeah, yeah, well look,

1146
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,297
I've got a little proposition for you,

1147
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,132
you might like it, it pays good money.

1148
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,885
All you gotta do is sign a few autographs

1149
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,428
and shake a few hands.

1150
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:30,014
- As long as the check
clears, he'll do anything!

1151
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,432
Salty, shut up.

1152
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:32,892
You shut up.

1153
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:34,560
I should have done most of the talking

1154
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:35,645
equitable but all right.

1155
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:36,896
Ah, shut up, I'm talking.

1156
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:40,149
- Yeah, yeah.

1157
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:00,545
- Mom, I don't want to go on the cruise,

1158
01:04:00,546 --> 01:04:02,422
I'm going to miss the
World Series tonight.

1159
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:05,133
- I'm sure there will be a TV on board.

1160
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,175
- But Mom...

1161
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,427
- Are you aware of that
helicopter, mister?

1162
01:04:07,428 --> 01:04:08,636
- Don't we get a ticket?

1163
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:09,762
- No, no, it'll be okay.

1164
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,890
- Mr. and Mrs. Foley, welcome aboard.

1165
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,145
You'll be on B deck, cabin four.

1166
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,982
Have a nice cruise.

1167
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,569
Oh, the Sweeneys,

1168
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,113
C-deck, cabin 22.

1169
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,991
- Oh, this doesn't look like
the real Love Boat to me.

1170
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:33,328
Where's the real Love Boat
crew, Doc, Isaac, Gopher?

1171
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:34,370
Where are they?

1172
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,788
- We fed 'em to the sharks

1173
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,415
and that's what we're going to do to you!

1174
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,624
- Mom!

1175
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,585
- Don't worry, he's only kidding.

1176
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,087
That little shit.

1177
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:17,580
Well, there's
an air of electricity tonight

1178
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,582
at the South Bronx as the home champions

1179
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,417
take on the big blue wreckin' crew.

1180
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,669
Yes, I can't imagine a home in America

1181
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,963
that isn't tuned into this drama tonight.

1182
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,135
Play ball!

1183
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:19,600
- There's no TV set on the ship.

1184
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,768
What are we going to do tonight?

1185
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,478
I can't even watch the World Series.

1186
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,022
- I think we can do without television.

1187
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:27,650
After all, it's only one weekend, Todd.

1188
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:28,818
- We all can.

1189
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,112
It would be good for us.

1190
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,365
- Well, what are we gonna
do if we can't watch TV?

1191
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,868
- Well, we could talk to each other,

1192
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,828
get to know one another.

1193
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,705
- Yeah, Mr. Johnson's right.

1194
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,665
We don't need television, let's just, uh,

1195
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,293
have a conversation.

1196
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:04,061
- Did anyone see Dynasty last week?

1197
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,605
- Yes, yes.

1198
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:08,566
- Oh, did you believe
what Lexus did to Crystal?

1199
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,860
Isn't she a slut?

1200
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,695
Now we're all
tied up with two apiece.

1201
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,822
Dave Winfield trying to
get the Yankees out in front.

1202
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,783
Three balls, two strikes,
the windup, the delivery,

1203
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,453
and Winfield fouls it
up into the upper deck.

1204
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:23,207
- Come on, Winfield, earn your money.

1205
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,375
- Hey, it's 9:00, we
gotta turn on Vic's show.

1206
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,627
- Turn off the game now?

1207
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:28,794
What, are you nuts?

1208
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,379
- That's what Vic's paying us for.

1209
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:34,134

it's hit deep, deep, oh...

- Ha, look at this, huh?

1216
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,345
I'm a natural actor.

1217
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,681
I know, isn't it a hoot?

1218
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:23,392
- Why aren't you laughing?

1219
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,812
- I don't feel good about this, Vic.

1220
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:29,773
- Ah, come on, look at this.

1221
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,985
- This guy is a hunk.

1222

- Hey, this broad can act.

1223

By the way, roomies,

where do I sleep?

1225
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:49,375
I guess we learned an
important lesson today:

1226
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:52,295
honesty is the best policy.

1227
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,047
- All right, I'm glad that's over.

1228
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,382
Now let's get back to the game.

1229
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:59,093

01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,477
Well, if you just tuned in,

1233
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,479
you missed the play of the century,

1234
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,232
I want to tell you, yes indeedy-doody.

1235
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,488
- Good morning, Trish.

1236
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,992
- Parker, the colonel's in there.

1237
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,877
- The colonel, chairman of the board?

1238
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:33,879
Yes.

1239
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,882
- Well, that's it.

1240
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,885
It was fun while it lasted.

1241
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,309
Colonel, what brings you here to...

1242
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:53,023
- I'm waiting for Parker Braithewait.

1243
01:09:55,651 --> 01:10:00,529
- Uh, colonel, I'm Parker Braithewait.

1244
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,783
Remember, we met last
year when you hired me?

1245
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:06,911
- God, you've aged, son.

1246
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:08,621
You know Buster.

1247
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,206
- Sure, sure, of course I do.

1248
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:11,749
Hello, Buster.

1249
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:19,090
- Well, if you have seen
the overnight ratings,

1250
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:20,716
you know why I'm here.

1251
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,386
- Uh, colonel, it's easy to
single me out on this one,

1252
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,429
but there are plenty of others

1253
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,431
who should share the responsibility.

1254
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:29,850
- Listen to that.

1255
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,687
He pulls off the programming
coup of the year,

1256
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:34,522
hell, the decade,

1257
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:37,525
and he modestly shares credit with others.

1258
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:39,903
There's a lesson in that, Buster.

1259
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,073
- Programming coup?

1260
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:54,792
De Salvo got a 60 share?

1261
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:01,340
- Half of America tuned
out the World Series

1262
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,092
to watch that little wop.

1263
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,886
- Well, I knew it would be good,

1264
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,931
I just, I never dreamed these numbers.

1265
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,683
- Yeah, think about
what it'll be next week

1266
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:12,143
when there's no competition!

1267
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:15,980
- But colonel, that was just a pilot,

1268
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,314
we wanted to see how it would go

1269
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,941
before we went rushing into series.

1270
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,819
- It's officially a series, Braithwaite.

1271
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:25,573
Episode number two airs in six days.

1272
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:28,409
Do I make myself clear?

1273
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,870
Clear?

1274
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:42,090
- Oh, Mr. De Salvo.

1275
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,843
Always good to see you, sir.

1276
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:49,305
Mr. Braithwaite's waiting
for you at table one.

1277
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:50,766
This way, please.

1278
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,562
- Well, hey, buddy, good to see you,

1279
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:59,106
I was getting a little
worried, you're an hour late.

1280
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,274
-Am I?

1281
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:04,278
William, a bottle of
Chateau Margaux '61, please.

1282
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,030
- Excellent, sir.

1283
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:10,159
- Now look, Vic, I'm willing
to eat a little humble pie here

1284
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:14,664
and give you an order for six shows.

1285
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,876
- I'm Sicilian and we
never discuss business

1286
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:20,503
until after we've eaten.

1287
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:23,297
William, what's your bill of fare today?

1288
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:26,300
- We have several
specials today, gentlemen.

1289
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:27,384
- Specials?

1290
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:31,222
- Scampi palermo, tiny baby prawns

1291
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:33,933
gently sauteed in a fine...

1292
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:37,561
I don't mean to rush you, Vic,

1293
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:41,107
but it is your third cup of espresso.

1294
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,194
State your case.

1295
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,278
- Fine.

1296
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:50,407
I'll give you 13 weeks, firm.

1297
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,785
- Not so fast.

1298
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:54,745
I want production offices.

1299
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,123
I want six on-the-air commitments.

1300
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,920
I want a back-ended
syndication deal, up front.

1301
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,632
- All right, anything you want.

1302
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:07,883
What do you say?

1303
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,845
- I don't know, I'll sleep on it.

1304
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:14,265
- Vic, Vic, Vic, Vic, I'm on my knees!

1305
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:16,851
Don't refuse a man on his knees!

1306
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:18,937
- Will that be cash or charge, sir?

1307
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,617
- Did your order one sex maniac?

1308
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,286
- Vic, what are you doing here?

1309
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:37,788
I told you we shouldn't be
seen together for a while.

1310
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:41,292
- What, what, what are
you so nervous about here?

1311
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:45,045
Here, here, here, check out these goodies

1312
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,675
that I picked up at the
House of Kinky on Sepulveda.

1313
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:51,844
A glow-in-the-dark brassiere.

1314
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,888
Not tonight,
Vic, I'm too tense.

1315
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,098
- Well, then, you're in good hands,

1316
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,142
because I'm a licensed pervert.

1317
01:13:58,143 --> 01:13:59,768
- I don't believe you came here.

1318
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,329
You could have been tailed by the feds.

1319
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,564
- Tailed by the feds?

1320
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:05,482
What am I, Dillinger?

1321
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,694
- Oh, I am just glad that
those families are docking

1322
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,195
and coming home tonight,

1323
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,407
maybe I'm going to finally
get a good night's sleep.

1324
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,577
-Um.

1325
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:20,581
I think there's something
that you should know.

1326
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:21,875
- What?

1327
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:27,671
- Sittin' Pretty got
picked up for 22 weeks.

1328
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,839
-So?

1329
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,801
- So, if I let those people come home

1330
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,889
and they don't watch my
show, it'll get canceled.

1331
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:45,105
- Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

1332
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,982
- What choice did I have?

1333
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:53,948
- Hello, passengers, this is
your old Captain Andy speaking.

1334
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:56,283
Good news, gang, your dream cruise

1335
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,202
aboard the Love Boat has been extended

1336
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:01,455
for 22 fabulous, fun-filled weeks.

1337
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:04,333
Next stop, Cancun, Mexico!

1338
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:05,709
Olé!

1339
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,127
- For crying out...

1340
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,922
- What's he talking about?

1341
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,634
- 22 weeks, why aren't we docking?

1342
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:15,386
- Hey, I have to be at work tomorrow!

1343
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:16,595
- Turn this ship around!

1344
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,430
- Mellow out, people.

1345
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,684
- |I don't care what anybody
says, I'm going on that life boat.

1346
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,602
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1347
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,688
- What are we doing here, cane mutiny?

1348
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,857
- Hold it, ain't nobody going anywhere.

1349
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,110
Get back to the shuffleboards.

1350
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:33,487
It's your shot, Pops.

1351
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:44,957
- Paisan Mageshin's.

1352
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,668
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Alda.

1353
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:50,045
Mr. De Salvo's in a conference.

1354
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,964
Shall I have him get back to you?

1355
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:53,340
Fine.

1356
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:56,135
- Vic, you want Monday
night, it's yours, babe.

1357
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:57,428
Run with it.

1358
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:00,431
- Okay, I'm going to save your asses.

1359
01:16:00,432 --> 01:16:03,892
I've got a story based on a
character that I grew up with.

1360
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,936
His name was Nunzio Romanelli.

1361
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,649
- That's good, I'm laughing already.

1362
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:12,317
- It's not a comedy.

1363
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,863
It's an action-adventure.

1364
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:17,448
- Action-adventure?

1365
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:20,659
Good counter programming, write
that down, action-adventure.

1366
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,162
- Anyway, Nunzio hung out

1367
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:26,665
in Coney Provo's bar on Route 4.

1368
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,126
If you wanted to get your rocks off,

1369
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,211
you went to see Nunzio.

1370
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:34,548
- You want to do a show about a pimp?

1371
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:35,675
- Yeah.

1372
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:37,926
- Breakthrough concept.

1373
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,262
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good,

1374
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,764
write it down, write it down.

1375
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,098
- Yeah.

01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:46,101
Number one,
number one, number one!

1377

Number one, number one, number one!

01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,106
Number one, number one!

1379
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,775

all been waiting for,

that begins with action,
adventure, and beautiful women.

1388

You'll want to spend the

1389

He's the doctor of love.

He's gonna make you

And then,

Hi, this is Francine.

1426
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,484
I can't come to the phone right now.

1427
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,320
If you leave a message at the
tone, I'll get back to you,

1428
01:19:43,321 --> 01:19:44,821
unless you're Vic De Salvo.

1429
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:47,699
- Oh, come on, Francine.

1430
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,577
You keep torturing me about this cruise.

1431
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,287
It's been a month.

1432
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,457
I'm a hit and I can't
enjoy it without you.

1433
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:09,096
Francine, I'm sick of talking to a beep.

1434
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:11,765
Come on, don't be angry at me.

1435
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:15,811
Those families are enjoying
themselves, honest.

1436
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:18,855
Guam is gorgeous this time of year.

1437
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:21,191
Come on, Francine, I know you're there.

1438
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:22,609
Come on, pick up the phone.

1439
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,319
Come on, why do you do this to me?

1440
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,906
Come on, Francine?

1441
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:31,368
Francine, pick it up, pick it
up, pick it up, pick it up,

1442
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:33,203
pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!

1443
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:44,923
- In our show-biz headlines
tonight, TV's Bonnie Franklin

1444
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:47,217
tells us how God changed her life,

1445
01:20:47,218 --> 01:20:50,804
Sally Struthers talks candidly
of her bout with chocolate,

1446
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,432
and the nominees for the TV Digest Awards

1447
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:56,476
were announced today,
but first, our top story.

1448
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,270
Denise?

1449
01:20:57,271 --> 01:21:00,355
- CBS dropped a bombshell
today by announcing it

1450
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:04,026
could no longer subscribe to
the Computron rating service.

1451
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:06,111
At a hastily called news conference,

1452
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:09,157
network spokesman Alvin
Small had this to say.

1453
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,327
- We challenge the accuracy
of their polling methods.

1454
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:16,496
How is it possible that Nunzio's Girls

1455
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,624
beat the M♪A♪S♪H reunion special?

1456
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:22,252
- This is a sorry day for Computron.

1457
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,964
Never once in 30 years has our credibility

1458
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,175
been challenged, until now.

1459
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:31,011
I want an internal investigation,

1460
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:34,097
I want a complete systems check,

1461
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,099
and I want it today.

1462
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,314
- Oh, no, we're in some hot water now.

1463
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:45,067
- Yeah, we better get
outta this town fast.

1464
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,152
- You dumb bastard, I oughta...

1465
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:49,946
- I didn't know the race was fixed, boss.

1466
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:53,743
- Uh oh, Goombas are in
trouble with their bookie.

1467
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,578
- It's not bad enough we
gotta watch TV at night,

1468
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,914
now we gotta watch it all damn day, too.

1469
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,958
- It's about time they put something

1470
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,920
on Saturday a person can relate to.

1471
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:24,564
You fishbait son-of-a...

1472
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,197
- Who the hell is that?

1473
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,741
- I don't know.

1474
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,911
- Well, go get rid of them.

1475
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:41,124
Hey, I ain't
fighting no friggin' lone star.

1476
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,090
- What do you want?

1477
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:51,716
- Mr. Sweeney?

1478
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,218
- Yeah.

1479
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:55,762
- Mr. Carl Sweeney?

1480
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:57,472
- Yeah, what's it to you?

1481
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,725
- Oh, I'm from the TV
rating service and I wanted

1482
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,562
to ask you some questions
about your viewing habits.

1483
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:05,439
- Yeah, well, I can't talk now,

1484
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,840
I've got some topovers in the oven.

1485
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:14,824
- Hey, hey, who cut the flounder in here?

1486
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:48,440
- Goody, I mean, who
would'a figured this, huh?

1487
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,816
This is incredible.

1488
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:54,030
Me, Vic De Salvo, up
for most popular actor.

1489
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:57,866
I just hope my public supports me.

1490
01:23:57,867 --> 01:24:01,286
- What public, you got 200
goons watching your show.

1491
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,205
Remember, it's the real
viewers that choose the winner,

1492
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,540
So you ain't got a chance.

1493
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:10,045
- Vic, I gotta talk to you.

1494
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:13,423
- Ah, Francine.

1495
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:16,635
- Listen to me, Vic, you
haven't got much time left.

1496
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,678
They're onto you, they're
conducting an investigation.

1497
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,597
- Oh, shit, I knew it.

1498
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,224
Vic, we gotta get the ship back.

1499
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,266
- How?

1500
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,727
We lost contact with them
when they passed the equator.

1501
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:28,688
- Well, we're getting lost
too, I'm making reservations.

1502
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,357
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, I'm not going

1503
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:33,276
anywhere until after that
award show tomorrow night.

1504
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:34,945
- Vic, are you crazy?

1505
01:24:34,946 --> 01:24:37,030
It could be a matter of
hours before this whole thing

1506
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,448
blows up in your face.

1507
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:40,325
Goody is right, you gotta leave town.

1508
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:41,826
- No, hold it.

1509
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,745
Look, you people don't understand.

1510
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,665
I came to Hollywood to make it big.

1511
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:47,707
- You did that.

1512
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,793
- But it's not official,

1513
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:52,295
not until tomorrow night,

1514
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,464
at that ceremony, when they read,

1515
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:56,675
"And the nominees are:

1516
01:24:56,676 --> 01:24:58,719
"Vic De Salvo."

1517
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,349
Francine,

1518
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,686
I want you there, by my side.

1519
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,147
That would make it perfect.

1520
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,487
- I've been miserable without you, Vic.

1521
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,948
- Me too.

1522
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,368
Does that mean you'll come with me?

1523
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,744
- Sure, what the hell?

1524
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,705
- Uncle Vic, it's ready.

1525
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:28,874
- Oh, thanks, Richie.

1526
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,336
- Goody, would you fix me a double scotch?

1527
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:34,964
- Yeah, I'll make it two.

1528
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:42,387
- Your attention, please.

1529
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:45,098
Mambo lessons on B-deck
have been postponed.

1530
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:48,018
Good news is that we have
picked up a day and a half

1531
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:50,186
due to the storm currents and we should be

1532
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:53,231
in the Aleutian Islands
in time for Christmas.

1533
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:56,234
Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way!

1534
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:06,786
- Oh, Mr. Vandergelder,
we don't exactly know

1535
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,872
what De Salvo has done with the families,

1536
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:12,877
but this scam is definitely
happening all over the country.

1537
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:21,009
And now,
back to live coverage

1538
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:23,470
of the 11th annual TV Digest Awards.

1539
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:25,388
- And here comes the recipient

1540
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:28,016
of tonight's lifetime achievement award,

1541
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:30,727
ladies and gentlemen, one of
America's greatest comedians,

1542
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:32,604
Mr. Benny Benson!

1543
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,107
Still chasing the girls!

1544
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:39,277
- You're on me, but I forgot
what to do when I catch 'em!

1545
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,323
- That's our Benny.

1546
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:47,036
- I'm taking a pretty big
chance, coming here tonight.

1547
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:51,373
- It was worth it to
see you in that dress.

1548
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:52,540
- Like it?

1549
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,792
- Yeah, I like it.

1550
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:55,585
- It's a bridal gown, my mother bought it

1551
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:56,921
for me as a birthday hint.

1552
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,019
- Hey, Bruno, don't get lost,

1553
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,397
because right after the show,
I'm leaving for the airport.

1554
01:27:15,398 --> 01:27:16,691
- All right, boss.

1555
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,361
Hey, uh, hey, boss, break a leg, huh?

1556
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,238
- Okay.

1557
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,966
- Officer, officer.

1558
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:44,969
- Oh, program.

1559
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:50,099
Vic, look, look!

1560
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,144
- It finally hit the fan.

1561
01:27:54,145 --> 01:27:55,687
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.

1562
01:27:55,688 --> 01:27:58,523
- Uh, look, you go to your seat.

1563
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,191
Don't worry about me.

1564
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,404
If I could just duck them
until I hear my name called.

1565
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:05,613
- Be careful.

1566
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:06,866
- Yeah.

1567
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:12,078
- Okay, go now, Benny.

1568
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:13,079
- Oh.

1569
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,372
- I don't want to have to take you

1570
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,773
during the show six times, come on.

1571
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:19,043
That's it, come on.

1572
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,130
Don't dawdle in there.

1573
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:33,057
- Well, he couldn't have
gotten out of this building,

1574
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,517
all the exits are blocked.

1575
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:36,896
- Well, we'll keep looking,
sir, he won't get away.

1576
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,231
- If this is true, Braithwaite,

1577
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,194
I'm going to feed your nuts to Buster.

1578
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,654
- Parker, Denise Leclair, Showbiz Tonight.

1579
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,115
- Oh, hi, Denise, hi.

1580
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:50,992
Should be a terrific show this evening.

1581
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,036
- Parker, they're already
calling it Ratingsgate,

1582
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:55,246
the first rigging of the
ratings by a major network.

1583
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,748
Any comment?

1584
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:02,587
Live from Los Angeles,

1585
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:06,133
the 11th Annual TV Digest Awards.

1586
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,887
Brought to you by ChemCorp:

1587
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,431
we're fighting to earn back your trust.

1588
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:15,725
And Bow Wow Chow:

1589
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:18,687
we only call it dog
food because we have to.

1590
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:28,905
- Come on, zip it up,
Benny, the show's starting.

1591
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,451
It's about time.

1592
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:34,703
Come on.

1593
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,331
That a boy.

1594
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,959
Let's not catch a chill,
you're doing Merv tomorrow.

1595
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,794
Okay, let's go.

1596
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:46,631
And now,
your host, Mr. Steve Allen!

1597
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,270
- Thank you very much,

1598
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:03,231
and welcome to long
day's journey into night.

1599
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:07,610
I guess I was the, uh, logical choice

1600
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:09,654
to host this show, I'm the
only one in the business

1601
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:11,406
who's not up for an award tonight.

1602
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,617
But all seriousness aside,

1603
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:17,829
it's a real pleasure for me

1604
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,873
to look out here at
this particular audience

1605
01:30:19,874 --> 01:30:21,291
and see all the new faces

1606
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:23,209
on top of the old faces.

1607
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:26,296
But I do want to welcome everybody

1608
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:28,548
to the TV Digest Awards.

1609
01:30:28,549 --> 01:30:30,008
And you know what makes
this show different

1610
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:31,927
from the other 712 award shows

1611
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:35,430
is that you, the viewer, pick the winners,

1612
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:39,017
that's right, using the ballots
in your TV Digest Magazine.

1613
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:41,728
And now, from the accounting
firm of Skank and Skank,

1614
01:30:41,729 --> 01:30:45,106
here's Mr. Zack Silverman
to explain the rules.

1615
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,573
- All right, you little son of a bitch,

1616
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,409
I know you're in there, come on out.

1617
01:30:58,704 --> 01:30:59,872
Holy shit.

1618
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:06,878
- This is a hell of a
life achievement award.

1619
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,506
- Well, here, now comes the moment

1620
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:13,134
that I personally have been
looking forward to, the annual

1621
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:17,347
presentation of TV Digest's
life achievement award,

1622
01:31:17,348 --> 01:31:19,933
given to those who have
distinguished themselves

1623
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:23,436
in a long career of television excellence,

1624
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:27,440
and who better to receive
this award than Benny Benson?

1625
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,818
That's right, if you grew up in the '50s,

1626
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:33,656
you knew Benny as Uncle
Moe on The Ginsburgs.

1627
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:36,449
If you grew up in the '60s,

1628
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:40,079
you knew him as Uncle
Ned on Give it to Gopher.

1629
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,247
And if you grew up in the '70s,

1630
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:46,918
you knew him as Gramps
on Them Darn McGintys.

1631
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:49,253
Well, sir, he's 87 years old now,

1632
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:51,631
and he still watches his
reruns from the actors' home

1633
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,883
in Woodlands Hills, ladies and gentlemen,

1634
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:56,260
Mr. Benny Benson, how about it?

1635
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:02,935
Doesn't he look great?

1636
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,940
Oh, thank you, my dear.

1637
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:11,859
Benny, here's your well-deserved
award, God love you.

1638
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,031
It's a TV award.

1639
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,201
How about this, Benny?

1640
01:32:24,415 --> 01:32:27,251
- He stole my big
moment, I'm Benny Benson!

1641
01:32:29,503 --> 01:32:30,920
Go shoot him.

1642
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:35,216
- What the...

1643
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:36,677
- Benny, Benny!

1644
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:41,889
- Ladies and gentlemen, how about this?

1645
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,349
It's unplanned and unbelievable.

1646
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,228
Benny Benson is doing one of
his great fall man sketches,

1647
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:48,896
A Night at the Station!

1648
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,657
Isn't that fantastic, folks?

1649
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:02,785
A classic bit of slapstick
from the golden age of comedy.

1650
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,538
- Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

1651
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,503
87 years old, the man
can still take a pratfall.

1652
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,260
- Okay, all right, we got him.

1653
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:20,595
- You have the right to remain silent.

1654
01:33:20,596 --> 01:33:22,180
You give up that right to remain silent,

1655
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:23,973
anything you say can and will be held

1656
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:25,266
against you in a court of law.

1657
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:28,269
- Vic, how could you do this to me?

1658
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,354
- And now to join me
in presenting the award

1659
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:33,024
for most popular actor, she's lovely,

1660
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:36,319
she's talented, and she also
wrote this introduction,

1661
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,820
Miss Jane Meadows, here she is.

1662
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:45,703
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart,
for that lovely introduction.

1663
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:49,457
The nominees for America's
most popular actor,

1664
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:52,251
as voted by the readers of TV Digest, are:

1665
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:53,920
Alan Alda...

1666
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:57,173
- You have violated the sanctity

1667
01:33:57,174 --> 01:33:59,175
of the ratings system.

1668
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:01,511
- Quiet, they're about to read my name.

1669
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:02,637
Tom Selleck.

1670
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:05,307
- You'll hear your name at
the arraignment, let's go.

1671
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:08,352
Hey, you!

1672
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:14,315
John Forsythe.

1673
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:19,321
- Fan out, let's fan out!

1674
01:34:22,658 --> 01:34:24,283
Robert Wagner.

1675
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,582
And Vic De Salvo.

1676
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,677
- May we have the envelope
please, thank you.

1677
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:46,222
- And the winner is, oh, so exciting.

1678
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:47,683
- John Forsythe.

1679
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,478
- Vic De Salvo.

1680
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:58,734
- I won, I won?

1681
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:01,028
I won, I won!

1682
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,575
I won, I won, I can't believe it.

1683
01:35:05,576 --> 01:35:07,869
People must have been watching my show!

1684
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:10,580
- Uncle Vic, way to go, Uncle Vic!

1685
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:12,541
- Holy shit.

1686
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,129
- Hey, Francine.

1687
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,929
Thank you very much.

1688
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,182
Thank you, I, uh,

1689
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:32,185
I didn't think was gonna win,

1690
01:35:32,186 --> 01:35:35,980
so, I didn't prepare a speech.

1691
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:41,028
But I'll wing something.

1692
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:45,072
Uh, tomorrow, you's'a gonna be reading

1693
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:48,285
some very adverse publicity about me.

1694
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:53,373
These ain't exactly ID bracelets here.

1695
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,918
These are cuffs.

1696
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:59,922
I'd be lying if I said I
was sorry for what I did.

1697
01:36:02,216 --> 01:36:05,468
I've always wanted to be
part of this community,

1698
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:09,430
and I feel vindicated

1699
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:12,433
by this award, because...

1700
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:13,768
- Salute, Vic.

1701
01:36:13,769 --> 01:36:17,104
- It tells me that there
were people watching my show,

1702
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:20,483
and they like the show, it's
not just a handful of people

1703
01:36:20,484 --> 01:36:22,818
that were picked by a computer.

1704
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:26,072
So, I just want to say that, uh,

1705
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:28,784
this is the happiest night of my life.

1706
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,410
Thank you, thank you.

1707
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,707
Oh, and one more thing.

1708
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,921
There is a woman in the audience

1709
01:36:42,089 --> 01:36:44,298
who I'm probably not going to get

1710
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:46,802
to see much of for a little while.

1711
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:51,639
But I just want to tell her,

1712
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,517
in front of millions of people

1713
01:36:54,518 --> 01:36:56,311
all over the country,

1714
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,899
that I love her very much.

1715
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,612
Thank you.

1716
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,864
- Congratulations, we're
just going to walk over here.

1717
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:11,075
- I think there's some people
waiting for me over here.

1718
01:37:19,418 --> 01:37:22,128
And so Vic
De Salvo was convicted

1719
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:25,507
of tampering with television's
sacred rating system.

1720
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:29,802
And from his new base of operations,

1721
01:37:29,803 --> 01:37:34,099
De Salvo turned MBC into
the number one network,

1722
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:38,770
the programming genius of the age.

1723
01:37:42,024 --> 01:37:44,401
Mazel Tov!

1724
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:48,612
And his
wedding to Francine Kester

1725
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:51,198
became the social event of the season.

1726
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:04,962
But in the excitement, one
question remained unanswered:

1727
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:07,673
whatever became of those families?

1728
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:10,551
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells

1729

- Ho, ho, ho!

1734

Captain Santa here, now
hear this, present time!

1735
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:30,196
Yes, there you are.
