1
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,185
No one in need
who has ever approached you...

2
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:11,725
...the generous citizens
of Lake Forest, Illinois...

3
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,858
...has ever been refused.

4
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:16,649
Therefore, although
the United States...

5
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:19,360
...has not yet entered
the war in Europe...

6
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,609
...we of the American
Ambulance Service...

7
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:25,119
...have continued to donate men,
women and equipment...

8
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:30,034
...to aid our unfortunate wounded
French and British friends.

9
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,919
I want to thank this year's graduating
class of Lake Forest College...

10
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,044
...for this badly needed vehicle.
Hear, hear!

11
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:41,005
But more important,
I want to thank...

12
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,966
...the two brave members
of that class...

13
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,182
...who have volunteered to accompany
the ambulance overseas as drivers.

14
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:52,355
- Mr. Gray Maturin.
- Hey!

15
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,979
- That's my boy! That's my boy!
- Thanks, Pop.

16
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,143
And Mr. Larry Darrell.

17
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:02,151
Now, in order to raise funds
for this noble cause...

18
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,776
...Mr. Maturin is going to give
demonstration rides...

19
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,946
...around the village green...

20
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,206
...for the small donation
of 5 cents a person.

21
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:16,167
- The line forms to the right.
- You're first, ladies. Go on.

22
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:19,671
I do wish Mr. Darrell
had made his appearance.

23
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:24,005
I assure you, madam,
whatever Mr. Darrell is doing...

24
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:27,630
...he is servicing the needs
of your fine organisation.

25
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,683
I'm gonna take this whiskey,
okay? Got it?

26
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:41,151
Aren't you the cutest little
hat rack I've ever seen?

27
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,781
And don't scratch that pretty face.

28
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,221
Come on, let's go.

29
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,142
Kisses, 1 dollar?

30
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,302
I sure will, ma'am. Here you are.

31
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,680
One dollar.

32
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,059
It's amazing, isn't it?

33
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,060
I seem to have left my money
in my other uniform.

34
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,699
- You mean your Boy Scout uniform?
- Well, I just take what I want.

35
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,738
No! No!

36
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,585
Oh, you're getting heavy.

37
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:45,714
That hurt.

38
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,878
It's nice working for free.

39
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,381
Come on.

40
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:57,677
- Hey, Gray, can I get a ride?
- Jump in. All aboard.

41
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:00,723
Larry, I'm supposed to be
doing my patriotic duty.

42
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,055
Come on, your patriotic duty
my last night in town...

43
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,190
...is to leave me unable to walk.

44
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,851
- Come on. Seriously.
- Oh, no, no.

45
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,603
First the wedding,
then the honeymoon. Yeah.

46
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:13,699
Do it the other way around,
you end up like Bob and Sophie...

47
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:16,406
...stuck in that dumb old apartment.
I like that place.

48
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,821
How do you think they'll like it
when the baby comes?

49
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:21,405
- I don't know.
- No charge to boys in uniform.

50
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,368
Oh, well done. Very good.

51
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,212
Our baby's gonna have
its own room and a nanny...

52
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:31,708
Why don't you talk
to Gray about getting married.

53
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:34,554
He's got a million bucks.
He'll go for that nanny stuff.

54
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:37,841
Hey, look, I don't want a million bucks.
I just want you...

55
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:39,558
...and half a million bucks.

56
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:43,391
This is the singly
most disgusting concoction...

57
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:46,599
...in the culinary annals.

58
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,314
Well, that didn't stop you
eating a dozen of them...

59
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,937
...every Fourth of July
when you were a boy, Elliot.

60
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:55,652
This quaint little village may be
the place of my birth...

61
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,901
...but after 15 years in Paris...

62
00:05:58,077 --> 00:06:02,157
...I've come to regard that as a most
unfortunate accident of genetics.

63
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,910
Oh, Elliot, you are the biggest snob
in the world.

64
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:08,959
I sincerely hope so.

65
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:12,081
Nice-looking dog you got there, Unc.

66
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:15,377
Oh, how I envy you, young man.
Off to Paris, the City of Light.

67
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:16,833
Oh, my God.

68
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,254
I really ought to provide you
with a few introductions.

69
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,432
I could put you in touch with some
of the most elite members...

70
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,593
...of the European aristocracy
while you're there.

71
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,011
- Sophie, Bob, where you guys been?
- Hi.

72
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,062
Oh, Bob had to work.

73
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,517
- On a holiday? Gee, what a shame.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:34,896
Yeah, I almost missed seeing you
and Gray off. They kept me late.

75
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:38,522
Well, you're late, but you're
not too late to come with us!

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,573
- Bobby boy! Bobby boy!
- Hey!

77
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,985
Put him down! He's a dad!
He's not going anywhere!

78
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:46,578
- Can Bob play on the ambulance, then?
- No!

79
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,665
I don't have any life insurance!

80
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,539
Soph, what?

81
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,585
Here.

82
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,376
I had these printed up for you.

83
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,042
Your poems.

84
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,760
This is great.

85
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:47,922
Now I'll have something to read
to the guys in the trenches at night.

86
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,010
You used to like them.

87
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,561
Well, they're good.

88
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:56,353
I always liked the poet.

89
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,277
I'm gonna miss you.

90
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,783
You know, when we were kids...

91
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:14,288
...I was always terrified you were
the guy I was gonna have to marry.

92
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:22,589
But you just couldn't control yourself,
could you?

93
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,883
"Oh, Bob. Oh, Bob. Bob, don't.

94
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,718
Oh, Bob, don't!

95
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:32,802
Stop. Whatever you do, Bob, don't!

96
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,892
Oh, Bob."

97
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:44,391
Larry, Sophie, come on,
the fireworks are gonna start!

98
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,867
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

99
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,577
Thanks.

100
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,700
Thanks, Gray.

101
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,914
Hey, Bobby. Thank you.

102
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:11,049
Oh, God! More!

103
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,301
They're beautiful!

104
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:18,968
- Hey!
- Isn't that beautiful?

105
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:15,355
Hi.

106
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,073
This ambulance field headquarters?

107
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:26,157
Chicago. I know people in Chicago.

108
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:30,212
Jeez, you must be
the guys from Chicago.

109
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,215
Piedmont.

110
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,218
Fresh meat.

111
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,517
Fit them out, Malcolm.

112
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,688
I'm Piedmont.

113
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,059
I'm your leader.

114
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,769
That's Malcolm.
He's what's left of my followers.

115
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,065
We put three heaps to a squad.

116
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,574
There'll be you,
some dogmeat from Harvard...

117
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,244
...and our rig when it gets ready.

118
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,249
What the hell's the gun for?
America's not in the war.

119
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,302
Well, yes and no.

120
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,600
We don't get to kill anybody,
but they can kill us.

121
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,303
There's a big push on
tomorrow at Mons.

122
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,262
We leave the minute
this Harvard heap arrives.

123
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,667
Mr. Piedmont, I presume?

124
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:07,255
Doug Van Allen and Brian Ryan,
Harvard, '17.

125
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:10,599
- You must be Chicago.
- Lake Forest, actually.

126
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:12,257
- Larry Darrell.
- Doug Van Allen.

127
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,729
- Brian Ryan.
- Gray Maturin.

128
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:16,100
- How do you do?
- Larry Darrell.

129
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:20,017
- No trouble clearing this off the train?
- None, sir.

130
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:22,484
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Swellegant.

131
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,233
Hi, meat.

132
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,529
That paint job's
gonna make a great target.

133
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:29,695
Not the way we drive.

134
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:33,038
Doug and I did the six-mile course
at Harvard in six and a half.

135
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,034
Is that right?

136
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,662
Six and a half.

137
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:44,210
Piedmont and I did it at Yale
in six flat.

138
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:58,261
Okay, for now, I'll ride with Darrell.
Malcolm, you take Gray meat.

139
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,682
You two follow in Moby Dick.
Let's move!

140
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,268
- What is this foul stuff?
- Well, this definitely isn't chicken.

141
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,811
Oh, it's chicken.
Head, skin and feet.

142
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,688
Hey, Chicago, why don't you
finish this potted shrimp.

143
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,438
You betcha.

144
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:51,984
Thanks.

145
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:57,034
- Shrimp?
- Yes.

146
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,248
Shrimp?

147
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,691
God, what a car.

148
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,273
Thanks, Piedmont.

149
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:38,698
- Goddamn it! Are you crazy?
- You can't have headlights.

150
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:42,496
The heinies catch a flash of those
headlights, you guys are dead meat.

151
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:45,583
- Goddamn it, you're drunk!
- Drunk?

152
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:50,212
The liquor never even makes it
to my brain, Dougie boy.

153
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,174
You're educated men.
Let's get this over with.

154
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:58,388
You came over here for a little fun,
a little excitement...

155
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,011
...and to help your fellow man.

156
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,891
Well, you won't help anybody.

157
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:09,763
And you know why? Because you
can't even help yourselves.

158
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,351
And after the first good
mortar concussion...

159
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,528
...you'll be picking that windshield
right out of your face...

160
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,947
...so you might as well
get rid of it right now.

161
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:23,277
- Piedmont, what are you doing?
- I am helping my fellow man.

162
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,198
Gray, Darrell, come here!

163
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,693
The hospital is eight kilometres.

164
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,575
Don't stop for anything.
No matter what happens, don't stop!

165
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:54,500
Piedmont, there has got to be
something else.

166
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,919
- You got a driver's licence?
- Licence?

167
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,093
Don't stop, Larry.

168
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:18,518
- What's he saying?
- Didn't they teach French in college?

169
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:21,526
I was a baseball major.
What does he want?

170
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,069
What does he want?

171
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,858
He says his arm is shattered,
and it's pinned under the body...

172
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:28,985
...of another guy who won't move,
because he's already dead.

173
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,487
He's sure he's dying...

174
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,827
...and if you had the decency of half
a human being, you'd do something!

175
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,954
I don't know what he wants!

176
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,248
Don't stop, Larry!

177
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:54,596
All right, boys, everybody sing
or we aim for the ruts!

178
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,369
Oh, my God, I've been hit!

179
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,292
- What are you doing?
- Doug's been hit!

180
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:24,496
Hey, Doug Van Allen's
been hit. In his wrist.

181
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,628
Well, Piedmont says not to stop.

182
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,668
Darrell, Doug and I crewed together!

183
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,049
Doug Van Allen and Brian Ryan,
wasn't it?

184
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,924
Jeez, what a couple of liars, huh?

185
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:20,552
They loved to lie, those two.

186
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,848
They enjoyed it.

187
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,018
They never did any goddamn
six miles in six and a half.

188
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:33,352
Maybe you don't, but I hate liars.

189
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:39,155
I hated those two
when they told their little lies.

190
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,074
They won't be missed.

191
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,442
Green River at the sweetshop.

192
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,731
The first thing I'm gonna have
when we get home.

193
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:13,113
Could be any day now too...

194
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:16,165
...now that Uncle Sam's in the war.

195
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,341
You okay?

196
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:37,186
It's getting light.

197
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:49,694
Come on!

198
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:00,208
- How are you?
- I'm bad.

199
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,920
We need help.

200
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:10,508
- What now?
- Now we wait.

201
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,519
Hey, Piedmont.

202
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,536
- What was that?
- Grenade.

203
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,208
- Horseshit.
- Okay, it was some woman's tee shot.

204
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,152
Darrell, look out!

205
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,055
Nice going, Piedmont.

206
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:53,311
He was a slob.

207
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:58,946
Did you ever see him eat?

208
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:05,704
Starving children could
fill their bellies...

209
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:09,326
...on the food that ended up
on his beard and clothes.

210
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,832
Dogs would gather...

211
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,542
...to watch him eat.

212
00:24:20,972 --> 00:24:23,344
I never understood gluttony.

213
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:27,052
But I hate it.

214
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,848
I hated that about you.

215
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:40,489
He enjoyed disgusting people...

216
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:44,358
...being disgusting,
the thrill of offending people...

217
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:46,659
...and making them uncomfortable.

218
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,372
He was despicable.

219
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:00,962
He will not be missed.

220
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,652
I'm very sorry. It was my fault.

221
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,900
It was my fault, really.
Now, let's try again.

222
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,084
More champagne! Fine.

223
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,512
Look out, here comes Frankie.

224
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:52,762
- What a generation.
- No, no, let them burn off some steam.

225
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,142
The war heroes have earned it.

226
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:59,647
But come next week, I'll work the two
of those boys ragged at the office.

227
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:03,945
Next week?
It's the first I've heard of it.

228
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:07,648
Larry's been so quiet about things
since he got back.

229
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,781
Hi. I think we need to talk.

230
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,962
Larry, this has been going on
for three weeks.

231
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:29,918
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be in training?

232
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:32,718
Did it ever occur to you
that you might be avoiding me?

233
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:38,103
- Okay, let's talk.
- No, Larry, you come out.

234
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,597
Larry! Damn it!

235
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,684
Okay, let's talk.

236
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,484
Seal talk.

237
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:03,121
Okay, let's talk.

238
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,798
Thank you.

239
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:15,387
We all believe in you, Larry.

240
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:19,637
I mean, Mother and myself
and Mr. Maturin.

241
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:22,563
And we all know that you've
had some kind of a...

242
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:25,482
...well, shock over there,
and that...

243
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:29,484
Well, that you just needed time
to kind of "loaf around"...

244
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:31,397
...as you put it.

245
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:32,983
But...

246
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:39,204
...doesn't it seem that it's time to...?
To get back on your feet again?

247
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,323
Yeah.

248
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,831
No.

249
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:48,838
What?

250
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:51,254
I wanna put off the wedding
for a while.

251
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,923
I wanna put off the job too.

252
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:57,804
For a while anyway.

253
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,466
I don't understand.

254
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:06,188
In your letter,
all you talked about was...

255
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:11,725
...coming back and getting married
and starting the job.

256
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:16,353
I lied.

257
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,406
I didn't know I was lying...

258
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,071
...but I guess I was.

259
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,868
I see.

260
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:36,165
I don't think I'm the guy
you wanna marry right now.

261
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:39,178
This isn't the old Mr. Sunshine.

262
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,382
I'm not happy.

263
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:45,891
I can't make myself happy.
I couldn't make you happy.

264
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,270
I just wanna think.

265
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,347
I need to think...

266
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:55,312
...and I don't have much
experience in that field.

267
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:56,897
Think?

268
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:00,240
Think about what?

269
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,490
I don't know.

270
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:06,864
Me, you, our lives.

271
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:10,247
I'll tell you when I start thinking.

272
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:16,839
So you want me and everyone else
to just go on and on...

273
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:21,135
...sitting here, waiting for you
to figure out the meaning of life?

274
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,471
- Well, sort of, yeah.
- Well, that's just great.

275
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,394
- Okay, well, we'll... We'll see.
- Yeah, you wait. You wait.

276
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,183
My money is in...
Your money's in my pocket.

277
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,596
Bob?

278
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,230
As long as he's on their team,
we're bound to win.

279
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,433
Right.

280
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,809
Bob?

281
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:44,569
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we should leave
now if you're gonna make it for work.

282
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,945
Come on, hon. One more scrum.
We're three goals behind.

283
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,205
You can't take him from us now.
I've got a bet on with Gray.

284
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,705
Oh, yes I can, Tyler.

285
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,002
What are you making
at that sweatbox anyway?

286
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,127
I'll buy them out for the night.

287
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,461
Thanks anyway, Tyler, but I think
you can manage without him.

288
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,221
All right.

289
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,346
We'll just have to play
five on six, then.

290
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,143
- See you, Gray.
- See you, Bobby.

291
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:34,953
- Is everything all right, dear?
- Mom, there's been a change of plans.

292
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,876
We're going to postpone
the wedding, just for a while.

293
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:40,785
- You're what?
- Now, don't start one of your things.

294
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,790
It's just for a while.

295
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:46,381
He wants to be by himself right now,
so he's going to Paris.

296
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:49,422
Paris.

297
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:52,882
I think he needs a little time by
himself. I'm gonna give him that.

298
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:57,720
Oh, Isabel, don't be so naive.
It's just an excuse.

299
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:59,853
It is not an excuse!

300
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:04,523
He loves me.

301
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:08,317
You know, if I may say so, Louisa...

302
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,063
...it makes perfect sense to me.

303
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,528
All Americans should avail
themselves...

304
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,613
...of at least one season in Paris...

305
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:19,411
...just prior to marriage.

306
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:22,750
It curbs the itches
which tend to rise...

307
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,126
...a year or two
down the connubial pike.

308
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,008
Elliot, don't be vulgar.

309
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,343
People think I'm being vulgar
when I'm being serious...

310
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:35,264
...and they think I'm being serious
when I'm being vulgar.

311
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:39,969
- Then you'll take care of him for me?
- Of course I will.

312
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,303
I'll arrange his passage for him.

313
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:44,557
You know, the people
you meet on the ship...

314
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,725
...often set the tone
for the entire tour.

315
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:49,190
I think the Mauretania for Larry.

316
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:51,734
Yes. Yes, the Mauretania.

317
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:57,036
He'll sit at the captain's table...

318
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,279
...and meet all the right people.

319
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,167
Then he'll need a first-class hotel
where he can entertain.

320
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:07,953
I think a suite at the Georges V
would be perfect.

321
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,458
Roland!

322
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:25,727
Don't worry, we'll have your boyfriend
back to you in no time.

323
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,003
Well, hello. Welcome to Paris.

324
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,335
- Louisa, my dear, at last.
- Elliot.

325
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,391
- It's so good to see you.
- And here she is.

326
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,516
Hi, Uncle Elliot.

327
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:07,930
Welcome to my humble abode.
Come in, my dear.

328
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:09,765
- Oh, thank you.
- How was your crossing?

329
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,558
- I read it was a little inclement.
- Well, it wasn't too good.

330
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,644
Come along, Cinderella.

331
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:21,701
Oh, Elliot.

332
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,742
This is a palace.

333
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:26,319
Why, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

334
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:28,455
Oh, my God.

335
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,993
This is my music room.

336
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,005
Oh, isn't that lovely?

337
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:37,628
Oh, what a beautiful piano.

338
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,793
Well, it's a spinet by Larande...

339
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:42,424
...late-18 th-century French.

340
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:46,466
- It must have cost a fortune.
- It did.

341
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:49,762
My poor dear friend the viscount
de Corvence had to part with it...

342
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:51,645
...at a slight reduction...

343
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:55,478
...but then, estates are so draining
on one these days, don't you find?

344
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:57,643
And are all these things for sale?

345
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,895
My dear Louisa, this isn't a shop.

346
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:06,611
I occasionally allow the odd piece
to be torn from my grasp.

347
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:12,415
You've got that
lovely picture of Mother.

348
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:27,513
This room...

349
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:30,433
I never dreamed anyone
could ever live like this.

350
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,174
Why, it's not difficult
if you know what you want.

351
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:40,478
This outfit looks really
ridiculous, doesn't it?

352
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,319
Especially over here.

353
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:45,353
- I'm such a mess.
- The dress is.

354
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:47,441
We'll get you a new one.

355
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,526
You, yourself, are exquisite.

356
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,116
You belong in a room like this.

357
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,494
It and everything in it
will be yours someday.

358
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:04,334
I had hoped that you might
grow up in this house.

359
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:06,501
You're the only family I have.

360
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:10,295
But your mother preferred to remain
in the cow pastures of Illinois.

361
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:16,974
No worry, I realise why you finally
deigned to visit your old uncle.

362
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:22,683
Larry's stayed here longer
than you expected, hasn't he?

363
00:35:23,777 --> 00:35:25,651
I assure you I did
everything I promised you.

364
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:28,857
I invited him to parties, he claimed
he didn't have a dinner jacket.

365
00:35:29,032 --> 00:35:32,152
I asked him to lunch,
he said he didn't eat lunch.

366
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,742
Elliot Templeton gets the message.

367
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:58,725
Nice catch.

368
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,017
Be careful, my dear.

369
00:36:05,192 --> 00:36:06,769
That one plate is worth more...

370
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:09,814
...than your young man has earned
in a whole year.

371
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,762
Hello, Mr. Templeton.

372
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,722
- Hello, Mrs. Bradley.
- Hello, Larry.

373
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:47,478
I'm sorry that I'm late,
but I had to pick up the band.

374
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:50,223
I hope you'll forgive me.

375
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,700
In case you get the chill.

376
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:09,411
We cross the fingers.

377
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:17,728
- Who are they?
- They're from Les Halles.

378
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:20,311
I work with them in the stalls.

379
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:21,900
Work?

380
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,696
I thought you came over here
to think.

381
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:28,620
Well, I did. But I learned too much.

382
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,698
I'd read so many books,
you could smell wood burning.

383
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,579
So I took a job packing fish.

384
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:37,129
Packing fish?

385
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:39,375
Yeah, it's a good job.

386
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:40,580
I like it.

387
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:42,843
Well, that's great.

388
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:45,050
I mean, that you like it.

389
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,301
Is that what you're gonna tell
Mr. Maturin when you see him?

390
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:53,473
That you kept him waiting six months
because you like to pack fish?

391
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,275
I'm not going back.

392
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:11,492
I'm not going to be a stockbroker.

393
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:19,625
Marry me. We can raise a family.

394
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:21,788
We can travel.

395
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:24,835
I have $3000 . That is more
than most people live on.

396
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,301
Larry...

397
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:29,548
...we are not most people.

398
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:33,138
- We're special people.
- Iz, nobody is special.

399
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,933
I'm special.

400
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:37,640
I am not gonna spend my whole life
tagging along behind you...

401
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:39,224
...making both ends meet.

402
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:41,641
- Come on.
- No, Larry. Come on.

403
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:43,691
It's not fair.

404
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:49,229
I've lived up to my half of the bargain.
You haven't lived up to yours.

405
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:55,068
I should just give this back to you.

406
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:06,213
Don't give it back.

407
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,216
Wear it on another finger.

408
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:12,596
It will mean...

409
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:15,255
...that there is one man somewhere...

410
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:16,975
...who will always love you.

411
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,222
- What does that mean?
- Look, I got a second chance at life.

412
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:25,477
I am not gonna waste it on a big house,
a new car every year...

413
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:28,936
...and a bunch of friends who want
a big house and a new car every year!

414
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:36,111
I can't turn back now.
I want you to come with me.

415
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:52,188
Would you like
a chilled glass of Chablis?

416
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:53,854
Yeah.

417
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:05,239
So, what do you do
when it's hot outside?

418
00:42:05,414 --> 00:42:06,694
Drink red.

419
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:20,008
Did you read all these books?

420
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:25,389
I skimmed them.

421
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:32,642
To think I used to help you
with your homework.

422
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,568
Yeah, you got me
through grade school.

423
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:41,447
It wasn't that hard, really, you know.

424
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:43,193
All you had to do was...

425
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:46,276
Was what they told you to do.

426
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,744
Well, I'm doing my own thinking now.

427
00:44:32,847 --> 00:44:36,347
- I want to speak with Isabel.
- But she's not here, Monsieur Larry.

428
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:40,265
You're not doing butler stuff
on me, are you?

429
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:42,976
Isabel?

430
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:47,939
Isabel?

431
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:55,279
Isabel?!

432
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:59,407
Joseph.

433
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:05,577
Isabel has gone. She and her mother
have taken the boat train.

434
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,135
Joseph, I appear to have been
crashing about again...

435
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:20,514
...without my spectacles.

436
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,561
I'm really very, very sorry.

437
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,086
Bob, hurry up, they're coming.

438
00:45:58,346 --> 00:45:59,544
Here, they're coming now.

439
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:08,720
Thank you.

440
00:46:13,027 --> 00:46:15,103
Goodbye. Thank you.

441
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:22,948
- You're a lucky man.
- Thank you.

442
00:46:26,874 --> 00:46:28,285
Sally.

443
00:46:55,485 --> 00:46:57,561
Be back in the office by Monday.

444
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:01,527
Let's have a drink.
Hello, Mary, Shirley.

445
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,822
I wonder if we'll ever see him again.

446
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:07,656
He'll come back, but he'll
be a little late, won't he?

447
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:13,365
I wonder if she'll still let Gray
give him that job.

448
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,995
Oh, God, Bob,
Larry doesn't want that job.

449
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:49,701
That's refreshing.

450
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,487
Who do you think you're saving?

451
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,674
- Have a drink with me.
- What for?

452
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,809
I owe you my life.

453
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,055
My life's worth one drink.

454
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,298
How about some cards?

455
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,795
Well, I've watched you play.
I think you must cheat.

456
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,308
I've watched you read.

457
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,267
You read funny books
for a coal miner.

458
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,858
Oh, yes, that. There's a god of light
and a god of darkness.

459
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,695
Heaven for good people and hell
for bad ones. You believe that?

460
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,903
I believe...

461
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,201
...that you're saving nines.

462
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:07,664
What else do you read?

463
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:12,002
The Apocalypse, Essenes,
Aristotle, Plato?

464
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:15,006
What about Znachar,
the Russian sorcerer?

465
00:50:17,304 --> 00:50:19,343
The Upanishads?

466
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:24,180
You've never read the Upanishads?

467
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:28,097
You don't know so much.

468
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:32,350
You really don't know anything,
do you?

469
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:36,402
Lend me your copy.

470
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:41,198
I never lend books to coal miners.
They've got dirty hands.

471
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:56,205
- Have you been to India?
- What's in India?

472
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:00,922
Hundreds of millions of people
that pray three times a day.

473
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:05,679
There are answers there.

474
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:08,598
India's a lonely place.

475
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:10,437
If I'd stayed...

476
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:16,521
...I never would have known
this little one.

477
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,490
Very good.

478
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:33,785
I'm a good cheater.

479
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:55,141
Here. The Upanishads.

480
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:58,067
But you won't find
the answers in a book.

481
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:00,274
You'll have to go there.

482
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:15,448
What about her husband
and her son?

483
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:20,628
They were killed instantly.
A drunken driver. Head-on.

484
00:52:36,688 --> 00:52:38,230
Oh, Sophie.

485
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:42,943
Izzy.

486
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:48,442
Baby.

487
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:54,411
My baby's gone.

488
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,825
Bob, he's gone.

489
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,873
Oh, my God!

490
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,461
At least...

491
00:53:08,677 --> 00:53:10,551
...they didn't suffer.

492
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,880
Get out of here.

493
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:17,182
- Izzy, get her out of here!
- Please, please.

494
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:20,270
This is a sad time, Mrs. MacDonald...

495
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,354
...but it is also a day for rejoicing.

496
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:26,481
Our Lord has promised to call us
all home to him in heaven.

497
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,108
And today he has called home
your husband and child.

498
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:35,739
You're like idiots.

499
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:40,447
They're dead, you freak!

500
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:43,166
They're dead!

501
00:53:44,837 --> 00:53:48,704
Dead! Get away from me
with that thing!

502
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,295
Are you gonna be here in a week
when I wake up?

503
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:56,716
In a month? In a year?
For the rest of my life?

504
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,176
Mrs. MacDonald,
I know you're upset.

505
00:54:01,353 --> 00:54:03,310
What do you know?

506
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:06,975
I had that baby inside of me!

507
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,270
I had that man inside of me!

508
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:14,571
You, you've never had
anyone inside of you!

509
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:16,486
- Oh, lzzy! No!
- Please!

510
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:20,621
- All right. You'll have to leave.
- No!

511
00:54:20,788 --> 00:54:23,659
- Izzy, don't leave me! Don't go!
- Please.

512
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,917
- Izzy, don't leave me, please!
- Sister.

513
00:54:27,086 --> 00:54:29,838
- Sister, hold her.
- No! What happens now?

514
00:54:30,006 --> 00:54:31,713
No, lzzy, don't go!

515
00:54:32,258 --> 00:54:34,001
All right. All right, it's all right.

516
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,755
Izzy!

517
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:55,583
You need guide, sahib?

518
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:59,088
No, my friend. Thank you. Here.

519
00:55:59,258 --> 00:56:02,923
- More rupees. More rupees.
- How are you?

520
00:56:03,262 --> 00:56:04,637
More rupees.

521
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:07,429
Is this your sister?

522
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,679
Here.

523
00:56:09,184 --> 00:56:11,936
Here's 2 rupees.
Give one to your sister now.

524
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:20,486
Okay. All right, there's 5.
Split them up, okay?

525
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,587
Help me out here, pal!

526
00:56:48,848 --> 00:56:51,173
Come here! Come in here!

527
00:56:52,518 --> 00:56:55,091
Okay, thank you.
I like it. I like it. I'll take it.

528
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:25,378
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

529
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,844
You must find it pleasant to be rich.

530
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,887
I'm not rich.

531
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,474
I'm often mistaken.

532
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,647
I worked in a coal mine
to come over here.

533
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:44,097
A coal mine?

534
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:47,443
What was the intention?

535
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:50,697
- To make money to come over here.
- That was the reason.

536
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:53,024
What was the intention?

537
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:57,402
Because if work has no intention,
it's not work at all.

538
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,825
It's an empty motion.

539
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,996
Well, what would you call
washing dishes?

540
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:05,375
For me, this is
a religious experience.

541
00:58:07,465 --> 00:58:09,374
Hey, let me try that.

542
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:21,594
Yeah, I feel it.
Kind of like being in church.

543
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:24,561
Pass me the soap, will you, bishop?

544
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:36,990
I could take you to a better church.

545
00:58:38,912 --> 00:58:40,904
In the mountains.

546
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:43,870
I've been there
many times before to work.

547
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,126
It's a difficult place to reach.

548
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:52,252
- It's a difficult place to work.
- Who washes the dishes up there?

549
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:01,759
- Could you leave at dawn?
- Want me to talk to your boss?

550
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:07,597
Boss? I have no boss.
I own this boat.

551
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,559
And a few more.

552
01:00:58,505 --> 01:00:59,833
Ta-da!

553
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,090
- Too much?
- Very good.

554
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,719
Smashing, in fact.

555
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:08,175
What do you think, honey?
Too much? Not enough?

556
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:13,218
Is this gonna help?
Is this gonna get me anything?

557
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:15,433
What do you think?

558
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:16,980
No?

559
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:20,730
Well, gee, I know
what this one here is...

560
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:23,226
...but shouldn't this one
be walking by now?

561
01:01:23,404 --> 01:01:26,819
I mean, did you ever think of giving it
a cold shower or an aspirin?

562
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:36,538
I could do pretty well
up here, I think.

563
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:41,162
They see few Westerners up here.

564
01:01:41,713 --> 01:01:43,540
They see none
where we are heading.

565
01:01:49,387 --> 01:01:51,380
Our guides.

566
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,473
That's the church, Larry.

567
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:13,271
Now, let's hurry.
Must get back to my boats.

568
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:28,169
I have been waiting for you. Welcome.

569
01:05:28,348 --> 01:05:30,257
You are welcome.

570
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:35,764
Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

571
01:05:58,544 --> 01:05:59,954
Excuse me.

572
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:02,955
Are you having a good time?

573
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:09,010
Well, I thought I told you two
it was time for bed.

574
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:11,504
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Maturin.
- It's all right, Barbara.

575
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,638
I'll take them up.
Come on, angel face.

576
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:16,477
I hear you bond boys are losing
a lot of your clients' money.

577
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:20,143
Yeah. What does your old man
think of that, Gray?

578
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:23,603
Well, think what you like
about my old man, Tyler.

579
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:26,694
Believe me, I know
how difficult he is to live with.

580
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:29,863
But the fact is, he's a good man.
A damn good man.

581
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:31,230
Excuse me, sir. Telephone.

582
01:06:31,408 --> 01:06:33,366
- They have their baths?
- They did. Yes.

583
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,160
We'll tell a nice story.

584
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,703
How are you?

585
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,080
Hello. Yes.

586
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:49,004
I'm telling you, there's 12 percent
unemployment out there.

587
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:50,456
And we're really feeling it.

588
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:53,672
I think Roosevelt's right.
We got a depression on our hands.

589
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:04,768
Gray!

590
01:07:12,948 --> 01:07:14,740
Did you see that?

591
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:41,179
It was a nice service for your dad.

592
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,261
- Yeah, short and sweet.
- Yeah?

593
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:48,811
Hey, nice tic you got there, Gray.

594
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,474
Here. Have a shot.

595
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:54,439
It'll go faster for a minute,
and then it'll stop.

596
01:07:54,614 --> 01:07:56,986
- No, thanks.
- No?

597
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:05,244
Hey, look at that freak. Why didn't he
jump in the grave with your dad?

598
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:09,330
Oh, Sophie, please.
Let's not fall apart, okay?

599
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,498
Gee, lzzy...

600
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:16,753
...to tell you the truth,
I fell apart a while ago.

601
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,804
So, what did the monsignor say?

602
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,969
I told him that Pop always kept
a gun in his office...

603
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,805
...and he kept large amounts of cash.

604
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,602
And while he was cleaning the gun...

605
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,315
...it accidentally went off.

606
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,538
Hey.

607
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,449
Easy, Gray.

608
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,411
You sound like
you're starting to believe that.

609
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:20,813
It is time to go.
The lama is waiting for you.

610
01:09:59,984 --> 01:10:01,941
There is a hut in the mountain.

611
01:10:03,154 --> 01:10:06,071
The lama likes you to go there.

612
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,780
I packed your books.

613
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:08,215
I am sad...

614
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:12,340
...because I am losing my cook.

615
01:14:16,231 --> 01:14:18,105
Yes, I'm leaving.

616
01:14:19,776 --> 01:14:21,519
Isn't it true...

617
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:26,065
...it is easy to be a holy man
on the top of a mountain?

618
01:14:26,991 --> 01:14:29,114
You are closer than you think.

619
01:14:29,994 --> 01:14:33,280
The path to salvation is narrow
and as difficult to walk...

620
01:14:33,456 --> 01:14:35,532
...as a razor's edge.

621
01:15:44,983 --> 01:15:47,474
Good God, Romulus and Remus.

622
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:50,235
Now, Joseph, you see...

623
01:15:50,405 --> 01:15:53,821
...this is not fit for a gerbil.

624
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:58,534
That, on the other hand,
minus an outer leaf or two...

625
01:15:58,705 --> 01:16:03,781
...is positively Rousseauvian
in its beauty, and at half the price.

626
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,578
Pay the man. Half what he asks you.

627
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,343
Hello, boys.

628
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:23,262
Good God, Darrell, I was under
the impression that you'd vanished.

629
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,641
You know that Isabel
is here in Paris with me?

630
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,651
This wretched Depression
cleaned them out.

631
01:16:30,193 --> 01:16:31,652
Poor old Gray lost everything.

632
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:35,520
Gray? Gray Maturin and Isabel?

633
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:39,567
And they have two children.

634
01:16:39,744 --> 01:16:42,496
Gray hasn't worked
for two-and-a-half years.

635
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:46,659
But I can see you're busy.
I'll give your best to everyone.

636
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:48,578
Come, Joseph.

637
01:16:50,922 --> 01:16:52,831
Look, why don't you...

638
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:57,460
...take a wash and drop by sometime.

639
01:17:13,985 --> 01:17:15,184
Thank you.

640
01:17:15,362 --> 01:17:17,354
Would you tell your mother
Uncle Larry is here?

641
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:18,989
- Okay.
- Yeah.

642
01:17:19,157 --> 01:17:22,158
Mama, Mama, Uncle Larry's here!

643
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:25,491
Thanks, girls.
You go out and play, all right?

644
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:52,471
I was hoping you might stop by.

645
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,558
Well, I had to make sure the children
didn't look too much like Gray.

646
01:18:01,907 --> 01:18:04,861
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

647
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,038
Honey?

648
01:18:20,883 --> 01:18:22,508
Larry.

649
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:26,634
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

650
01:18:26,806 --> 01:18:30,009
I was downstairs this morning.
Wish you'd caught me then.

651
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:33,342
Got another one
of my damn headaches.

652
01:18:34,688 --> 01:18:37,013
Sometimes they're so bad...

653
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:39,397
...I feel like I'm gonna die.

654
01:18:40,485 --> 01:18:42,395
Sometimes I wish I was dead.

655
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:46,073
Gray, sometimes all of us
wish you were dead.

656
01:18:49,411 --> 01:18:52,246
What are you doing here?
This is guy talk.

657
01:18:52,414 --> 01:18:55,580
We're gonna talk about girls.
We don't want you around. Bye.

658
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,995
Bye.

659
01:18:58,878 --> 01:19:00,752
How are you doing?

660
01:19:00,922 --> 01:19:02,879
Not bad, for me.

661
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:06,751
You haven't tried aspirin
for these headaches?

662
01:19:10,556 --> 01:19:12,513
I've got something that might work.

663
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:15,184
Here.

664
01:19:21,525 --> 01:19:25,225
Hold it in your hand.
Clasp your fingers tightly around it.

665
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,738
Hand out, palm down.

666
01:19:30,117 --> 01:19:32,109
No big deal. I'm gonna count to 10.

667
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:35,741
And before I get to 10,
you're gonna drop the coin.

668
01:19:36,456 --> 01:19:41,414
One, two, three, four...

669
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:45,084
...five, six...

670
01:19:45,256 --> 01:19:47,249
...seven, eight...

671
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:57,760
- How did you do that?
- I didn't do it. You did it.

672
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:00,935
Here's what you're gonna do next.

673
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,394
Hold the coin in your hand again.
Gently, this time.

674
01:20:07,444 --> 01:20:09,733
Let your hand rest on your lap.

675
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,113
Lie back.

676
01:20:13,617 --> 01:20:15,027
Relax.

677
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:18,825
Relax your whole body.

678
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,865
Your eyelids are gonna get heavy.

679
01:20:24,127 --> 01:20:25,621
They're going to close.

680
01:20:27,171 --> 01:20:28,998
You're going to sleep...

681
01:20:29,632 --> 01:20:31,376
...for three minutes.

682
01:20:32,802 --> 01:20:34,960
And when you wake up...

683
01:20:36,305 --> 01:20:38,262
...your headache will be gone.

684
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,456
Where'd it go?

685
01:21:47,624 --> 01:21:49,747
God, it's good
to see her smile again.

686
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:54,086
- It's good to have you back.
- It's good to have you back.

687
01:21:54,255 --> 01:21:55,880
Nice being here.

688
01:21:58,051 --> 01:21:59,461
Okay, now we go here.

689
01:21:59,635 --> 01:22:03,633
Oh, hey, go and tickle
Uncle Larry like crazy.

690
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:08,720
Oh, children, children,
Monsieur Larry is not ticklish.

691
01:22:11,897 --> 01:22:13,890
You traitor.

692
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:17,647
- Oh, mama. Your mommy's ticklish.
- No!

693
01:22:17,945 --> 01:22:19,522
Mama is very ticklish.

694
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,666
Thank you, Joseph.

695
01:22:40,633 --> 01:22:43,303
There's a lot of energy
in this place. I feel it.

696
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:48,678
A little less than there was
a minute ago.

697
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:50,723
Oh, Larry.

698
01:22:50,893 --> 01:22:53,016
This is good. You're gonna like this.

699
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,505
Well, for chrissake.

700
01:24:24,608 --> 01:24:26,648
Sophie.

701
01:24:28,445 --> 01:24:29,988
Larry.

702
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:32,906
Goddamn.

703
01:24:33,075 --> 01:24:35,566
I thought you were dead
or something worse.

704
01:24:35,744 --> 01:24:40,536
- What are you doing in Paris?
- Our old friends didn't tell you?

705
01:24:40,707 --> 01:24:43,032
I guess it must have
slipped their minds.

706
01:24:45,212 --> 01:24:47,121
Been trying to call you lately.

707
01:24:48,006 --> 01:24:50,793
I even came around to the house
the other night, but I guess...

708
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:53,339
...it was a little late for you.

709
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:08,271
- How have you been, Sophie?
- I've been having a regular riot, lzzy.

710
01:25:09,902 --> 01:25:12,358
My loving in-laws ran me
out of Chicago.

711
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,937
They didn't care for my behaviour.

712
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:21,245
Our old friends here don't care
for my behaviour either, but...

713
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,287
...that's okay.

714
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,496
I got lots of new friends.

715
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,618
How's Bob?

716
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:31,584
Bob?

717
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,465
Oh, Bob...

718
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:46,259
Been having a regular riot too,
isn't he, Gray?

719
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:52,438
There was an accident.

720
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:56,520
Bob and Matthew were killed.

721
01:26:02,327 --> 01:26:05,281
Sophie's been under
a lot of strain lately.

722
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:10,995
I've been under a lot of strain?
Honey, you looked in a mirror lately?

723
01:26:20,261 --> 01:26:22,503
You will excuse my little friend.

724
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,088
Sometimes she smokes too much
of the Chinaman's pipe.

725
01:26:28,686 --> 01:26:31,011
Perhaps you find her amusing.

726
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:34,604
Would you like a private room
upstairs? Forty francs.

727
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:39,105
- Twenty for her, 20 for the linen.
- How dare you!

728
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,197
You bastard, why don't you just
get the hell out of here.

729
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:45,153
- But see, we're old friends of Sophie's.
- For you, 30 francs.

730
01:26:46,537 --> 01:26:48,613
- Okay, deal.
- For 30 minutes.

731
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:53,498
Don't kid with Coco. He doesn't
have much of a sense of humour.

732
01:26:54,795 --> 01:26:56,455
Got a clock, Coco?

733
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:58,124
In my head, monsieur.

734
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:00,998
Doesn't leave room
for much else, does it?

735
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:11,135
Gee, you were right.
You just can't kid with Coco.

736
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:30,487
Let's call it an evening. Okay?

737
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,998
We'd like to go home, Joseph.

738
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,096
Not so fast, you're our ride home.

739
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:05,107
It occurred to me that I wouldn't
have to pay for the linen at my place.

740
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:31,712
You sure you both don't wanna
come to our house?

741
01:28:31,888 --> 01:28:33,263
- We'll be fine.
- Good night.

742
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:56,952
Come on, let's run.

743
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:05,124
You think I can't run.

744
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:16,010
Here, here, go ahead.
Come on. Come on.

745
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,298
Where the hell do you live anyway?

746
01:29:20,685 --> 01:29:22,927
It's this set of steps and one other.

747
01:29:26,733 --> 01:29:32,071
Hey! I didn't tell you about
the incredible view that I have.

748
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:34,230
You've never seen anything like it.

749
01:29:38,035 --> 01:29:41,238
Larry, you don't know
where I've been.

750
01:29:45,459 --> 01:29:50,204
Get up these stairs! Get up there!

751
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:54,914
Come on, come on.

752
01:29:55,093 --> 01:29:57,880
It's kind of a bachelor's place,
but I'll go straighten up.

753
01:30:01,099 --> 01:30:02,724
What a dump.

754
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:19,190
Are we there...? Are we there yet?

755
01:30:22,495 --> 01:30:25,614
Almost. Bring that up
for me, will you?

756
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,649
Lance Romance, huh?

757
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,236
Would you care to dance?

758
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:42,110
- You know...
- Get me out of here!

759
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,898
...It's getting hard to find an apartment
that doesn't have hot water...

760
01:31:46,075 --> 01:31:48,281
...but I found this fabulous landlord.

761
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:52,495
That is refreshing, isn't it?

762
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:56,450
You bastard!

763
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:19,558
Larry?

764
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:29,734
Larry?

765
01:32:46,008 --> 01:32:48,131
Oh, thanks. Big trouble.

766
01:32:48,886 --> 01:32:52,052
The landlord's making me paint the
place. You're gonna have to help.

767
01:32:52,222 --> 01:32:54,215
- Paint?
- Yeah.

768
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:56,964
Oh, yeah, okay,
I'll be back in about an hour.

769
01:32:57,144 --> 01:33:00,844
Who do you think you're talking to?
Mr. Coco? "I'll be back in an hour"?

770
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:02,481
"See you in 60, Coc," huh?

771
01:33:02,649 --> 01:33:05,021
Larry, goddamn it, I've got to go!

772
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,604
What about last night, princess?
You think that was for free?

773
01:33:10,615 --> 01:33:13,532
You're on the painting team. Get it?

774
01:33:14,077 --> 01:33:16,650
You don't think I would give you
your freedom...

775
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:19,154
...if this painting thing
hadn't come up?

776
01:33:29,717 --> 01:33:31,626
What do you think of white?

777
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:35,669
Right.

778
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:51,418
Pretty good.

779
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:33,288
No.

780
01:36:00,028 --> 01:36:02,186
Yes or no? Yes or no?

781
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:10,577
You're not gonna like this either,
are you? You don't like this, do you?

782
01:36:19,046 --> 01:36:21,253
Now, that I like.

783
01:36:26,804 --> 01:36:30,504
You like exercise?
You're gonna love our place.

784
01:36:38,607 --> 01:36:40,065
Hey, honey.

785
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:43,726
I thought I'd whip you up some lunch.

786
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:48,652
Aren't I the thoughtful,
domestic type?

787
01:36:52,745 --> 01:36:54,121
You smell nice.

788
01:37:32,575 --> 01:37:34,615
Squaw, fix dinner.

789
01:37:35,078 --> 01:37:37,403
- Okay.
- Nice job on canoe.

790
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,205
Just one thing, chief.

791
01:37:41,459 --> 01:37:44,294
That's wet paint you're sitting on.

792
01:38:18,411 --> 01:38:20,736
When Bob and the baby died, I...

793
01:38:22,332 --> 01:38:25,368
I went to such a black place.

794
01:38:33,759 --> 01:38:36,167
It was almost like...

795
01:38:36,345 --> 01:38:38,172
Like I felt I deserved it or something.

796
01:38:38,347 --> 01:38:40,174
I don't know why.

797
01:38:40,349 --> 01:38:44,892
And then I was trying
to justify it somehow.

798
01:38:47,314 --> 01:38:51,442
Like, by proving to myself
that I was a really bad person.

799
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,816
I did deserve it.

800
01:38:58,366 --> 01:38:59,991
Jeez.

801
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,492
You've given me so much, Larry.

802
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:09,828
It's very easy to love
someone like you.

803
01:39:10,003 --> 01:39:11,378
Yeah.

804
01:39:35,444 --> 01:39:37,317
I think we should have used
the back door.

805
01:39:37,487 --> 01:39:39,444
We'll probably have to use it
to get out.

806
01:39:41,158 --> 01:39:43,316
I think the market's doing very well.

807
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:46,198
Darling, your hand is perspiring.

808
01:39:46,371 --> 01:39:48,743
- Larry.
- You can drink if you want to.

809
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,915
- Hi.
- Hi, Sophie.

810
01:39:53,878 --> 01:39:56,914
- Sophie, my dear, it's been far too long.
- Mr. Templeton...

811
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:58,584
...you haven't changed a bit.

812
01:39:58,758 --> 01:40:00,916
Well, you certainly have.

813
01:40:02,511 --> 01:40:05,133
I just mean that I don't recall you
being such a fibber...

814
01:40:05,306 --> 01:40:06,966
...about an old man's looks.

815
01:40:08,184 --> 01:40:09,975
Cocktail, Mr. Templeton?

816
01:40:10,144 --> 01:40:13,310
No, thank you, Albert.
I fear my drinking days are over.

817
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:19,143
Surely, a tear of ZubrÃ³wka
could do monsieur no harm.

818
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:20,517
ZubrÃ³wka!

819
01:40:20,696 --> 01:40:24,693
We used to drink it at the Radziwill's
when I stayed there for the shooting.

820
01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:28,235
I don't suppose a drop will hurt me.
Oh, we must all try some.

821
01:40:39,088 --> 01:40:41,758
- Oh, not for me. Thanks.
- Oh, my dear, you must.

822
01:40:41,924 --> 01:40:44,332
No. Thanks anyway.

823
01:40:45,052 --> 01:40:49,299
The herbs.
It's like newly mown lavender.

824
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:52,676
Well, what shall we drink to?

825
01:40:52,852 --> 01:40:55,473
We could drink to Sophie's
and my wedding.

826
01:40:57,856 --> 01:41:00,394
That's swell!

827
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:02,892
Congratulations!

828
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:06,439
Golly! Imagine that!

829
01:41:08,533 --> 01:41:10,775
When is the happy occasion?

830
01:41:10,952 --> 01:41:12,945
We're going to do it Friday.

831
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:16,362
Friday?

832
01:41:21,004 --> 01:41:22,664
Oh, I think that's wonderful.

833
01:41:25,383 --> 01:41:26,877
I'd like to...

834
01:41:27,635 --> 01:41:31,218
...take you to Molyneux's after lunch
and pick out your dress.

835
01:41:31,389 --> 01:41:35,007
Gray and I would love to give it to you
as a wedding present, wouldn't we?

836
01:41:36,352 --> 01:41:38,759
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, don't be silly.

837
01:41:38,938 --> 01:41:41,855
I mean, after all,
you two are our oldest friends.

838
01:41:43,525 --> 01:41:46,396
Well, I really don't think
it's gonna be that kind of wedding...

839
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:48,977
...where I'll need a new dress, right?

840
01:41:49,156 --> 01:41:51,065
- So thanks anyway.
- Don't be stupid, Sophie!

841
01:41:51,241 --> 01:41:53,649
You've gotta wear something!
You can't wear that!

842
01:42:01,042 --> 01:42:02,501
Honey.

843
01:42:03,753 --> 01:42:05,331
Honey...

844
01:42:05,922 --> 01:42:08,757
...maybe Sophie
doesn't want a new dress.

845
01:42:19,435 --> 01:42:21,059
Okay.

846
01:42:22,855 --> 01:42:24,053
That'll be nice.

847
01:42:27,401 --> 01:42:28,895
Good.

848
01:42:30,863 --> 01:42:32,273
We'll go after lunch.

849
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:34,609
- Great.
- Well...

850
01:42:38,078 --> 01:42:39,821
Cheers.

851
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:53,674
Uncle Elliot, you were right.
That's the best thing I've ever tasted.

852
01:42:53,843 --> 01:42:56,215
I don't mind simply looking at it.

853
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,881
I'll have Albert order up a bottle
for the house. You can take it with you.

854
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:05,931
Albert, have them place a bottle
of this ambrosia in my car, please.

855
01:43:09,316 --> 01:43:12,021
It's like listening to music
by moonlight.

856
01:43:27,667 --> 01:43:29,826
- Pretty nice place.
- Oh, thank you.

857
01:43:30,003 --> 01:43:32,708
Make yourself at home.
I'm gonna check on the kids.

858
01:43:32,881 --> 01:43:34,838
It's really Uncle Elliot.
He's been incredible.

859
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:37,249
I don't know what we would have
done without him.

860
01:43:53,192 --> 01:43:55,480
Afraid I rearranged
your knickknacks.

861
01:43:58,781 --> 01:44:01,450
You wanna break
anything else, Soph?

862
01:44:04,786 --> 01:44:08,535
Okay. Let's get this over with, huh?

863
01:44:08,915 --> 01:44:12,331
- I know all you really want is Larry.
- That's ridiculous.

864
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,707
I think it's actually quite fitting
that you two found each other...

865
01:44:16,881 --> 01:44:18,541
...after all these years.

866
01:44:20,176 --> 01:44:23,675
Isabel, I know
you're in love with him.

867
01:44:24,889 --> 01:44:27,641
You've always been in love with him.

868
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:34,388
I wonder who else has always
been in love with him.

869
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:38,016
And what if I am in love with him?

870
01:44:38,652 --> 01:44:40,194
And what if I can't see...

871
01:44:40,362 --> 01:44:43,363
...how you're going to be able to
stand by him when things get tough?

872
01:44:43,532 --> 01:44:45,192
How would you know?

873
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:57,540
When he wanted you,
you walked out on him.

874
01:44:57,712 --> 01:45:01,580
I walked out on him? Oh, no,
I sacrificed myself for him.

875
01:45:01,758 --> 01:45:03,964
Oh, come on, honey.

876
01:45:04,177 --> 01:45:05,837
Honey.

877
01:45:06,471 --> 01:45:10,053
You sacrificed yourself
for a mink-fucking-coat...

878
01:45:10,224 --> 01:45:12,894
...and a set of monogrammed towels.

879
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:15,017
I wanted to be a wife,
and I wanted children.

880
01:45:15,187 --> 01:45:17,643
Now, maybe that's something
that you can't understand.

881
01:45:17,982 --> 01:45:19,227
That's not true, Isabel.

882
01:45:20,818 --> 01:45:23,143
Larry wanted to give you that.

883
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:25,229
I was a good wife.

884
01:45:26,532 --> 01:45:28,441
I was a good mother.

885
01:45:29,827 --> 01:45:31,404
I'm gonna be one again.

886
01:45:31,578 --> 01:45:34,912
Bob got you pregnant.
You made the best of the situation.

887
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:38,242
Do you really think he was happy?

888
01:45:41,671 --> 01:45:43,415
Oh, Sophie.

889
01:45:47,594 --> 01:45:49,503
What can I say?

890
01:45:50,263 --> 01:45:53,133
I just do not believe that you
will not drag him down eventually.

891
01:45:58,437 --> 01:46:00,395
Your drinking alone.

892
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:05,485
I haven't...

893
01:46:06,237 --> 01:46:07,980
...had a drink in three months.

894
01:46:08,155 --> 01:46:09,898
That's great.

895
01:46:10,449 --> 01:46:12,987
But you've wanted one, haven't you?

896
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:15,077
Haven't you?

897
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:19,871
And you will again and again.

898
01:46:21,376 --> 01:46:24,626
And again. What about the drugs?

899
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,919
And what about everything else?

900
01:46:30,468 --> 01:46:31,749
Larry helps me.

901
01:46:32,846 --> 01:46:34,803
I know Larry helps you.

902
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,677
I can see him devoting
the rest of his life to helping you...

903
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:45,809
...and never whispering
one word of regret ever.

904
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:49,027
Can't you?

905
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:51,188
Telephone, Mrs. Maturin.

906
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,955
Hello? Oh, yes.

907
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,210
This is Mrs. Maturin.

908
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:11,256
Oh, yes.

909
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:14,250
Oh, that's wonderful.

910
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,075
That was the children's dentist.

911
01:47:39,243 --> 01:47:41,152
There's been a cancellation...

912
01:47:42,037 --> 01:47:44,528
...and I've been trying
to get an appointment for weeks.

913
01:47:45,832 --> 01:47:47,457
Wait for me, please.

914
01:47:48,126 --> 01:47:50,285
Joseph will bring you
some tea, and...

915
01:47:51,296 --> 01:47:53,372
And when I get back, we'll go.

916
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,633
Maybe some other time, huh?

917
01:47:58,803 --> 01:48:00,179
No, Sophie.

918
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,596
If you're going to get married, then...

919
01:48:05,226 --> 01:48:07,384
...I'm going to buy you the dress.

920
01:48:23,327 --> 01:48:24,821
Yes, madam?

921
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,672
Nothing.

922
01:50:48,175 --> 01:50:49,918
Come on, Sophie.

923
01:50:50,427 --> 01:50:51,969
Leave me alone.

924
01:50:55,265 --> 01:50:57,637
Can't you see?

925
01:50:57,809 --> 01:51:01,225
I'm listening to music by moonlight.

926
01:51:04,274 --> 01:51:06,266
Oh, Isabel...

927
01:51:06,943 --> 01:51:09,730
...you were so right.

928
01:51:11,405 --> 01:51:13,694
She was right about
everything, you know.

929
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:17,326
Let's go, Sophie.

930
01:51:18,913 --> 01:51:20,952
Don't you hear the music?

931
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:23,791
No, I guess not.

932
01:51:24,501 --> 01:51:26,873
All you ever hear
are choirs of angels.

933
01:51:29,089 --> 01:51:30,797
Well...

934
01:51:30,966 --> 01:51:33,539
...Coco here is my angel.

935
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:35,711
Aren't you, mon chÃ©ri?

936
01:51:40,392 --> 01:51:42,384
Don't you wanna go home?

937
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:52,437
Home?

938
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:59,484
This is my home.

939
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:02,076
I like it here.

940
01:52:04,707 --> 01:52:07,114
Right here in Coco's lap.

941
01:52:07,793 --> 01:52:09,750
It's the biggest...

942
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:11,753
...warmest...

943
01:52:12,381 --> 01:52:14,208
...lap in town.

944
01:52:14,758 --> 01:52:16,169
Wanna feel it?

945
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:21,678
Why don't you just run along, Larry.

946
01:52:24,809 --> 01:52:28,143
We don't need you here.
Nobody wants you here.

947
01:52:38,573 --> 01:52:40,150
We just...

948
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:46,280
...wanna listen to music
by moonlight.

949
01:52:49,667 --> 01:52:51,042
Larry!

950
01:52:52,086 --> 01:52:54,411
No! Larry!

951
01:53:55,689 --> 01:53:58,096
Monsieur Darrell, we are the police.

952
01:54:03,154 --> 01:54:05,230
Yeah, I noticed your shoes.

953
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:18,168
We dragged her body from the river.

954
01:54:25,092 --> 01:54:26,372
What?

955
01:54:26,552 --> 01:54:29,007
Her throat was cut with a razor.

956
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:33,265
It could have been
any one of her friends.

957
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:35,924
They are the vermin of the city.

958
01:54:37,771 --> 01:54:41,555
What was your relationship
to the deceased?

959
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:54,870
She was my fiancÃ©e.

960
01:56:08,692 --> 01:56:10,102
Good, Larry's here.

961
01:56:10,819 --> 01:56:12,527
Thank you, Your Grace.

962
01:56:13,446 --> 01:56:15,652
Elliot's had a stroke.

963
01:56:15,823 --> 01:56:18,824
The bishop just gave him
the last rites.

964
01:56:18,993 --> 01:56:21,033
Isabel's in pretty bad shape.

965
01:56:23,664 --> 01:56:27,247
Oh, Larry, he's going fast...

966
01:56:27,418 --> 01:56:30,288
...and I don't want him to die sad.

967
01:56:30,463 --> 01:56:33,084
All his friends have forgotten him.

968
01:56:33,257 --> 01:56:37,586
He waited for weeks for an invitation
to Princess Novemali's party.

969
01:56:37,761 --> 01:56:39,920
I knew it wouldn't come.

970
01:56:40,097 --> 01:56:41,971
People think him a silly man, Larry...

971
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,466
...but he's a good man...

972
01:56:44,643 --> 01:56:46,434
...and a generous one.

973
01:57:22,096 --> 01:57:24,005
I'm gonna miss him so much.

974
01:57:25,933 --> 01:57:28,768
I wish I'd been a better friend to him.

975
01:57:33,231 --> 01:57:36,647
- Like you were to Sophie?
- Is she okay?

976
01:57:38,236 --> 01:57:41,320
When I came back yesterday
afternoon, she'd gone.

977
01:57:42,991 --> 01:57:46,276
- What happened to your face?
- She's gone for good.

978
01:57:47,829 --> 01:57:50,320
- What?
- She met up with some old friends.

979
01:57:50,498 --> 01:57:54,116
They got her drinking, slit her throat
and dropped her in the Seine.

980
01:57:54,752 --> 01:57:56,294
Oh, my God!

981
01:57:56,462 --> 01:57:59,249
I don't give a damn
if they catch who killed her.

982
01:58:00,758 --> 01:58:03,463
What I wanna know is how you
got her to take the first drink.

983
01:58:06,555 --> 01:58:09,426
What'd you do, get her going
on Bob and the baby?

984
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:14,265
Did you get her down
and keep her there?

985
01:58:19,401 --> 01:58:21,144
I broke this chair once...

986
01:58:23,405 --> 01:58:26,489
...because I couldn't spend
the rest of my life with you.

987
01:58:29,452 --> 01:58:32,738
Sooner or later,
she would have let you down.

988
01:58:32,914 --> 01:58:35,535
I wanted you to see that.

989
01:58:36,459 --> 01:58:38,950
I've never stopped
thinking about you.

990
01:58:46,635 --> 01:58:48,711
I love you.

991
01:58:53,517 --> 01:58:55,972
I just wanted you to be happy.

992
01:58:56,145 --> 01:58:59,062
I didn't want anyone else to hurt you.

993
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:08,904
So you killed my fiancÃ©e for me?

994
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:11,821
Just like you killed my fiancÃ©.

995
01:59:13,244 --> 01:59:16,993
I was in love with Larry Darrell,
but you had to take him away...

996
01:59:17,165 --> 01:59:20,865
...to go and find the meaning
of his goddamn life.

997
01:59:25,089 --> 01:59:26,287
Honey...

998
01:59:29,427 --> 01:59:31,419
I'm afraid you'd better come.

999
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,293
How you doing, Unc?

1000
02:00:16,847 --> 02:00:19,765
Life is full of ironies,
isn't it, Darrell?

1001
02:00:21,268 --> 02:00:23,059
You know...

1002
02:00:23,228 --> 02:00:25,980
...I spent my whole life...

1003
02:00:26,148 --> 02:00:29,232
...among the great names of Europe.

1004
02:00:32,195 --> 02:00:34,520
Now I'm dying...

1005
02:00:34,698 --> 02:00:37,189
...and who comes to see me but a...

1006
02:00:37,367 --> 02:00:40,036
Well, I mean...

1007
02:00:41,788 --> 02:00:43,615
An itinerant...

1008
02:00:44,707 --> 02:00:47,079
- Fish packer?
- Fish packer.

1009
02:00:50,671 --> 02:00:52,379
Oh, I got some mail for you.

1010
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:54,964
Some old buzzard came to the door...

1011
02:00:55,134 --> 02:00:57,672
...while I was downstairs
raiding your icebox.

1012
02:00:58,345 --> 02:01:00,053
Who's Novemali?

1013
02:01:03,142 --> 02:01:05,015
"Princess Novemali...

1014
02:01:05,185 --> 02:01:06,977
...kindly requests the..."

1015
02:01:07,730 --> 02:01:09,188
Costume party?

1016
02:01:09,356 --> 02:01:12,855
You're not gonna get out that old
rabbit outfit of yours, are you?

1017
02:01:14,903 --> 02:01:19,031
R.S.V.P. The princess's palace,
I guess, Joe.

1018
02:01:23,536 --> 02:01:26,110
Get your pad, Joseph.
We must reply.

1019
02:01:26,289 --> 02:01:27,783
Oh, not now, Uncle Elliot.

1020
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:32,200
My dear, I've always been
a man of the world...

1021
02:01:32,378 --> 02:01:36,127
...and I see no reason to forget
my manners now that I'm leaving it.

1022
02:01:36,299 --> 02:01:38,090
Are you ready, Joseph?

1023
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:43,009
Monsieur Elliot Templeton...

1024
02:01:44,306 --> 02:01:45,884
...regrets he is unable...

1025
02:01:47,184 --> 02:01:53,020
...to accept Princess Novemali's
kind invitation...

1026
02:01:55,692 --> 02:02:01,232
...due to a previous engagement
with his blessed Lord.

1027
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:05,193
The old bitch.

1028
02:02:52,289 --> 02:02:54,032
The children.

1029
02:03:01,506 --> 02:03:03,415
When Piedmont died...

1030
02:03:05,259 --> 02:03:07,833
...I had to pay him back for my life.

1031
02:03:11,766 --> 02:03:14,802
I found out there's
another debt to pay...

1032
02:03:14,977 --> 02:03:17,682
...for the privilege of being alive.

1033
02:03:22,025 --> 02:03:23,817
I thought Sophie...

1034
02:03:23,986 --> 02:03:27,189
...was my reward for trying
to live a good life.

1035
02:03:33,829 --> 02:03:35,868
There is no payoff.

1036
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:40,286
Not now.

1037
02:03:43,546 --> 02:03:45,918
Am I ever gonna see you again?

1038
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:50,634
Isabel...

1039
02:03:51,262 --> 02:03:53,136
...you just don't get it.

1040
02:03:56,142 --> 02:03:58,181
It doesn't matter.

1041
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:01,179
It doesn't matter.

1042
02:04:35,263 --> 02:04:38,845
- Is she okay?
- She will be as soon as you go up.

1043
02:04:40,267 --> 02:04:42,307
What happened, Larry?

1044
02:04:42,478 --> 02:04:44,305
Isabel's gonna tell you.

1045
02:04:46,065 --> 02:04:47,689
You know something?

1046
02:04:49,151 --> 02:04:52,401
You two are the best friends
I've ever had.

1047
02:04:52,571 --> 02:04:55,488
Gray, that's just the luck of the draw.

1048
02:04:56,533 --> 02:04:58,324
Oh, I tell you...

1049
02:05:00,579 --> 02:05:02,536
- See you.
- Yeah.

1050
02:05:09,087 --> 02:05:11,542
Hey, pal, that's my coat.

1051
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,252
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

1052
02:05:17,428 --> 02:05:19,717
Where are you going now, Larry?

1053
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:22,384
I'm going home.

1054
02:05:22,558 --> 02:05:24,681
But where is your home, Larry?

1055
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:30,314
America.

1056
02:09:04,522 --> 02:09:06,598
