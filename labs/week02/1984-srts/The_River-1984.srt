1
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,594
Heavy rain continues to
batter the tri-state area.

2
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,235
Severe thunderstorms have dumped 8.6
inches of rain in the last 12 hours.

3
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,841
Flooding is reported in Fulton,
Rolling Fork and Osborne.

4
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,565
Watch out, Tom!

5
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,043
Beth, get in
the truck.

6
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:54,678
Tom!

7
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:57,580
Are you hurt?

8
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,987
I'm all right.

9
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:02,914
My leg's caught.

10
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,358
Which one?

11
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,126
The left one.

12
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,186
I'll tell you what.

13
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,964
Both of you hold me under the
shoulders and pull like hell.

14
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:16,761
It should come out.

15
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:52,769
Dad, it's going!

16
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,452
Lewis,
grab his leg! Pull!

17
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,257
Try again.

18
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:33,711
Daddy.

19
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,453
Tom,
you okay?

20
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,485
I'm fine.

21
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,853
I'll get Beth.

22
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,230
We'll get
the animals.

23
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,537
Come on, honey.

24
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:04,802
I have to save Ernie.

25
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,371
We'll get him.

26
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:08,025
Hang onto me.

27
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,645
Tight. Okay.

28
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:23,898
You get behind
Jessica.

29
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,927
Hey, up!

30
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,669
Come on, get up!

31
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:44,314
Take this quilt upstairs,
Beth. Put it in my room.

32
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,720
Ya! Get out!

33
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,079
Stay close to me.

34
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,124
Oh, Lord.

35
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,969
Be careful.

36
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,881
Welcome back,
Senator.

37
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,116
Thank you, son.

38
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,929
Hop in, Senator.

39
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,965
Morning, Joe.
Morning.

40
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,989
Where's
your regular pilot?

41
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,978
He's not feeling
too good, Ed.

42
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:57,749
But don't worry. I'm sure I can
figure out how this thing works.

43
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:54,107
All this bottom land used to be
duck marsh back 200 years ago.

44
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:59,645
Natural springs all
over it. Real fine water.

45
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,979
How many farms
flooded, Joe?

46
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,660
What do you figure,
Harve?

47
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,924
Maybe eight, nine all told.

48
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,154
It's the same
as always.

49
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:15,888
They'll all be at my
bank asking for money.

50
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,442
Those are the Garveys
down there.

51
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,847
Hard-working guy,
Tom Garvey.

52
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,349
Stubborn son of a bitch.

53
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,247
That's Joe Wade.

54
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,918
The flying farmer.

55
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,758
What's he doing here?

56
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,827
Showing off.

57
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,590
Why did you
show me that, Joe?

58
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:28,692
I'm sitting on 11,000 acres
of good, productive farmland

59
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,967
and I'm running out
of water.

60
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:35,466
My aquifer's going dry. I'm too
far from the river to irrigate.

61
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,173
We've got to
build us a dam.

62
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:40,971
Wait a minute.

63
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:49,656
You flood that valley,
what happens to the farmers?

64
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,889
They'll get a fair price
for their land.

65
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,030
It's not just irrigation
for myself.

66
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:01,099
I'm talking about enough
hydroelectric power for the county.

67
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,538
I'm talking about jobs.

68
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,671
Could mean a lot
to everybody.

69
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,706
Including yourself.

70
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,053
I'll look into it.

71
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:28,220
You're a smart man, Joe.

72
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,453
So are you, Senator.

73
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,290
That's why we put you
in the state house.

74
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,943
No loafing
in front of the bank.

75
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:47,504
Move on. Won't get no work sitting here.

76
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,258
Can I have
some ice cream?

77
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:52,835
When Daddy's
finished.

78
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,378
When will he
be finished?

79
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,511
When he's done.

80
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,923
He'll be finished
soon.

81
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,559
Good morning, Mae.

82
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,495
Joe.
Hi, kids.

83
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,160
Saw you took
some water.

84
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:43,902
Could have
been worse.

85
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:46,207
Anything I can do?

86
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,268
We'll manage.

87
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,275
Okay.

88
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,024
You need $9,700?

89
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:08,819
I got to plant a new crop
and fix the 'dozer.

90
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,060
It's all there
on the list.

91
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,889
Three hundred
and twenty acres.

92
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:18,531
Borrowed $60,000 in 1970,
a second for $18,500 in '76.

93
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:23,100
$214,000 worth of
farm equipment

94
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:27,104
on which you have paid
only $16,300.

95
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,945
Yeah.

96
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,818
You owe us
a lot of money, Tom.

97
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,313
I'd like to help you.

98
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,294
If we give you another loan,
how will you make the payments?

99
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:45,088
I'm a good customer...
I know that.

100
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,224
I've made payments
for 12 years.

101
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,459
That's not
the point.

102
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:49,994
That's the point.

103
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,800
Ten years ago, you begged
me to borrow the money.

104
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,712
It's different now.
Land values are down.

105
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,678
You owe us more
than your place is worth.

106
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:08,812
You turning me down?

107
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,112
Take it easy.

108
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:11,382
You're putting me
out of business.

109
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,982
Lower your voice.

110
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,724
I need that loan.
I earned it.

111
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:27,564
Leutzcorp might give you
a good price for your land.

112
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:29,907
Talk to Joe Wade.

113
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,137
I'm not looking to sell.
I'm looking to stay.

114
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:51,765
I don't know what
we can do for you, Tom.

115
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,625
We can roll
your notes over.

116
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,468
Just talk to Wade.

117
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,381
What did you
come in for?

118
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,850
Wanted him to
see us.

119
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,285
Don't guess
it helped.

120
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,823
It sure didn't.

121
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,326
Neither did this.

122
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,192
Can I have
my ice cream now?

123
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:29,825
No, honey.

124
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,196
She said when
Dad was finished.

125
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,003
Aren't you
finished, Dad?

126
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:35,776
No, Beth,
I'm not finished!

127
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:46,988
Come on out.

128
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,917
Go get yourself
an ice cream.

129
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,794
Hold her hand,
Lewis.

130
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:14,381
You look real handsome.

131
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,087
I gave you
a great haircut.

132
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:29,862
It itches.

133
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:43,471
It's time to eat.

134
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,963
That's great, honey.

135
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,965
Put it up
on the rolling pin.

136
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,573
Like this.
That's great.

137
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,776
That's
a beautiful crust.

138
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:26,511
Cut the edges off.

139
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,179
Wade didn't waste
any time, did he?

140
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,649
Howard must have called him
as soon as I left the bank.

141
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:11,962
We'd come away clean
with about $25,000.

142
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,368
It's more like $28,000.

143
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,066
How many times
did you read this?

144
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:29,144
Sometimes I think we'd
do better someplace else.

145
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,349
Away from the river.

146
00:22:33,343 --> 00:22:35,254
I'm not interested.

147
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,402
Because the offer
came from him?

148
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:56,471
This is
our home place, Mae.

149
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,973
My people
are buried here.

150
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:57,132
Beth, what do you
got there?

151
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,737
Take that
back inside.

152
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,351
It's only a quilt.

153
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,661
It's not for sale.

154
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,902
What do you got?

155
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:09,940
Pears, applesauce,
blackberry jam.

156
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,873
Lewis, come here.

157
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,945
Put the jam back
in the kitchen.

158
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,727
Like my jam, huh?

159
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:26,425
Yeah.

160
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:04,202
There's more of
them every day.

161
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:08,569
Where are
they coming from?

162
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,736
A lot of them
look like farmers.

163
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:15,337
I got three, now four, four.

164
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:18,842
Anybody got four,
now, five, six?

165
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:20,811
Looking for seven, seven?

166
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:21,977
Over here!

167
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:23,380
Seven and a half.

168
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:24,579
Eight.

169
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,782
Anybody go eight and a half?

170
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,763
Anybody go nine,
nine, nine, nine?

171
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,961
Did you tie this?

172
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,296
It's a tough one.

173
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:39,997
Morning, Tom.

174
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,086
Morning, Dave.

175
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,509
How are you?

176
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,816
Need a hand?

177
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:51,848
No, thanks.
We can handle it.

178
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,251
Don't mind Tom.
You know how he is.

179
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,592
Just like
his daddy.

180
00:26:05,622 --> 00:26:06,793
Look.

181
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:16,072
I hate being
a farmer's wife.

182
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:19,068
Your attention,
please.

183
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:21,636
The next item
for auction

184
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:25,311
is the John Deere model
7000 four-row corn planter.

185
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:28,246
It's owned by
the Garveys.

186
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,712
What am I bid?

187
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:33,383
Who started the bidding?

188
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:36,019
Who'll give me a six?

189
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,419
A $5,000 bid.

190
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:40,924
Anybody got five?
Anybody got four, four?

191
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:44,530
$500.

192
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,742
Gentlemen, we have a $6,000
piece of farm machinery here.

193
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:55,516
We only have $500
bid on it.

194
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:01,411
We got $500,
now six, six, go seven.

195
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,944
$50!

196
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,915
I got $550, now $600.

197
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,349
Six-and-a-half?

198
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,053
$700! Who'll go seven?

199
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,152
Eight!

200
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:13,339
Eight, eight, nine?

201
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,492
Bid ten, ten, ten?

202
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:16,825
$1, 100.

203
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,827
Bid 11 and a quarter?

204
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:22,664
Who'll bid 11
and a quarter?

205
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:26,044
I sold an $1, 100 bid.
Number 13.

206
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,062
I'm sorry, son.

207
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:35,750
That's all right.

208
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:41,551
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

209
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,520
Could I have
your attention, please?

210
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:46,491
Move on down.
Form a circle.

211
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,428
We're going to have
an auction.

212
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:54,838
You people in the rear
come over on this side.

213
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:58,900
You people,
come on around.

214
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,642
Farmers, come in.
We're having an auction.

215
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:07,884
I'd like to present to you
Dan Gaumer and his family.

216
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,857
The merchandise we're selling
this afternoon belongs to them.

217
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:17,187
We're going to be selling the
personal property, farm equipment,

218
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,421
machinery,
and livestock.

219
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:22,092
If you want to know anything
about this equipment,

220
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:25,695
livestock, machinery,
step up and ask Dan.

221
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,107
He's worked it,
he knows it.

222
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,635
You all just ask him.

223
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,939
Everything is to be sold.

224
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:37,982
They're going to
sell his farm.

225
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,343
He's five miles
down the river.

226
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:42,379
His land must
be gone, too.

227
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:43,645
Looks that way.

228
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,750
The first item
we'll be selling...

229
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:49,287
We won't stand
for this shit!

230
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,488
You ain't
selling him out.

231
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,057
You tell him!

232
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,591
No sale, no sale!

233
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,894
Hold on just a minute, please.

234
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,161
No sale!

235
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,938
I agree with Smoot.
No sale.

236
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,269
We're conducting
a professional auction.

237
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:07,638
No sale!
Hold on just a minute.

238
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:08,972
Are we gonna
let him sell?

239
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:10,280
Stop this sale!

240
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,440
No sale!

241
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:15,098
Ain't gonna be
no farm selling.

242
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,721
No sale!
No sale! No sale!

243
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:42,639
Hold it, everybody.
Hold it!

244
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:47,444
Everybody hold it!
Please!

245
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:52,322
Hold it,
everybody, please!

246
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,392
Will you listen
to me, please?

247
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:57,756
It's too late.

248
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:02,101
They already took it.

249
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,635
Do you understand?

250
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:08,107
My farm's gone.

251
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,400
They already
foreclosed on me.

252
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,566
See there?

253
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,302
We aren't selling
his farm.

254
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:18,374
We're just selling property,
machinery and livestock.

255
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,649
So just move back.

256
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:24,756
Earl, Charlie, everybody, I
appreciate what you're doing.

257
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:28,659
I really do and
I understand,

258
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,590
but my place
is already gone.

259
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,363
This stuff here is
all that's left.

260
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:46,940
We'll need the money
to clear on out.

261
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,341
I just want to
thank you.

262
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:54,544
God bless you.

263
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:01,962
Mr. Richardson,
just go on.

264
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,822
Thank you, Dan. The
first item to be auctioned

265
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:09,667
will be the Farmall
model 100 tractor.

266
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:12,873
Who'll make
a $2,000 bid?

267
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,553
Billy, where are
you going?

268
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:55,150
To tell Lewis
good-bye.

269
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:56,713
Don't take
too long.

270
00:31:58,174 --> 00:32:00,810
My dad says they got
Little League in the city.

271
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,846
Uniforms and
everything.

272
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,468
That's great.

273
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:07,658
Billy,
Billy!

274
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:12,523
Billy, Daddy says
we got to hurry.

275
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:19,671
Bye, Lewis.

276
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,311
Got to go.

277
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:12,455
They're all here.
You ready?

278
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:14,628
Yeah, let's go.

279
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:17,720
Okay, everybody
listen up!

280
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:19,199
Who's first?

281
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:20,757
Garvey!

282
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:27,063
Say, Tom, did you get
the water off your land?

283
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,507
It's going.

284
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,378
Why didn't you
answer my letter?

285
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,445
Didn't know I had to.

286
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,739
You want to contract?

287
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:37,906
Yep.

288
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,842
Another crop, huh?

289
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,377
It's a habit.

290
00:33:41,577 --> 00:33:44,614
Three hundred twenty acres?
How many bushels?

291
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,920
Hundred and thirty
an acre.

292
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:48,720
That many, huh?

293
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,256
That's $3.45.

294
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:58,463
$3.45?

295
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:00,528
It says $3.50 there.

296
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:03,366
Them's morning prices.
It's gone down.

297
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:05,466
Who sets the prices?

298
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,337
The free market.
I thought it was you.

299
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,476
You set everything else.

300
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:13,186
You don't like the price,
haul your crop to the city.

301
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:15,679
You've got options,
Tom.

302
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,025
Well, I need the seed.

303
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:23,521
I haven't got the cash,
so I don't have any options.

304
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,187
Load him up.

305
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:28,065
Load him up!
Garvey!

306
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,129
Next, Youngdall.

307
00:34:33,164 --> 00:34:34,595
Here.

308
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,915
How many acres?

309
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,108
Hundred and twenty.

310
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,325
How many bushels?

311
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,507
Hundred and ten.

312
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:47,179
Mama, she don't
look too good.

313
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,346
Don't worry, honey. This
medicine will make her better.

314
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,065
It's real strong.

315
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,750
Hear that, Jessica?

316
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:55,249
You just rest.

317
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:57,764
I'll come see you
before bedtime.

318
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:06,932
Keep it steady.

319
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,506
Keep them feathers
just off the cutting edge.

320
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,843
Don't be afraid of it.

321
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:22,151
Go ahead.

322
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,248
I'm going to take a nap.

323
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:31,522
Dad, don't go to sleep.
Maybe you better do it.

324
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:34,323
You're doing fine.

325
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:35,767
Go on.

326
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,979
Hi, Eldridge.

327
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,513
That's not fair, Joe.

328
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:00,049
I got Gaumer
to sell out.

329
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,649
One out of eight.

330
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:05,121
Tessley has a big payment he can't meet.

331
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:07,388
Youngdall's
ready to fold.

332
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,658
You could've
bankrupted Garvey.

333
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,894
Instead, you rolled
his notes over.

334
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:14,662
He's a good
customer, Joe.

335
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:17,734
Haven't I been
a good customer?

336
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:21,375
I'd hate to
change banks.

337
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,977
No, sir, Joe,

338
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:30,344
I wouldn't want you
to do that.

339
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:33,587
Then you start squeezing
like you said you would.

340
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:38,060
Thanks for coming by,
Howard.

341
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,273
Are those Oreos?

342
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:57,276
Yes.

343
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:03,523
You got pretty hair,
just like your mama's.

344
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,012
Thank you.

345
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,287
Look at that face.

346
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:09,295
Let's get rid of
that mustache.

347
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,659
Turn your head.

348
00:37:13,156 --> 00:37:19,903
You know, Oreos are just about my
favorite cookie in the whole world.

349
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:22,943
Yours, too?

350
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:26,234
Mama said
don't talk to strangers.

351
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,773
Your mama's right,
but I'm no stranger.

352
00:37:29,939 --> 00:37:32,851
There's no answer, Beth.
I guess we'll have to wait.

353
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,116
Hi, Joe.
Hello, Mae.

354
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:41,184
I was just talking your
daughter out of a cookie.

355
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,319
How'd you do?

356
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,420
No luck yet.

357
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:47,190
If you're stuck,
I can give you a lift.

358
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:50,466
I'm going right by
your place.

359
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:52,160
Well...

360
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:54,834
If Tom's coming,
he'll pass us.

361
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,699
I guess it's okay.

362
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,899
Great.

363
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,268
Give me that bag.

364
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:02,505
Come on, sport.
Let's get in the Jeep.

365
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,806
How many cookies
did you eat?

366
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,512
I don't know.

367
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,090
You want a soda
or anything,

368
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:24,261
reach in that fridge
behind you.

369
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,074
Now you're corrupting
my daughter.

370
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,670
Well, if she's your
daughter, she can handle it.

371
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:39,482
We got your letter.

372
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:43,255
Tom's not interested
in selling.

373
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:47,085
How do you feel about it?

374
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:01,732
It must be hard
trying to hang on.

375
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,176
Not for Tom Garvey.

376
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,106
Thanks for the ride.

377
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:44,542
It was a pleasure.

378
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,017
Hi, Tom.

379
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,032
Thanks, sweetie.

380
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:14,970
We thought
you forgot us.

381
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,449
Sorry.

382
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,678
That roof took longer
than I thought.

383
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:21,882
What's wrong
with it?

384
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,689
Old age,
I guess.

385
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:56,081
Beth, honey,
go feed the chickens.

386
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,448
I fed them this morning.

387
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:00,859
Well,
feed them again.

388
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:03,160
Okay.

389
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:22,148
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

390
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:24,741
My favorite time of day.

391
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:47,729
Okay, try it, Dad.

392
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:08,048
Be careful,
Lewis.

393
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:17,486
Son of a bitch.

394
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,056
I just bought
this hose.

395
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:23,429
Who's desperate?

396
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:25,103
You got it.

397
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:30,200
Tom,
we needed you.

398
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:31,867
You seen Harley?

399
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,100
Around the back.

400
00:43:33,135 --> 00:43:36,372
Tom, your buddies
could have used you.

401
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:37,609
Seen Harley?

402
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:38,812
He's down there.

403
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,380
Excuse me, Dave.

404
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:44,182
Tom.

405
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:46,947
Harley,
I need a new hose.

406
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:49,218
Look at this thing
you gave me.

407
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,404
It's Sunday.
I ain't open.

408
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,556
I'm not asking you
to open.

409
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,923
Just get me a new one.

410
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:59,426
No way I'm opening
on Sunday.

411
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:01,997
I'm a Christian. There's
just no way I'm opening.

412
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:06,602
If I don't have
a hose in five minutes,

413
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:08,875
you'll have
a Christian burial.

414
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,113
Got your attention,
didn't he?

415
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:15,420
Let's go.

416
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,723
Bye, Harley!

417
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:56,891
Nobody stocks parts on that
old hunk of junk you drive.

418
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,662
I'll sell you a new tractor.

419
00:45:01,056 --> 00:45:03,160
Just get the hose, Harley.

420
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:09,070
Harley, as long as you're
open, I'll pump myself some gas.

421
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:10,766
Got the keys?

422
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:13,645
Thank you.

423
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:18,417
"Just get the hose,
Harley. "

424
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,421
Nice machine, huh?

425
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:33,797
It's okay.

426
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,602
All right, here it is.

427
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,704
That will be $4.25.

428
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,275
Forget it.
No business on Sunday.

429
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:49,373
Thank you, Harley.

430
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:52,343
You can plow and
listen to a cassette

431
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:55,049
while the air conditioner
keeps you cool.

432
00:45:57,312 --> 00:45:58,313
Hey, Lewis.

433
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:09,435
Why don't you
play ball anymore?

434
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:11,592
Haven't got time.

435
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,861
There's a game next Sunday.

436
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,366
Nobody in the valley
can touch my fastball.

437
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:28,378
Hit a homer!

438
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:31,120
Hit a homer, Daddy!

439
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:40,254
Ball one.

440
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:42,701
Foul! You cheater!

441
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:48,599
Come on, Harve.

442
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:52,473
Do it again, Joe!

443
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:08,083
Ball two!

444
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:15,094
I'll talk to him.

445
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:17,935
No, I'll talk to him.

446
00:47:26,201 --> 00:47:27,975
Go get him, Dad!

447
00:47:32,941 --> 00:47:35,577
You having a little
control problem?

448
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:37,112
I guess so.

449
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,214
Get a hold on yourself.

450
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:43,320
Try putting one there
and see what happens.

451
00:47:45,187 --> 00:47:46,859
Let's play ball.

452
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,460
Way to tell him, Dad!

453
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:52,870
All right!

454
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:18,659
Come on, Tom!

455
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:22,491
Bring it home!

456
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:31,300
You're out!

457
00:48:57,192 --> 00:49:00,172
Mom!

458
00:49:01,263 --> 00:49:03,640
Daddy hit a homer!

459
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,014
It stinks in here.

460
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,451
Mom's not home.

461
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:08,269
Is Jessica dead?

462
00:50:10,098 --> 00:50:11,542
Yes, she is.

463
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:18,376
I'm sorry, Beth.

464
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,949
I tried.

465
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:26,752
I should have called the vet,
but we owe him so much.

466
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:30,219
I just couldn't face him.

467
00:50:32,254 --> 00:50:33,664
I'm sorry.

468
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:45,475
Lewis, take her
into the house.

469
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,121
Wait. I have to say
good-bye to her.

470
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,435
I don't know
what to do about Sears.

471
00:51:19,801 --> 00:51:21,473
I sold the quilt.

472
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,916
I paid the FHA.

473
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:29,015
Power company sent
a final notice.

474
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,389
I've got a money order
for that.

475
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:35,350
I found an old pair
of Lewis' sneakers.

476
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:37,454
I can give those to Beth.

477
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:42,631
But I don't know
what to do about Sears.

478
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,533
Corn will be ready to
pick in about 90 days.

479
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:57,173
Can you hold on
till then?

480
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:04,012
I don't know. We got
nothing else to sell

481
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:07,683
but the land.

482
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:28,707
Spring. You'd think
it would warm up.

483
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:31,273
The city gets
colder every year.

484
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:32,581
Bitter.

485
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,582
You noticed my marriage
ain't so good, huh?

486
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:42,651
Now I'm working, maybe
things will get better.

487
00:52:42,686 --> 00:52:44,824
Swick, there's
the guy, Swick.

488
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,456
He's the boss.
Take your hat off.

489
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:49,865
Next two.

490
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,927
What do
you say?

491
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,297
Shut up!

492
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,005
How's it going?

493
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,470
How's your sister?

494
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:05,712
Oh, she's fine,
just fine.

495
00:53:06,108 --> 00:53:08,877
This is the fellow
I mentioned.

496
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:09,910
Hi.

497
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:11,484
Hi. How are you?

498
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,023
He needs the work.

499
00:53:15,851 --> 00:53:17,694
What can you handle?

500
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:20,129
Oh, whatever you got.

501
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:23,376
Cut and weld,
both oxy and arc.

502
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,998
I can do layout.
I can braze.

503
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:28,836
He's my cousin,
and he's good.

504
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,642
All right. He's on.

505
00:53:36,138 --> 00:53:38,515
But you fucking
better be good.

506
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:42,144
You get $4.50 an hour, 50-hour week.

507
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:43,979
You get a flop.

508
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:45,287
Shut up!

509
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:48,383
Get him
on the truck.

510
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:49,918
Appreciate it.

511
00:53:50,552 --> 00:53:52,219
What's a flop?

512
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:54,700
It's an on-site job.
Didn't I tell you?

513
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,410
It's all shut down.
It's all gone to hell.

514
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,367
Stay away from the edge!

515
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,411
What is this?

516
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,822
It's a strike.
We're scabs.

517
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,595
Okay, boys,
party's over.

518
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,130
Everybody off.

519
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:17,843
Come on.
Get off there.

520
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,474
Come on.

521
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,280
Come on, boys.

522
00:56:24,105 --> 00:56:25,982
Let's go. Keep moving.

523
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,978
Watch where
you're going, you asshole!

524
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:31,344
We're taking their jobs.

525
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:33,483
It's the only jobs
there are.

526
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:49,229
Everybody, listen up!

527
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:51,505
I'm going to say this once.

528
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:55,912
Now, the tool shed
is down there.

529
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,613
You get number tags.
Don't lose them.

530
00:57:00,475 --> 00:57:03,217
If you break a tool,
you pay for it.

531
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:07,284
You ruin the work,
you pay for it.

532
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,591
You get a piss break
every two hours.

533
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,354
We'll give you a cot.

534
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,869
You eat what's in the canteen.

535
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:20,195
No booze and no dope.

536
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:22,796
Anybody that wants to
leave here,

537
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:27,473
you're crossing that picket
line on your fucking own.

538
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,910
Got it?

539
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:32,651
Good. Let's go, boys.

540
00:57:33,508 --> 00:57:36,488
Move it out!
You look like girls.

541
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:15,483
Make sure the cut
is real clean, okay?

542
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:17,552
If not, it's my ass.

543
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:19,587
Your ass, too, Jim.

544
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:20,653
Tom.

545
00:58:20,688 --> 00:58:22,292
Nice meeting you, Jim.

546
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,542
What are
we making?

547
00:58:24,577 --> 00:58:26,426
I don't know, pipes.

548
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,838
Boilers for ships.
Power plants.

549
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,500
Sewers to
wash away shit.

550
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,004
It's work.
Get to it.

551
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:05,204
Go like that
and squeeze.

552
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:16,278
Get it up and
slide down.

553
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:20,850
Go up, slide down,
and then squeeze.

554
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:29,956
Good!

555
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:31,401
Thank you.

556
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:02,824
Lewis.

557
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:11,632
Earth that gave us this food,
sun that made it ripe and good,

558
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:16,104
dearest earth, dearest sun, we'll
not forget what you have done.

559
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:18,083
Amen. Beth.

560
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:44,959
Come on, Beth.

561
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:51,802
Mommy!

562
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:53,207
What?

563
01:02:02,877 --> 01:02:04,412
Come on, Beth.

564
01:03:52,587 --> 01:03:54,122
Oh, damn.

565
01:04:58,553 --> 01:04:59,997
Mrs. Garvey!

566
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,986
Help me!

567
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:25,551
Here!

568
01:05:26,414 --> 01:05:27,756
Help me!

569
01:05:41,529 --> 01:05:42,973
Mrs. Garvey.

570
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:05,953
Bram.

571
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:10,356
Move this thing.

572
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,497
Help me move it.

573
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:21,807
Move this.

574
01:07:27,268 --> 01:07:29,179
Move this thing, Bram.

575
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:36,048
I'm going to have
to get Judy.

576
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,955
Damn it!

577
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:43,057
Hit it!

578
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:52,499
Hit me!

579
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:01,738
Hit me, Bram.

580
01:09:15,376 --> 01:09:17,048
Be home, Judy.

581
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,081
Let Tom do the cooking.

582
01:09:54,116 --> 01:09:55,850
Keep off your feet.

583
01:09:55,885 --> 01:09:57,585
These should help.

584
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,155
I'll be okay.

585
01:10:00,054 --> 01:10:01,555
Thanks, Tom.

586
01:10:15,536 --> 01:10:17,777
Easy.
Take it easy.

587
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,014
Don't.

588
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:56,242
I'm saying it.

589
01:10:56,277 --> 01:10:57,881
I don't want to
hear it.

590
01:10:58,646 --> 01:11:02,116
I can't stop
thinking about you.

591
01:11:02,683 --> 01:11:04,083
I try.

592
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:06,495
I try, but
I can't help myself.

593
01:11:09,089 --> 01:11:10,659
It's too late.

594
01:11:12,493 --> 01:11:14,165
You chose Emily.

595
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:17,364
I chose Tom.

596
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:21,902
It's too late.

597
01:11:28,108 --> 01:11:30,281
Lives can change.

598
01:11:30,778 --> 01:11:34,316
Lives can change.
I can make them change easy.

599
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:41,058
This kind of life is
over. Can't you see that?

600
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:49,340
Old Man Leutz isn't going
to be around forever.

601
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:55,038
Think about what that
could mean to your kids.

602
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:02,079
Life doesn't have
to be so hard.

603
01:12:06,747 --> 01:12:08,521
That's my kids.

604
01:12:09,984 --> 01:12:11,485
Go home, Joe.

605
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:13,491
Please, go home.

606
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:10,843
Did you get her?

607
01:13:10,878 --> 01:13:13,620
Yeah. I just
talked to her.

608
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:16,124
She don't
sound good.

609
01:13:17,618 --> 01:13:19,427
This your first one?

610
01:13:22,256 --> 01:13:23,427
Yeah.

611
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,468
What month is she in?

612
01:13:27,127 --> 01:13:28,401
Seventh.

613
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:33,707
I don't like her
working the farm alone.

614
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:36,001
Don't worry, kid.

615
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,437
It'll go
smooth as silk.

616
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:41,775
Can we get music
out of this?

617
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,277
Don't touch that.

618
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:45,314
I need the weather.

619
01:13:45,349 --> 01:13:47,316
You going on a picnic?

620
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:50,551
No. He's a farmer.

621
01:13:51,985 --> 01:13:53,692
Working in
this shithole,

622
01:13:53,727 --> 01:13:55,399
he can't be
doing so good.

623
01:13:58,192 --> 01:14:00,562
It smells like
something

624
01:14:00,597 --> 01:14:02,933
crawled up in you
and died!

625
01:14:03,464 --> 01:14:05,332
Maybe it's your mama.

626
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,436
I need some air.

627
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,643
Hey, farmer, you into air, ain't you?

628
01:14:11,805 --> 01:14:13,477
Come on, Baines.

629
01:14:43,837 --> 01:14:45,742
How come
you grow all that food

630
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:47,648
and people
are still hungry?

631
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:53,114
I don't know. There's
something wrong somewhere.

632
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,954
You're a farmer,
ain't you?

633
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,524
I got no answers.

634
01:14:59,353 --> 01:15:01,162
I don't get it, Jim.

635
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:06,860
Look at this!

636
01:15:08,028 --> 01:15:09,129
How much
you weigh, Jim?

637
01:15:09,164 --> 01:15:10,229
I don't know.

638
01:15:10,264 --> 01:15:12,505
Hundred and
sixty-five, 170.

639
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:16,603
What about you?
How much you weigh?

640
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:17,791
Hundred and sixty.

641
01:15:17,826 --> 01:15:18,944
Hundred and sixty?

642
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:26,022
You mothers are staring at 205
pounds of USDA prime nigger.

643
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,224
How about you, kid?

644
01:15:32,052 --> 01:15:33,826
How much you weigh?

645
01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:36,890
I don't know.

646
01:15:42,129 --> 01:15:44,006
Hey. Where you going?

647
01:15:44,298 --> 01:15:45,936
I'm going home.

648
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,435
Dumb bastard.

649
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,287
Get back here.

650
01:15:50,322 --> 01:15:51,370
Hey! Wait!

651
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:53,248
Get back over here!

652
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:56,717
Scab son of a bitch!

653
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,315
Get him, Rick!

654
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,035
Stinking scab!

655
01:16:21,435 --> 01:16:22,914
Take my job!

656
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,229
I'll kill you!

657
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:29,619
Take my job!

658
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,543
Roy, come on.

659
01:16:31,578 --> 01:16:33,523
Let's get out of here.

660
01:16:34,748 --> 01:16:36,318
I'll kill you!

661
01:16:50,998 --> 01:16:52,966
Don't, Truck!

662
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:54,900
Stop! Stop it!

663
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:56,703
Stop!
You'll kill him!

664
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:57,874
Stop!

665
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,081
Let's go.

666
01:17:02,876 --> 01:17:04,312
Come on, mothers!

667
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:05,749
Get up! Come on.

668
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:27,621
You okay?

669
01:17:27,656 --> 01:17:29,109
Terrific.

670
01:17:33,073 --> 01:17:35,052
Crazy frigging farmers.

671
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:38,185
You all right, kid?

672
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:40,250
Yeah.

673
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,189
Thanks.

674
01:17:45,385 --> 01:17:46,920
Chickenshits.

675
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:17,584
Mommy, Daddy's
on the telephone!

676
01:18:17,619 --> 01:18:19,004
Mommy!

677
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:20,390
What?

678
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:23,330
Daddy's on the phone!

679
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:47,350
Tom?

680
01:18:47,981 --> 01:18:49,323
Yes.

681
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:50,784
How is he?
We are.

682
01:18:50,819 --> 01:18:53,971
How is he?

683
01:18:54,006 --> 01:18:57,089
He's fine.

684
01:18:57,124 --> 01:18:59,958
I got it into my head

685
01:18:59,993 --> 01:19:02,996
that maybe you and the kids
could come up here next weekend.

686
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,442
I'll send
the bus tickets to you.

687
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:08,667
Mom, what is it?

688
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,571
We're going to the city
to see your dad.

689
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,147
All right, everybody,
listen up.

690
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:26,289
You meet this truck
Sunday at midnight.

691
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:30,260
Now, if you don't show,
you don't get back in.

692
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,394
Take them out
through the dump.

693
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,396
Poachers.

694
01:20:01,688 --> 01:20:05,101
They've been in there all
summer. Everybody's hungry.

695
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:06,596
Look.

696
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,406
Whitetail are getting
pushed out.

697
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,411
When's hunting
season start?

698
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,213
Two adults.

699
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:25,113
Four adults and two...
Five adults and one child.

700
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:33,629
Two adults.

701
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:43,895
Lewis.

702
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,665
Me and Roy's going deer
hunting in two weeks.

703
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,101
We'd like you
to come.

704
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:49,236
I can? Really?

705
01:20:49,271 --> 01:20:50,680
Yeah.

706
01:20:50,904 --> 01:20:52,237
I said yes.

707
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:53,605
Beth, did you hear?

708
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,017
Dad and Roy's
taking me hunting.

709
01:20:58,945 --> 01:21:00,116
Mae.

710
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,291
After the show, the kids
can stay with Ida and Roy.

711
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,113
I'm sorry.

712
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:27,149
I can't.

713
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,414
Maybe I want you
too bad.

714
01:21:35,048 --> 01:21:36,492
I know.

715
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:38,227
Me, too.

716
01:22:00,106 --> 01:22:02,415
The snore
that ate Birmingham.

717
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,313
You should hear the barracks
at 3:00 in the morning.

718
01:22:06,348 --> 01:22:08,452
Sounds like
a damn sawmill.

719
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,498
The crops okay?

720
01:22:22,863 --> 01:22:24,433
They're fine.

721
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,976
Can you do all of it?

722
01:22:31,271 --> 01:22:32,715
I can handle it.

723
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:35,542
Nothing wrong?

724
01:22:36,176 --> 01:22:37,382
No.

725
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,386
Wade been around?

726
01:22:44,885 --> 01:22:45,988
No.

727
01:22:52,893 --> 01:22:55,498
You don't always
tell me everything.

728
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,310
You want me to
make something up?

729
01:23:01,968 --> 01:23:04,277
We've got weevils
in the corn.

730
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:12,021
You don't always
tell me everything either.

731
01:23:21,655 --> 01:23:23,600
The plant is

732
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,464
noisy.

733
01:23:27,499 --> 01:23:28,770
The noise.

734
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:33,974
It's hot.

735
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,513
It's hard to breathe.

736
01:23:44,577 --> 01:23:47,455
When I go out for air,
I see the strikers.

737
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:56,828
Even when you can't see them,
you know that they're there.

738
01:24:01,194 --> 01:24:02,934
I can't sleep.

739
01:24:04,764 --> 01:24:07,210
If you sleep, you dream.

740
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:15,110
I dreamt about the river
last night.

741
01:24:18,778 --> 01:24:21,224
Only it wasn't a river.

742
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,595
It was a big snake.

743
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,268
I couldn't find the head
or the tail of it.

744
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:38,439
It had me wrapped up so tight
I just couldn't breathe.

745
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:49,952
What's this?

746
01:24:52,645 --> 01:24:54,454
The machinery's hot.

747
01:25:00,954 --> 01:25:02,296
And this?

748
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:07,597
People aren't so neighborly
in there.

749
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:17,374
I know what this is.
I gave it to you.

750
01:25:20,774 --> 01:25:23,143
Some nights
I miss you so bad.

751
01:25:23,178 --> 01:25:25,088
I ache for you so bad.

752
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:19,342
Look at that deer.

753
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:34,985
Hey! Look at that!

754
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:38,994
It's a deer.

755
01:26:41,454 --> 01:26:42,754
What the hell?

756
01:26:42,789 --> 01:26:44,893
Hey.
It's a goddamn deer.

757
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,116
Barbecue!

758
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,248
Get him in!

759
01:27:10,283 --> 01:27:11,420
Lock it up!

760
01:29:21,614 --> 01:29:24,094
All right.
Everybody, listen.

761
01:29:24,684 --> 01:29:26,651
Pick up your money
at the window.

762
01:29:26,686 --> 01:29:30,998
I want you all out of here
in one hour.

763
01:29:31,724 --> 01:29:33,965
The strike is over.

764
01:29:34,761 --> 01:29:36,327
It's settled.

765
01:29:36,362 --> 01:29:38,171
The strike is over.

766
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:41,432
All right. Move it out.

767
01:29:41,467 --> 01:29:43,844
Come on, boys.
The party's over.

768
01:29:44,304 --> 01:29:47,407
Keep moving.
Keep walking.

769
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:50,285
Come on. Speed it up.

770
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:55,131
Come on.
Don't start bunching up.

771
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:58,651
Damn it, didn't you hear me? Move!

772
01:29:58,686 --> 01:30:00,186
Where are the trucks?

773
01:30:01,487 --> 01:30:03,227
There's no trucks.

774
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:10,439
As part of their deal, you've
got to walk out of here.

775
01:30:11,798 --> 01:30:14,574
Damn it.
I said there's no trucks.

776
01:30:15,234 --> 01:30:19,204
You heard me. There's no
trucks. It's part of their deal.

777
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:21,773
You no-good pimp!

778
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:23,753
You've got to walk out.

779
01:30:39,459 --> 01:30:40,938
Open the gate!

780
01:32:39,278 --> 01:32:41,655
Goddamn scabs,
get out of here.

781
01:32:42,248 --> 01:32:43,590
Scabs!

782
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,260
Go home, scabs!

783
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:54,295
Go home where you belong!

784
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:55,798
Get out of here.

785
01:33:00,733 --> 01:33:03,236
You dirty scabs!
Go home!

786
01:33:04,737 --> 01:33:07,717
Go home, scabs!
Go home!

787
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,162
You scum.

788
01:34:00,326 --> 01:34:01,359
Dad!

789
01:34:01,394 --> 01:34:03,999
Mom! Beth! Dad's home!

790
01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:10,911
Hey, boy!

791
01:34:12,538 --> 01:34:13,812
Dad!

792
01:34:20,012 --> 01:34:21,131
Look at this.

793
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:22,251
Come and see.

794
01:34:38,731 --> 01:34:40,574
That's a good crop.

795
01:34:41,534 --> 01:34:42,934
I'm proud of you.

796
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,948
All of you. Come here.

797
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:27,324
They're finished
kissing now.

798
01:35:27,913 --> 01:35:29,983
Now they're just talking.

799
01:35:31,917 --> 01:35:34,226
Daddy said
a lady spit on him.

800
01:35:36,322 --> 01:35:42,295
Are daddies allowed to cry?

801
01:35:45,765 --> 01:35:47,033
Want to sleep with me?

802
01:35:47,068 --> 01:35:48,271
Yeah.

803
01:35:48,306 --> 01:35:49,475
Lie down.

804
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:05,449
It's still pretty wet,
Tom. It ain't ready.

805
01:36:05,484 --> 01:36:07,486
What are you talking
about? It ain't ready.

806
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:09,121
Feel it.
It's dry.

807
01:36:09,156 --> 01:36:10,722
I don't want to argue.

808
01:36:11,123 --> 01:36:13,008
You should have
planted it sooner.

809
01:36:13,043 --> 01:36:14,894
The flood held us up,
but it's dry.

810
01:36:14,929 --> 01:36:16,462
Lord, I hear
fiddle music.

811
01:36:16,497 --> 01:36:18,429
We got a contract.

812
01:36:18,464 --> 01:36:21,570
If the corn's no good,
neither is the contract.

813
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:24,544
It'll cost us to dry this out.

814
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:27,006
I'll give you $2.75.

815
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:28,205
$2.75?

816
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,440
Take it or leave it.

817
01:36:29,475 --> 01:36:31,978
It cost more than that
to grow it!

818
01:36:32,378 --> 01:36:37,088
Next time you got crops to raise,
don't leave it to a pretty little thing.

819
01:36:55,234 --> 01:36:56,567
Where's Wade?

820
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:57,876
He ought to be inside.

821
01:37:04,043 --> 01:37:05,499
You seen Wade?

822
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:06,955
Where is he?

823
01:37:13,352 --> 01:37:14,708
Excuse me.

824
01:37:14,743 --> 01:37:16,064
Where's Wade?

825
01:37:16,355 --> 01:37:18,189
You must see
Mr. Stanley.

826
01:37:18,224 --> 01:37:20,658
I already have.
It's Wade's turn.

827
01:37:20,693 --> 01:37:23,799
Come with me.
We'll make an appointment.

828
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,607
You can't go in there.

829
01:37:30,836 --> 01:37:33,105
Wade, tell me
that corn's no good.

830
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,672
We're in a meeting.

831
01:37:34,707 --> 01:37:38,518
Don't send some flunky
to do me in.

832
01:37:39,111 --> 01:37:41,250
I want to hear it from you.

833
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,958
Gentlemen,
I'll be right back.

834
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,166
Okay, bonehead,
you want it, you got it.

835
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:08,985
Go on. Take a look at
the future.

836
01:38:22,822 --> 01:38:25,302
You're going to flood
the valley?

837
01:38:25,491 --> 01:38:27,061
That's right.

838
01:38:30,496 --> 01:38:33,374
My people are buried there.
So are yours.

839
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,766
I need that water.

840
01:38:35,801 --> 01:38:38,679
Everybody needs work,
and you're in the way.

841
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:42,348
What are you hanging on for? Your kids?

842
01:38:42,942 --> 01:38:44,079
Mae?

843
01:38:44,643 --> 01:38:46,713
She deserves
a lot better.

844
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,690
I don't buy it.

845
01:38:58,490 --> 01:39:02,836
And I ain't leaving
except in a box.

846
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:33,936
Mommy, will you dry my hair?

847
01:39:36,228 --> 01:39:39,129
This towel's wet.
Get me a dry one.

848
01:39:39,164 --> 01:39:41,465
Another cold front
is building.

849
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:47,177
It's spreading thunderstorms, hail
and high winds through the plains.

850
01:39:47,873 --> 01:39:50,910
This moisture,
with the already soggy ground,

851
01:39:50,945 --> 01:39:53,390
will increase local flooding.

852
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:09,336
Mom, we're going to
get rocks for the levee.

853
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,463
Wait, honey.
I'm fixing sandwiches.

854
01:40:11,498 --> 01:40:12,907
There's no time.

855
01:40:13,032 --> 01:40:16,268
Lewis, you missed lunch.

856
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:17,568
So did your father.

857
01:40:17,603 --> 01:40:20,106
Hurry.
I'll get in trouble.

858
01:40:24,209 --> 01:40:26,018
Put them under your coat!

859
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:57,616
Damn it!

860
01:41:05,951 --> 01:41:08,590
Lewis, get me
the other ratchet set.

861
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,940
Beth, come and
hold the light.

862
01:41:11,975 --> 01:41:14,335
I can't leave Alice.
She's sad.

863
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:16,696
Beth. Bring
the stool with you.

864
01:41:24,336 --> 01:41:26,372
Hold it there,
will you?

865
01:41:27,272 --> 01:41:28,639
What are you doing?

866
01:41:28,674 --> 01:41:30,913
Don't move a damn muscle, all right?

867
01:41:30,948 --> 01:41:33,153
Just hold it there.
Don't move.

868
01:41:36,115 --> 01:41:38,015
You hold it there.

869
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,086
Don't move a damn muscle.

870
01:42:14,286 --> 01:42:16,342
I need to talk
to you, Tom.

871
01:42:16,377 --> 01:42:18,398
Lewis! Wake Lewis up.

872
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,459
I need to talk to you, Tom.

873
01:42:20,494 --> 01:42:22,259
Not now. Lewis, get up!

874
01:42:22,294 --> 01:42:25,434
You're pushing him
too hard.

875
01:42:25,764 --> 01:42:28,083
He's just a kid.

876
01:42:28,118 --> 01:42:30,367
Get in the cab.

877
01:42:30,402 --> 01:42:32,036
I'm not letting you
do this.

878
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:34,173
If we don't stop the river,
it will finish us.

879
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,706
Let it end.

880
01:42:35,741 --> 01:42:38,410
Let it finish us
before you do.

881
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:40,677
I can't live like this.

882
01:42:40,712 --> 01:42:45,058
Then clear out and
go live with Joe Wade!

883
01:42:46,318 --> 01:42:47,762
Go outside.

884
01:42:53,092 --> 01:42:55,592
I don't want to
live with Joe Wade.

885
01:42:55,627 --> 01:43:00,666
I want to live with you, but
you can't hold back the river.

886
01:43:00,701 --> 01:43:02,941
Why won't you get any help?

887
01:43:03,268 --> 01:43:05,008
I don't need help.

888
01:43:05,571 --> 01:43:07,948
You don't need anybody,
do you?

889
01:43:08,273 --> 01:43:10,275
Nobody needs anybody else.

890
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:15,880
You stupid, goddamned farmer!

891
01:44:43,268 --> 01:44:46,180
Fill me a pile of them.
Make them lighter.

892
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:12,465
It's going to get worse.

893
01:45:13,298 --> 01:45:14,499
See the floodline?

894
01:45:14,534 --> 01:45:15,670
Yeah.

895
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:18,904
Hey, Mae! Mae!

896
01:45:20,772 --> 01:45:22,339
Joe Wade!

897
01:45:22,374 --> 01:45:24,148
Tom! Joe Wade!

898
01:45:31,683 --> 01:45:33,485
They ain't
going to make it.

899
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,897
Well, they might.

900
01:45:36,421 --> 01:45:38,127
They just might.

901
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:09,425
Come on over here
a minute! Listen up!

902
01:46:09,888 --> 01:46:12,027
Come on over
and listen up!

903
01:46:15,594 --> 01:46:17,733
Come on over! Listen up!

904
01:46:17,996 --> 01:46:19,634
I got some work.

905
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:22,766
Listen up here!

906
01:46:22,801 --> 01:46:25,469
I know you're cold,
wet, and hungry

907
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:28,473
and your unemployment
and welfare's run out

908
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:31,443
and you're looking
for something to happen!

909
01:46:31,478 --> 01:46:34,244
I need men
who can handle a shovel

910
01:46:34,279 --> 01:46:36,848
and aren't afraid to
work in this weather.

911
01:46:36,883 --> 01:46:40,952
Who wants to work
for $100 a day?

912
01:47:07,245 --> 01:47:08,724
It stopped.

913
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:19,991
We did it!

914
01:48:12,377 --> 01:48:15,357
Lewis, go and
get my shotgun.

915
01:49:38,897 --> 01:49:40,569
Get off my land.

916
01:49:43,635 --> 01:49:45,944
I'll give you all
one last chance!

917
01:49:46,338 --> 01:49:48,556
$10,000 more
to each of you!

918
01:49:48,591 --> 01:49:50,740
You can harvest
your crops.

919
01:49:50,775 --> 01:49:53,448
I'll give you
what we contracted for.

920
01:49:54,112 --> 01:49:56,387
But then you got to clear out.

921
01:50:14,299 --> 01:50:16,335
I want your answers now.

922
01:50:38,523 --> 01:50:40,502
Okay, boys.
Tear it down.

923
01:50:55,707 --> 01:50:56,806
Dad!

924
01:50:56,841 --> 01:50:58,109
Get off the levee!

925
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:02,849
Hold on! You don't get paid if you run.

926
01:51:05,383 --> 01:51:07,362
He won't shoot anybody.

927
01:51:20,865 --> 01:51:22,173
Get down!

928
01:51:30,008 --> 01:51:31,282
Baines?

929
01:51:35,246 --> 01:51:38,817
What the hell are you doing up
there? I damn near killed you.

930
01:51:38,852 --> 01:51:40,557
They took my farm.

931
01:51:43,221 --> 01:51:46,133
I don't want to shoot you,
but I'll do it.

932
01:51:47,392 --> 01:51:49,462
You're on the wrong side.

933
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:52,497
We've been on
the wrong side before.

934
01:51:52,532 --> 01:51:53,907
Tell them.

935
01:51:55,033 --> 01:51:57,740
What are you doing
his dirty work for?

936
01:51:58,737 --> 01:52:00,181
I'm hungry.

937
01:52:01,539 --> 01:52:03,245
We're all hungry.

938
01:52:16,221 --> 01:52:18,064
Come on,
goddamn it!

939
01:52:18,556 --> 01:52:20,729
Do what
I'm paying you for!

940
01:52:21,393 --> 01:52:23,202
Don't tear me down.

941
01:52:24,562 --> 01:52:27,542
All I got is what's
growing in these fields.

942
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:29,371
Look out!

943
01:57:12,317 --> 01:57:15,024
My God! We did it!

944
01:57:47,151 --> 01:57:50,822
Sooner or later, there's
going to be too much rain

945
01:57:50,857 --> 01:57:52,824
or too much drought

946
01:57:54,092 --> 01:57:55,627
or too much corn.

947
01:57:58,696 --> 01:58:00,140
I can wait.

948
01:59:05,129 --> 01:59:08,833
Lewis, are we going to
get rich now?

949
01:59:08,868 --> 01:59:10,299
Don't be dumb.

950
01:59:10,334 --> 01:59:12,368
Who are you calling dumb?

951
01:59:12,403 --> 01:59:16,112
I bet we get a million dollars
for this corn.

952
01:59:17,208 --> 01:59:19,661
Dad! Beth says
we're going to get

953
01:59:19,696 --> 01:59:22,114
a million dollars
for all this corn.
