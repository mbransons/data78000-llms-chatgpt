1
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,839
Hey, Wexel,
give me a hand
with these fish.

2
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,341
I don't work for y'all.

3
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,376
I'm just here to get these cans.

4
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,078
You're real useful, Wexel.

5
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,448
Thanks a lot.
I'm busy.

6
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,217
Jonsy, your breakfast is ready.

7
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,752
Okay, Grandma.

8
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,991
Wexel, let me
see those spinners.

9
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,061
Your daddy sure
makes good fishing lures.

10
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,563
We could sell those real fast.

11
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,631
Gonna cost you $6 this time.

12
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,067
Six? We've been paying five.

13
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,635
Things is going up all over.

14
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,070
Come on, eat your breakfast.

15
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,306
I don't want you
late for school again.

16
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,242
Okay, Grandma.
I just got to check
something first.

17
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,212
Grandma?

18
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,047
What, honey?

19
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,251
You suppose you
could advance me
a little more money?

20
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,686
I could work it off.

21
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,489
Sorry, you've
spent every penny
on that old wreck.

22
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,791
It's an investment, Grandma.

23
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,194
Ain't nobody gonna
pay you money
to ride that old boat.

24
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,230
Listen, Wexel, a tourist
will pay for anything.

25
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,999
I'm not going to tell you again.

26
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,334
Get in there
and get that breakfast

27
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,668
and get ready for school.

28
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,041
How are things at home?

29
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,344
Your daddy feel
any better, Wexel?

30
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,447
No, ma'am. He's talking
about sending
down to Memphis

31
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,882
so my aunt can come
and take care of him.

32
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,885
My auntie's
the meanest woman
I've ever seen.

33
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,587
She's a conjure woman.

34
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,122
And I hate Memphis.

35
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,590
Got these cousins down there

36
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,659
who want to fight
every time they see me.

37
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,595
Bye, Grandma.
You ain't had time
to eat no breakfast.

38
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,000
You come right home
after school, you hear me?

39
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,439
Hey, Wexel, if you're gonna
charge more for spinners,

40
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,441
I'm gonna charge you
for those cans.

41
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,742
A dollar a bag.

42
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,209
They don't cost you nothing.

43
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,911
Think about it.

44
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,480
Maybe we could work out a deal.

45
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,205
You come with the 300?

46
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:42,142
Listen, Poley,
I told you I won't
pay more than 250.

47
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,746
Hundred down right now.
I'll get the rest
out of Grandma.

48
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,115
You don't want to
buy that engine,
you want to steal it.

49
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,417
How'd you think you got it?

50
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,184
Now, wait just a minute!

51
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,153
That's legal
salvage, little missy.

52
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,756
I dove down that wreck
and fetched it up myself.

53
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,158
It's all beat up.
It'll have to be rebuilt.

54
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,660
New parts and everything.

55
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,496
That is a first-class engine.

56
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,732
Belonged
to some doctors
from up north.

57
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,035
And doctors don't
get nothing that
ain't first-class.

58
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,104
Come on, Poley.
Nobody wants
this thing but me.

59
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,010
$300 cash.
That's my price.

60
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,747
There's other
people wants it
that can afford it.

61
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,922
Biting out there today, Vadie?

62
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,858
Biting real good.

63
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,760
Sure hope so.

64
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,828
Y'all catch some big ones now.

65
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,334
Hi, Cal.

66
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,004
Jonsy got some
good sauce fiddlers
this morning.

67
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,673
I'll wrap you up a few.

68
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,475
Much obliged, Vadie.

69
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,112
How come you
ain't wearing your
fishing clothes, Cal?

70
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,014
You loafing or working today?

71
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,418
I got a call from
Stockman Prison, Vadie.

72
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,254
From a Dr. Cole,
about Billy.

73
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,592
Doctor?
Has he been hurt?

74
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,161
Dr. Cole runs
the rehabilitation
program up there.

75
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,798
He wants me to come
and tell you personal.

76
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,167
Billy's getting out, Vadie.

77
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,004
He's been paroled.

78
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,885
There's a lot
of paperwork you'll
have to go through.

79
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,821
Dr. Cole
will be calling you.

80
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,962
Vadie, what's the matter?

81
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,234
I don't know him anymore, Cal.

82
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,170
He wouldn't answer my letters,

83
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,205
he wouldn't let me
visit him anymore.

84
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,843
Jonsy...

85
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,612
She's never even seen him.

86
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,550
Never seen her own father.

87
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,053
Welcome home, son.

88
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,985
He killed somebody.

89
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,788
He was just a kid.

90
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,522
Tell you how he did it?

91
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,059
No. He ain't
told me nothing.

92
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,494
Just looks
through me like
I ain't even there.

93
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,640
Ain't it
a pretty evening out here?

94
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,477
How's the fish
and hush puppies, Billy?

95
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,945
Taste good, Mama.

96
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,546
I'd better make some more.

97
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,364
Guess the food in that
place is pretty bad, huh?

98
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,341
Saw this show on TV
about prisons.

99
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,945
Guys taking dope,
stabbing each other
with ice picks and stuff.

100
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,815
Know what they said they did?

101
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,884
Said they raped each other.

102
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,187
Is that true?

103
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,566
Of course, it's just television.

104
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,902
Everything on television
is a lie anyway.

105
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,044
When... When guys
rape each other,

106
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,248
what do they do exactly?

107
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,222
From now on, you come
out for the trawl line.

108
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,658
I got enough to do
getting ready for school.

109
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,426
You can still handle
a boat, can't you?

110
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,395
Yeah.
Good.

111
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,665
There's some things
you got to watch out for.

112
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,633
Like eddies and boils.

113
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,435
You know about eddies and boils?

114
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,305
An eddy's this whirlpool thing.

115
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,474
Whip you right under.

116
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,609
See that thing over there?
That's a boil.

117
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,180
Flip over a boat
like it was nothing.

118
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,916
I grew up on the river.

119
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,952
Yeah, well, I'm just
telling you stuff
in case you forgot.

120
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,242
What made that scar?

121
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,744
Knife.

122
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,415
You ever stick a knife
in anybody?

123
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,587
I'm just curious
about stuff like that.

124
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,036
You get that in prison?

125
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,539
You got people
in there give tattoos?

126
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,107
Done that myself.

127
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,946
A broken cross.

128
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,048
Real weird.

129
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,283
That mean something in prison?

130
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,456
I don't mind me
getting a tattoo sometime.

131
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,258
Look, don't touch me.

132
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,261
I don't like to get touched.

133
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,316
The one thing
I couldn't let
myself do

134
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,051
in there was remember.

135
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,220
Not you, not home...

136
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,256
Much less I had
a daughter someplace.

137
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,160
Jonsy's so much
like you were, Billy.

138
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,196
I was glad when Joyce ran away

139
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,797
and I had her to raise.

140
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,033
I couldn't let
anybody see what
I was in that place.

141
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,768
Dr. Cole said
on the phone

142
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,005
it'd take time
for you to adjust.

143
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,173
We're both trying
real hard to get you...

144
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,343
Mama, did you ever
hear from Joyce
after she run off?

145
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,613
Yes, Billy. I did.

146
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,690
Some letters came
a few years ago.

147
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,927
She'd married a man
down in Memphis.

148
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,295
They had a new family,
but they were divorced.

149
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,966
She wanted to see Jonsy.

150
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,469
She had no right
to see Jonsy
after what she did.

151
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,838
I was afraid
she'd try to take her
away from me.

152
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,641
I'd already lost you.

153
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,377
I couldn't afford
to lose her, too.

154
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,612
God forgive me,
I told her to stay away.

155
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,417
I'm tired, Mama.

156
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,023
Think I'll get some sleep.

157
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,828
Good night, son.

158
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,615
Grandma.

159
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,788
Go to sleep, honey.
It's late.

160
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,626
I don't love anybody
but you, Grandma.
All I want is you.

161
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,768
My auntie's been
all night trying
to heal Daddy.

162
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,771
Burning candles,
talking this
funny language.

163
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,143
I think I've been
kidding myself
about this boat.

164
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,845
What kind
of language?
Conjure language.

165
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,814
She threw the Doctor
out of the house

166
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,616
and put a hex on him, too.

167
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,253
Pretty soon, that doctor's
gonna need a doctor
his own self.

168
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,689
I ain't never gonna get
this thing finished
without some real help.

169
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,660
Everybody tells me
my daddy's
gonna be well...

170
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,232
But they're lying.

171
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,960
♪ Well, it's one for the money

172
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,430
♪ Two for the show
Three to get ready

173
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,898

174

182
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,757
What'd you save
that junk for?
Get rid of it.

183
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,464
These are not your things.

184
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,334
They're mine.

185
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,336
You got no right to harm them.

186
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,442
Don't you know
what you did to me

187
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,178
when you wouldn't
let me see you anymore?

188
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,482
I loved you!

189
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,487
I would have stuck
by you, no matter
what you did.

190
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,996
Nothing was more
important than us
keeping on as a family.

191
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,369
And you're still
shutting me out.

192
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,506
Me and Jonsy.

193
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,281
Customer outside, Grandma.

194
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,573
There's some real
good stuff in here.

195
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,847
Nostalgia stuff's
worth money
these days.

196
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,918
People buy anything,
long as it's old.

197
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,789
Billy...

198
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,927
Could you give me a hand
on the River Rat?

199
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,209
Billy McCain!

200
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,579
Sure never thought
I'd see you
around here again.

201
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,014
You know, I knowed
your daddy when
he was this high.

202
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,750
And Whitey, too.

203
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,985
Distributor and solenoid
ain't no account.

204
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,688
Going to have to
rebuild that generator
right there, too.

205
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,858
I couldn't
hardly believe it
when I heard

206
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,294
how much money them boys robbed.

207
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,062
How much was there?

208
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,232
Only man knows
for sure is right there.

209
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,435
Thousands and thousands
of dollars, so they said.

210
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,673
Not a dollar of it saved,
so they say.

211
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,641
What do you mean, so they say?

212
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,312
Oh, you know how these
stories get built up.

213
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,780
Some people said them boys

214
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,783
hid that money
downriver before
they got caught.

215
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,084
Like who?

216
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,387
Oh, like Whitey's mama, for one.

217
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,654
Said Whitey told her.

218
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,023
How could he
tell her anything?
He got killed.

219
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,258
Well...

220
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,364
Said his ghost
told her.
Ghost?

221
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,699
You're weird, Poley.

222
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,034
Well, I ain't saying
I believe it.

223
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,571
Educated people know
there ain't no such thing
as ghosts, probably.

224
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:43,376
But Whitey's mama swore
he came to her one night.

225
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,913
Said he come
right up to the bed
and said, "Mama,

226
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,949
"there's enough money
hid downriver

227
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,984
"to make you
a rich woman."

228
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,787
How about that, Billy?

229
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,856
They say ghosts don't lie.

230
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,292
That money got
burnt to ashes
along with Whitey.

231
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,363
And your engine
is junk.
Junk?

232
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,097
Well, there's a man
from Paducah offered me

233
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,799
$400 for that engine

234
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,535
Billy,
it ain't that bad.
I need some parts.

235
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,136
Billy, that's
a first-class engine.

236
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,305
If you knew anything
about engines...

237
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,573
I know that engine's
junk, Poley.

238
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,709
I know you're
a goddamn liar,
like you always have been.

239
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,312
Get in the truck.

240
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:22,081
Well, now, hey,
wait a minute, Billy.

241
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,783
I mean, look,
seeing as it's you,

242
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,319
I can throw in some extra parts.

243
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,521
Come on, Billy.
Let's negotiate!

244
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,725
You believe Poley
going on about ghosts?

245
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,960
Boy, he looked like a ghost

246
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,729
when you made
that move on him.
You were great.

247
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,969
Billy...

248
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,304
How did Whitey get killed?

249
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,740
Burned up
in a car wreck
with the money.

250
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,579
Tell me about the robbery.

251
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,146
I mean, I know about it
and everything,

252
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,248
but I want you to tell me
the whole story.

253
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,251
Like how you went
down the Mississippi
and all...

254
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,853
It ain't a story to me.

255
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,256
You get the toolbox
out of there.

256
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,031
Tell me about Joyce.

257
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,134
Am I like her?

258
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,269
Wasn't much older
than me when you
knocked her up.

259
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,539
Where did it happen?

260
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,508
Where did what happen?

261
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,777
Where did you do it?
Where was I,
you know, conceived?

262
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,580
In the car, I bet.
Was that it Billy,
in the back seat of a car?

263
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,582
That ain't none
of your business.

264
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,720
If it ain't my business,
it ain't nobody's.

265
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,362
That's why you
did the robbery, I bet.

266
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,566
To get the money
for an abortion.

267
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,469
They didn't have no
abortions back then.

268
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,837
Sure they did, Billy.

269
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,239
You probably just
didn't know about them,
that's all.

270
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,274
Kids today know
what their options are.

271
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,745
I just thought...

272
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,880
If she had gotten an abortion,

273
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,815
you'd be talking
to air right now.

274
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,284
Just listening to it.

275
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,354
I got to talk so much
because you never
ask me nothing.

276
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,122
Ain't you interested?

277
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,994
Well, how you like school?

278
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,396
How you like prison?

279
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,767
Ask me something else.

280
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,803
What about boyfriends?
You like boys, don't you?

281
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,539
I ain't no lezzie,
if that's what you mean.

282
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,875
Where did you learn
how to talk like that?

283
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,177
Like what?

284
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,379
Huh?

285
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,061
Hold it up against that board.

286
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,663
That's just right.

287
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,265
Now we'll see what happens.

288
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,936
A straight line.

289
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,407
Hey, y'all, come eat
your sandwiches.

290
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,177
We'll leave that
in there about
30 seconds, that's all.

291
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,219
Pull it out.

292
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:48,955
Mighty fine.

293
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,292
Two little taps is all it takes.

294
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,095
Perfect.

295
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,447
Ah...
Be careful.

296
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,721
Don't want to have to
paint that thing twice.

297
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,658
Good.

298
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,959
Real good.

299
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,378
Whoo!

300
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,636
Hey, Poley.
How you like her?

301
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,537
Engine runs good, huh?

302
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,506
Didn't have
to rebuild that
generator after all.

303
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,111
Wish we could keep going.

304
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,347
Take a real shakedown cruise.

305
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,050
Why can't we?
Take it down
to Memphis, maybe.

306
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,317
It ain't that far.

307
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,654
That'd be great.

308
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,989
Sheriff Wade says
you can't leave
the county.

309
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,424
It ain't up to no
Sheriff Calvin Wade.

310
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,295
That's right, Dr. Cole.

311
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,965
Memphis is just
a few hours away
on the river.

312
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,534
It amounts to
a little overnight
camping trip.

313
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,136
I talked it over
with Billy's mother.

314
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,307
We both feel the more time
he has with his daughter,
the better.

315
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,276
Is he going
to let us go?
Don't know.

316
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,612
Thank you, Dr. Cole.

317
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,986
Dr. Cole says
you can go.

318
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,761
Hey, Billy.

319
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,798
You know what
we ought to do
when we get to Memphis?

320
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,966
Go see Elvis's house.

321
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,601
They say it's fantastic.

322
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,570
All his clothes
are in the closets
and everything.

323
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,973
Listen here, Jonsy.
Too bad how
he ended up though.

324
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,241
Sad.

325
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,043
It ain't good
to count on things
too much.

326
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,244
That's the truth.

327
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,779
There he was.
He had everything
in the world.

328
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,949
Then look what happened.
I ain't talking
about Elvis.

329
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,419
You mean nobody
can never count
on nothing?

330
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,655
I already know that.

331
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,858
I guess you do.

332
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,999
Wexel,
Billy and I are having
a private conversation.

333
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,735
What do you want, anyway?

334
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,103
My daddy... He died.

335
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,847
We're closed.

336
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,684
Billy, it's Dr. Cole.

337
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,530
Hello, Billy.

338
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,565
Doc.

339
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,467
What are you doing here?

340
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,469
This place is just
like you described it.

341
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:00,572
Lovely and peaceful.

342
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,845
Is that the boat
you been working on
with your daughter?

343
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,114
Boy, that's very impressive.

344
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,949
Of course, I don't know
a thing about boats.

345
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,184
Where is your family?

346
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,552
They went to a funeral.

347
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,323
What do you want?

348
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,663
Something's happened, Billy.

349
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:25,965
Up at the prison.

350
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,768
It's going to mean
a change in our plans.

351
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:31,103
We got to talk.

352
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,775
We ain't talking here.

353
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,477
You get in that skiff
right there.

354
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,296
I'm going to check
the River Rat.

355
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,398
You change out of your
good clothes first.

356
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,636
Who's that with Billy?

357
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,941
Fishing customer, probably.

358
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,705
Want to go back there?

359
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,607
I can take you back to Stockman

360
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,842
and put your ass
right back in there.

361
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,512
Doc, I need more time!

362
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,247
I got no time!

363
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,383
What's that noise?

364
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,785
No, Billy!
Billy, I can't swim!
No, Billy!

365
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,095
Wexel!

366
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,932
Wexel, answer me,
you little Satan!

367
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,867
Wexel, where are you?

368
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,404
That bus is leaving
for Memphis tomorrow.

369
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,173
And we're gonna be on it.

370
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,275
Wexel!

371
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,578
You come back here!

372
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,980
Wexel!

373
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,083
Wexel!

374
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,651
Come back here!

375
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,327
There's a storm front
moving in off the coast.

376
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,996
We can expect thundershowers

377
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:40,166
and a slight drop
in temperature
for a couple days.

378
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,234
But until then, there'll
be plenty of sunshine,

379
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,803
and the mercury
will stay in the 90s.

380
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,743
Help me.

381
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,012
Please help.

382
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:01,213
Help. Help.

383
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,387
Hey!
Where are you going?

384
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,491
You steal something?

385
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,245
Help me.

386
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,481
Please help me.

387
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,983
Yes, sir.
That's what
I'm trying to do.

388
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,252
If you let go of my arm,

389
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,322
I'll go fetch you
a doctor.
No. No doctor.

390
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,824
No doctor. Help me.

391
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,559
Please help me. I'll...

392
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,129
I'll pay you.

393
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,231
I'll pay you.

394
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,042
We're doing it.

395
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,745
I can't believe,
but we're finally doing it.

396
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,115
Okay if I take the wheel?

397
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,684
Morning.

398
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,952
How you doing?

399
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,790
You feeling
all right this morning?

400
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,729
Beck is the name.
Poley Beck.

401
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,667
You have you an accident
on the river?

402
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,403
Yeah, an accident.
My boat went down.

403
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:12,938
Oh, where'd she sink?

404
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,140
Might be I could
salvage her for you.

405
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,108
Charge you a fair price.

406
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,177
Anybody else
on board?
No.

407
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,747
So you're a doctor, huh?

408
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,450
Oh. Well...

409
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,352
I saw your I.D.
In your billfold

410
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,153
when I was, uh, checking.

411
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,623
Saw you work at Stockman Prison.

412
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,392
You know McCain's boat dock?

413
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,826
Sure do.

414
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,128
You here
to see Billy
on prison business?

415
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,201
Wexel, what the hell
are you doing in there?

416
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,670
How'd he get here?
He hid out.
That's what he's done.

417
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,706
Doggone you, Wexel.
You ain't getting away
with this.

418
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,608
I'm turning this boat
around right now.

419
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,110
No, I ain't
going back. I'm scared.

420
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,912
He's got this aunt
he's scared of.

421
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,114
It ain't her.
I've seen something.

422
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,482
A man.
He tried to get me.

423
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,984
We turn back, we'll lose
half a day, damn it.

424
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,721
He come out of the bog
by that flashing light.

425
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,122
He come after me.

426
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,024
This beats anything I ever saw.

427
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,626
You ain't going to
horn in on this trip, Wexel.

428
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,160
You're going home.

429
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,129
Get up here and sit down, boy.

430
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,233
What man?
What did he look like?

431
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,635
This big man wearing white.

432
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,037
You're lying to me, boy.
You ain't seen no man.

433
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,373
I seen him.
I seen him.
I swear I did.

434
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,310
He must have seen something
to be that scared.

435
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:00,646
Take it easy, Wexel.
It's okay.

436
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,748
That Mr. Poley
was there, too.

437
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,684
I was scared of the man.
And I had no place
else to go.

438
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,952
We got to take him back.

439
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,754
People will be
worried about him.

440
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,089
We ain't going back.
We're going to Memphis.

441
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,559
You got kinfolks there,
ain't you, Wexel?

442
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,861
My cousins.
I hate them, too.

443
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:19,264
Tough. When we get there,
you're going to call them
to come and get you.

444
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,368
We're not going to be
saddled with you
both legs of this trip.

445
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,743
Something I can
do for you, Poley?

446
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,680
Uh, yes, ma'am.
The Doctor asked me
to pick up his car.

447
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,949
What doctor?
What car?

448
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:14,486
Well, he said he left it
here yesterday evening
when he put his boat out.

449
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,788
That's an empty
driveway out there, Poley.

450
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:19,591
There ain't
been no doctor
with no boat.

451
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,894
Billy took a man out
in the skiff last night,
but the man left.

452
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,530
What are you up to?

453
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,665
Took him out
in the skiff, you said?

454
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm busy, Poley.
What do you want?

455
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:33,004
I saw Billy and Jonsy
this morning on the river.

456
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,741
Where are they headed?
To Memphis.

457
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,810
You ain't making
no sense and I ain't got
the time to fool with you.

458
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,548
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry to trouble you.

459
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,540

00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,056
♪ Hot nights on the river

476
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,327
♪ Rock on Rock on the bayou

477
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,797

00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:15,801

479
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,371
What the hell
do you think you
are doing, girl?

480
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,740
You get some clothes on!

481
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,008
Ain't nobody here with us.

482
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,409
What do you think
that is, driftwood?

483
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,744
Wexel, go. Get back.

484
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,978
Don't worry about Wexel.

485
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,981
We've been going
skinny-dipping since
he's been walking.

486
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,450
Get out of that water.
No! No, never mind.

487
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,820
What's the matter with you?

488
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,857
Wexel!

489
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,693
I guess you're
worried about incest, huh?

490
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,494
It's just natural.

491
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,063
To be worried about it, I mean.

492
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,199
Do you even know
what those words mean?

493
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,968
I saw a film about it at school.

494
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,372
You wouldn't believe
how many families
got incest in 'em.

495
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,941
If it bothers you,
the best thing to do

496
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:58,944
is just come right out
in the open and talk about it.

497
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:02,280
There are things
that you're not supposed
to be talking about.

498
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,649
You don't talk about
things like that

499
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,183
just like they was
something else.

500
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:08,353
Maybe if you had,
you wouldn't have
got Joyce in trouble.

501
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:09,955
Engine fixed?

502
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,571
Sure a run of bad luck, Doctor.

503
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,774
First you lost your boat.

504
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,275
Now your car's gone.

505
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,645
How far is Memphis by bus?

506
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,947
Oh, two, three hours.

507
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,350
You going after Billy, huh?

508
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,053
He done something wrong?

509
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:45,223
Maybe he had something
to do with that boat ride
y'all took last night,

510
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,992
when you had your accident?

511
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,362
I told you
what happened.
No, sir. You lied to me!

512
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,064
No, that ain't right.

513
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,465
Here it is, I saved your life!

514
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:57,268
You ain't told me
the truth about nothing!

515
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,806
Not about your boat,
nor your car, nor Billy.

516
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,013
What puzzles me is,
why is Billy going
down the river?

517
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,519
Billy ever talk to you
about that money?

518
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:18,123
What money?

519
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,225
That money he stole.

520
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,861
Everybody said it was burnt up.

521
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,964
But I know for a fact
it's hidden downriver
somewheres.

522
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:30,702
What are you
talking about,
Mr. Beck?

523
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:33,638
Somebody who was there
said there's enough money

524
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,842
hid downriver
to make a man rich.

525
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,110
Of course, educated people
don't believe it...

526
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:41,012
Billy told you about that money?

527
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,582
Yeah.

528
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,351
Billy told me about it.

529
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:49,320
It's true, ain't it?

530
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,422
I knowed it was true!

531
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:53,591
I knew that money
didn't burn up!

532
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,761
No, it's hid
downriver, ain't it?

533
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,163
And Billy's gone after it!

534
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,736
You know where it is,
too, don't you, Doc?

535
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,806
And you're going to tell...

536
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,841
Ain't you?

537
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,473
What's wrong, Billy?

538
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:51,542
You ain't said
anything for miles.
Ain't you happy?

539
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:53,578
Yes, baby, I'm happy.

540
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,047
I want to tell you about it.

541
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,617
About what?
Robbery, murder.

542
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,619
I want you to understand
what happened.

543
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,658
It was Whitey, Joyce and me.

544
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:11,997
Fooling around,
like we always did.
Had us a picnic.

545
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,999
Whitey stole
some beer someplace.

546
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:24,075
This old widow woman
lived on the river.

547
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,445
Us kids all grew up
having nightmares about her.

548
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,280
Everybody said her husband died,

549
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,349
left her millions of dollars.

550
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,285
She was crazy.

551
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,287
Crazy how?

552
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,356
She lived like a hermit.

553
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,226
Nobody ever saw her,
except glimpses.

554
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,428
Come on.

555
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:46,031
They said
she had all that money
hid in the house,

556
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:49,667
in the walls, and she'd
shoot anybody come near it.

557
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,538
Whitey and me thought
it'd be fun to give
Joyce a good scare.

558
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,806
She said that she'd
do anything we'd do.

559
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,844
So we decided to
break in the house.

560
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,981
Hadn't nobody
ever been in there.

561
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,818
We weren't looking
to steal anything.

562
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:11,222
Just maybe take something
to prove to the other kids
we'd been there.

563
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,864
Hey, come here.
Let's go upstairs.
Come on. Come on.

564
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,132
I'm not going up there.

565
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,467
You said you'd
do anything we do.

566
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,103
Not me. I'm not
gonna go up there.
Uh-uh.

567
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,676
Being there
wasn't enough for Whitey.

568
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,844
He had to see that old woman.

569
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:37,348
He always had to
push things to the limit.

570
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:40,118
He liked trouble
the way some people
like fishing.

571
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,507
She just looked like
a pile of rags laying there.

572
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,146
It was just a game.
That's all.

573
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,250
It was just something to do.

574
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:16,654
Hey, Whitey.

575
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,059
Look at this.

576
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,764
We couldn't believe it.

577
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,035
There couldn't be
that much money in
the whole wide world.

578
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:33,438
Not doing anybody any good,
except her cats.

579
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,809
He didn't even think.

580
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,611
He just snatched that gun...

581
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,117
He said she'd have
killed us if he hadn't.

582
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,127
Billy! Come on!

583
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,664
I was too scared to think.

584
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:02,067
I just left her there,
screaming.

585
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,177
I never will forget
how he looked.

586
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,445
Like it was the best game
we ever played.

587
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,781
Like there was nothing wrong.

588
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,892
We headed off
down the Mississippi.

589
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,363
Now, we knew
if they caught us,
they'd be out for blood.

590
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,234
But the more we drifted,

591
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:39,804
the more it was like
nothing had happened.

592
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,007
Like it was a dream
or something.

593
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,179
Something about that river
seemed to make everything
all right.

594
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,119
If we'd have stayed
on the river, maybe we'd
have been safe.

595
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,522
We went ashore, though,
and stole a car.

596
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,056
And the cops got you.

597
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:00,525
Yeah.

598
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:06,897
Whitey died, the money burned.

599
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,100
Joyce made a deal.

600
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,669
Or her daddy did.

601
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,604
She was a witness against me.

602
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,341
And they gave me life.

603
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:19,310
But Whitey
killed her, not you.
You were just there.

604
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:22,880
Yeah.

605
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:34,419
Is that Memphis?
It is!

606
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,721
Billy, it's Memphis!

607
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,390
I hate Memphis.

608
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,430
Come on, Wexel.

609
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,265
Where's the music coming from?

610
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,933
There must be a band up there.

611
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:52,069
Where there
are tourists. The place is
swarming with them.

612
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,751
There's a telephone booth
standing over there.

613
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:10,255
Want you to call those cousins
of yours and tell them
to come get you.

614
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,657
I ain't got no money.

615
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,792
You worry people enough already.

616
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:18,363
Tell your cousins to call
your aunt and tell her
you're okay.

617
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,197
Why come I can't
stay with y'all?

618
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,146
What are we gonna do first?

619
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,015
We're going to see your mother.

620
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,005
Go on.

621
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:44,849
I'm looking for Joyce.

622
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,452
Hey, Ma, some guy's here.

623
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,320
♪ Take no prisoners

624
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,158
♪ Take no prisoners

625
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,762
♪ We're gonna
take no prisoners ♪

626
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,287
Jonsy?

627
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,460
I've come to see you, Joyce.

628
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,096
I'm out.

629
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,865
What do you want?

630
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,001
To talk.

631
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:39,870
To talk in there.

632
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,210
I had to testify, Billy.

633
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:48,613
I had no choice.
They were gonna
send me to jail, too.

634
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,047
I ain't here about that.

635
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,553
Who are you guys?

636
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,557
Uh, I guess I'm your sister...

637
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,925
Sort of.

638
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,326
Your half-sister.

639
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,028
I already got a half-sister.

640
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,730
She lives with Daddy.

641
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,966
I've been thinking
about you every night
for the last 13 years.

642
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,702
How come you run off, Joyce?

643
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,906
There wasn't any word
or no letters.

644
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,243
There wasn't nothing.

645
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:20,745
You went to prison for life.

646
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,749
I had a baby.
I was barely 16 years old.

647
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,687
What'd you come here for?

648
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,524
In prison, you get to
thinking that if you could
just get out of there,

649
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:36,060
ain't nothing you couldn't do.

650
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,962
I come to see
if there's a chance.

651
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,733
You got to go.

652
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,970
Somebody's going
to be here any minute.

653
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,872
You got a man.

654
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,540
I got a lot of men.

655
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:52,276
I ain't asking you
to just pick up
and run off with me.

656
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,613
I just want you
to think about it.

657
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:57,548
What's that guy want with Ma?

658
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:01,251
There's something else, too.

659
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,688
That money we took
is still there, most of it.

660
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:05,990
I'm going after it for us.

661
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,493
Money?

662
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,061
It's our money, free and clear.

663
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,532
I paid for it with
13 years out of my life.

664
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,201
We could have a life together.

665
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,207
I don't know you.

666
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,943
You're just something
that happened a long
time ago.

667
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,582
You ruined my life
for a stupid kid's joke!

668
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:33,484
Billy.

669
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,419
Billy, we got
to get out of here.

670
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,487
Jonsy, wait.

671
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,490
Don't leave.

672
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:40,958
I've got to talk to you.

673
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:42,793
To explain.

674
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,162
It wasn't all my fault.

675
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:47,832
Jonsy.

676
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,668
Please, talk to me.

677
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,269
It's okay.

678
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,406
Maybe I would've run away,
too, if I'd been you.

679
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,048
Why didn't you tell me
about the money?

680
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,149
I couldn't tell you.

681
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,851
You couldn't tell me,
but you told her?

682
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,653
Shouldn't have told her.
I shouldn't have told nobody.

683
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,521
That's what this is
all for, weren't it?

684
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:11,689
Building the boat, the trip.

685
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:14,358
Everything was
for the money and Joyce.

686
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,861
Why did they let you out?
Why didn't they just
keep you in jail?

687
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,062
You think they let
me out of there?

688
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,130
I bought my way out of there
with that damn money.

689
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,432
Everything in Stockman
is for sale, honey.

690
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,569
Dr. Cole is the one
who fixes who gets
out and who don't.

691
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:26,871
I made a deal
to get the money
for him.

692
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:28,773
But they were about
to catch up with him,

693
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:30,841
and something
bad happened.
What happened?

694
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,677
He showed up threatening
to take me back to jail

695
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,613
if I didn't get the money
for him right then.
He put a gun on me.

696
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,482
Thought I'd killed him.

697
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,484
I didn't aim to or nothing.

698
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,722
That man's crazy, baby.

699
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,825
He's a killer.

700
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,827
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've helped you.

701
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,896
Can't nobody help me.

702
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,364
I got to get away by myself.

703
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:56,366
I am putting you
on a bus for home.

704
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:11,081
Doggone you, Wexel,
you were supposed
to call your cousins.

705
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,751
Wasn't nobody home.

706
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:16,954
It don't matter.
You and me are taking
a bus up home anyway.

707
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,729
It's him.
It's that man!

708
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:33,137
Well, Billy.

709
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,075
You let us all down.

710
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,782
I'll get that
money for you, Doc,
without any tricks.

711
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:45,983
Just let them children go.

712
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:49,186
And they're gonna
keep all those secret,
is that it?

713
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,421
Now look, Billy,
I got to have that money.

714
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,524
And so do you.

715
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:58,195
I'll make a deal with you,
I'll split it
with you equally.

716
00:59:58,228 --> 00:59:59,463
That way we'll both have a stake

717
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,265
in getting there safely.

718
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:04,001
But I'm warning you, Billy.
One more betrayal...

719
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,611
Well, children,

720
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:18,382
we're going
to have ourselves
an adventure.

721
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:21,986
We're going to go on
a good old-fashioned
treasure hunt.

722
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,222
We're gonna find the treasure,

723
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:28,926
go our separate ways,
and we're all gonna
live happily ever after.

724
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:34,431
It's going to be fun.

725
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,986
Hold it, boys.
Don't get near the body.

726
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,555
Thought you was all
finished with him, Sheriff.

727
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,425
I am.
It's you boys
I'm thinking of.

728
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,227
What do you mean, Sheriff?

729
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,029

Damn these mosquitoes,
obnoxious music.

771
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:08,072
All right.
Everybody stays on the boat.

772

Don't talk to nobody.

773

somebody has to get some.

775
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:24,321
That hot dog stand
right there will be just fine.

776
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:26,790
You go get it, Billy,

777
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,459
and you keep in sight.

778
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:32,562
I'll just stay
here with the children.

779
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:50,514
How far to the money, Billy?

780
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:53,783
How long?

781
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,191
Okay.

782
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,527
Okay.
Play it your way.

783
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:11,101
The power of environment.

784
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:15,439
That's what makes
men criminals, Jonsy.

785
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,843
I suppose I'm proof
after 20 years at Stockman.

786
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,446
But now you, Billy,

787
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,383
you grew up in an
idyllic environment, huh?

788
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,152
Full of sunshine and love,

789
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,822
and yet you murdered
that old woman.

790
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:35,092
He didn't!
He was just there.

791
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,393
Whitey did it all!

792
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,496
Is that what he told you?

793
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,998
You kind of changed
your story, didn't you, Billy?

794
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:43,167
You're lying.

795
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,669
I never knew a con yet
that wasn't innocent.

796
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,970
You know you're lying.

797
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,406
There's always
somebody else to blame.

798
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:53,177
Go after her.
Bring her back.

799
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:57,681
Jonsy!

800
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,084
♪ There's so many teachers

801
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,352

802
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,822

811
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,561
You lied to me again.

812
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,630
No, I didn't, baby.

813
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,432
I swear,
Doc's the one that's lying.

814
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,367
He's trying to play
us off against each other.

815
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,635
I don't believe you.

816
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,337
Hell, ain't nobody ever
has believed me.

817
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,339
I don't guess
you're any different.

818
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,377
I don't care
if you killed nobody.

819
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,845
It doesn't matter.

820
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,748
Baby, it matters a lot.

821
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:07,817
It matters a whole lot.

822
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,594
I believe you.

823
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,530
I believe you didn't do it.

824
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:24,000
We got to stick together, okay?

825
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,169
When we get the money,

826
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,736
we'll just keep going together.

827
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:29,406
I'll help you and things.

828
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,674
But you got to promise me

829
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,143
that you'll take me with you
when you get the money.

830
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,649
It okay if I dance
with your girl?

831
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:41,651
Leave us alone.

832
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:47,023
Dance with him if you want to.

833
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:50,227
I don't want to.
Why not?

834
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,263
I don't know how.
What do you mean,
you don't know how?

835
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,764
Every kid knows how to dance.

836
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:55,999
Not me.

837
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,238
I used to know how to dance.

838
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,407
If I ain't forgot,
I'll show you.

839
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,974
You got dancing in prison?

840
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:07,143
We got everything
in prison.
Look here now.

841
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,679
Step down a little.

842
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,681
Now come back this way.

843
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:12,849
Now step up a little.

844
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,150
Now step back.

845
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:17,787
Now step back.
Now turn sideways one time.

846
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,690
Now step back.
Step back here.

847
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:22,058
Now step up here.

848
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,995
Step up. Step back.

849
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:27,764
Step down.

850
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,337
Life is full
of surprises,
huh, sport?

851
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,105
How about some dessert?

852
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:39,709
Dessert?

853
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:42,145
You got room for dessert
after all that popcorn?

854
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:44,914
Yeah...

855
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:46,115
How about ice cream?

856
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,685
You like ice cream?

857
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,788
Let's get
some ice cream.
Maybe it'll cool us off.

858
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,961
He couldn't have done it, Cal.

859
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:04,200
The police was here
after they'd already gone.

860
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:07,237
We don't really know
where they went
when they left here.

861
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:10,574
I called the
authorities in Memphis.
They'll talk to Joyce.

862
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:13,176
The Coast Guard'll be
looking for them
on the river.

863
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,779
Vadie, that's evidence.

864
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,354
My auntie say

865
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:59,188
thunder means
the devil's walking,

866
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:00,657
looking for souls to catch.

867
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,158
You shut up about your auntie.

868
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,360
You're as crazy as she is.

869
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:05,729
She says she
seen the devil
up in St. Louis.

870
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,830
Sure. Where else?

871
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:12,836
My daddy used
to say this old river
had one ghost a mile.

872
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:16,306
He'd tell us about
pirates and soldiers,
Indians.

873
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,241
He'd say, "Look yonder,
there goes one
of them right now."

874
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,345
I never did look in time.

875
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,247
Why do we try to
frighten our children

876
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,815
with stories
of the supernatural?

877
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:30,487
The natural world
is far more terrifying.

878
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,991
Come on, Wexel,
let's get inside.

879
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,705
What's the matter with you?

880
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:51,007
I don't know.
I'm sick.

881
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,108
Got an infection.

882
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,911
Allergic reaction to the sun

883
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,813
or the mosquitoes
or this damn river.

884
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,081
Billy, we got
to get off this river.

885
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,248
We're staying on this river.

886
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:00,817
Why? So that another
accident can happen?

887
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,587
Now, I'm warning you, Billy.
I'm warning you.
One more trick...

888
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,989
I saved you back there,
now didn't I?

889
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,995
Billy.

890
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,667
Something happened
upriver, Billy.

891
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:21,705
A man was murdered.

892
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:24,674
A fat, dirty, little man
named Poley Beck.

893
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:28,011
You killed Poley Beck?

894
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,546
I didn't kill him, Billy.
Why would I kill him?

895
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:31,147
I didn't even know the man.

896
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:34,418
No, you see...

897
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:37,521
There was this
little gold necklace
found on the body.

898
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:40,557
An Elvis Presley necklace
with your initials
on the back.

899
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,727
So you see, Billy.

900
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,396
You see, you're
going to need me now
more than ever.

901
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:55,739
Billy!

902
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,241
Billy, be careful!

903
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:08,918
What is it?

904
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:12,889
What is it?

905
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,125
I don't know.

906
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,894
Lightning must have
struck something.

907
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:21,465
All right, inside.

908
01:13:21,498 --> 01:13:23,032
Get inside.
Everybody inside!

909
01:13:25,802 --> 01:13:26,803
All right.

910
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:30,373
All right, we've all
been telling ghost stories.

911
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,575
Now you tell a story, Billy.

912
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:35,211
You tell me where
that money is. Now.

913
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:38,882
We left the river
about a day from here.

914
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,551
I hot-wired this Cajun's car.
Skip the details.

915
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,987
Just tell me where the money is.

916
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,057
I'm telling you
how to get there, Doc.

917
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,932
We passed through
a little crossroads

918
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,101
called Devil's Head, Louisiana.

919
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,269
Our luck had run out.

920
01:14:00,303 --> 01:14:02,305
I went speeding
right past this cop.

921
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,926
Whitey said
if they caught us,
they'd burn us both.

922
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:26,362
He brought them all down on us.

923
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,446
- I'm warning you, Billy.
- Quit stalling.

924
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:49,085
The road dead-ended
at this Cajun cemetery.

925
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:51,354
There was a funeral
just letting out.

926
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:04,267
Whitey looked dead.

927
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,736
I figured
they'd kill me, too,
if they got me.

928
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:09,739
So I run.

929
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:14,510
But you took the money with you.

930
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,580
Huh?

931
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:19,482
You hid the money
after the accident,
not before.

932
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:23,352
Where?

933
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:29,058
Okay, get back.
Get away from the car!
Move!

934
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:47,543
I couldn't let them
catch me with that money.

935
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,114
I had to get rid of it.

936
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,223
I'm betting you hid
the money in a coffin.

937
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:02,692
That's perfect.

938
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,463
All right now, Billy,

939
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,432
what was the name
of the cemetery?

940
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,770
The Cajuns called it
La Croix Cassee.

941
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,538
"The broken cross."

942
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,541
Good.

943
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,076
Now, what's the name
on the grave?

944
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:28,384
Tell me the name, Billy.

945
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,954
Don't tell him, Billy.
He'll kill us.

946
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:35,091
Tell me the name on the grave!

947
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:37,460
I'll tell you!
Just leave her alone, Doc.

948
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,195
Take it easy. I'll tell you.

949
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:50,740
Billy.

950
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:52,175
Billy, look.

951
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:57,681
Lightning
struck a barge!
That's a runaway!

952
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:14,197
Start the engine!
Put it in reverse!

953
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,033
We got to get out
of here. That thing
is going to blow up.

954
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,111
Billy, the barge.
We've got to see
if anybody's alive!

955
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,146
There's nothing we can do, baby.

956
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,548
If Doc hasn't been killed,
he'll be right after us.

957
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,886
Besides, this place is gonna
be crawling with Coast Guard.
We can't stay here.

958
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:23,232
It's all right, baby.

959
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:25,869
We'll be there soon.
It'll all be over.

960
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,039
I don't want it to be over.

961
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,608
You ought to let me get you
to a doctor, mister.

962
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,710
No, that's all right.
I'll take care of it.

963
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,580
I've been eaten up
by mosquitoes,
I must be allergic to them.

964
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:13,416
That ain't no mosquito.

965
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:14,851
That's poison ivy.

966
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:17,854
Poison ivy?

967
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:22,091
You must have laid
down and wallowed in it.

968
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,460
I had it worse
than that when I was a kid.

969
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,762
Eyes swollen shut.

970
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,933
Whole body swole
up like a tomato.

971
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,868
My own mama didn't recognize me.

972
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,205
I'm serious, mister.

973
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,308
That's gonna get a whole lot
worse unless you get help.

974
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:48,051
Think she'll
be safe here?
Oh, yeah.

975
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:50,319
Maybe we'll
find a way to get
her back home.

976
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,321
Guess we can
do anything once
we get the money.

977
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:53,722
When are we gonna eat?

978
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,324
Better find something.

979
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:01,464
First thing we gotta
do is find a way to get
Wexel back home somehow.

980
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,933
Then we can go anyplace we want.

981
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,802
Listen, baby...
How far's the cemetery?

982
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,637
It's a few miles that way.

983
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,373
Do we have to walk all that way?

984
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,375
How else we going to get there?

985
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,383
Look at what they've done.

986
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:21,918
Figure it'll still be there?

987
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,556
What's the matter, Billy.
Why are you stopping here?

988
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,292
I was
just wondering
what kind of man

989
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,494
would take children
into a place like this.

990
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,163
It's only a graveyard.

991
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,798
Yeah.

992
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,343
There's so many tombs.

993
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,012
You know which one it is?

994
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,380
Yeah.

995
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:06,662
Lying on a body all those years.

996
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,898
Will we still
be able to spend it,
won't we?

997
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,069
Let me tell you
something, darlin'.

998
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:16,005
This ain't no damn game
we're playing.

999
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:19,442
Doc didn't kill Poley Beck.
He made it look like I did.

1000
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,377
They out there looking
for me right now.

1001
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,113
Doc killed Poley?
Yeah.

1002
01:21:24,147 --> 01:21:26,682
I ain't gonna let them
send me to jail
for it either.

1003
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,584
I'll die first.

1004
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,819
I can tell them about Doc.
They'd believe me.

1005
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,656
Yeah, they'd believe
you'd lie for me.

1006
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:36,325
We ain't gonna
have no life together, baby.

1007
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,994
I ain't meant to have a life.

1008
01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:39,996
All I can do is run.

1009
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:43,666
No, Billy.
Listen, maybe if you
turned in the money,

1010
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:44,934
they'd believe you.

1011
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:47,603
If we just went back
with the money together,

1012
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:49,705
they'll know
we were telling
the truth about Doc.

1013
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,540
I'd make them believe us.

1014
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:53,809
It's all over, baby.

1015
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:55,811
Quit dreaming.

1016
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:00,716
It doesn't
have to be over, Billy.

1017
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:04,520
We'll go to Sheriff Cal
with the money,
he'll believe us then.

1018
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:07,590
Billy, it'd be all right
if we just turned
in the money.

1019
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:15,064
Don't touch it.

1020
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,034
Don't.

1021
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,075
No!

1022
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:28,978
Billy!

1023
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:43,759
Children!

1024
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:49,765
Where are you, children?

1025
01:22:58,241 --> 01:23:00,143
Don't run away
from me, children.

1026
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:04,880
Jonsy?

1027
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,053
Jonsy?

1028
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:13,622
Wexel.

1029
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,358
Where are you, children?

1030
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,795
I'm not going to hurt you.

1031
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,273
I just want to talk to you.

1032
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,744
I want to explain things to you.

1033
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:37,313
Jonsy? Sport?

1034
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,986
Come on, now.
This is old Doc.

1035
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:47,990
Come on, now.
Come on out.

1036
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:00,603
I can see you
in there, children.

1037
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:05,374
Come on now.
I know you're in there.
Come on out.

1038
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,776
Come on out and talk to me.

1039
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,645
You know, I'm gonna
get angry, children.

1040
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,568
Billy!

1041
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:36,038
Don't die, please!
Don't die.

1042
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,740
Please!
Mr. McCain.

1043
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,111
Billy, Billy...

1044
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:44,980
He's coming back.

1045
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,466
Then this barge
come and blowed up, man.

1046
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,534
Then we come to this graveyard.

1047
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:07,903
And he chopped open that grave.

1048
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:11,340
I seen them cat food
boxes laying on that
dead skeleton.

1049
01:25:11,374 --> 01:25:14,610
Then here come Doc.
He looked just
like a big monster.

1050
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:24,253
My cousins see
me coming this time.

1051
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:26,155
Man, they better watch out.

1052
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:32,228
How come you talk like that?

1053
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:34,730
I can't understand
a word they're saying.

1054
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,632
All right,
you're ready
to talk to me now?

1055
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,335
Did you call Sheriff Cal?

1056
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:41,870
Getting a plane.
Be here this afternoon.

1057
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:45,541
All right, no more tall tale.

1058
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:49,512
What the hell were you
doing in that graveyard
at the middle of the night?

1059
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:50,879
You know tourists.

1060
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,115
They'll do anything.

1061
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:55,918
I got to see Billy now.

1062
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:01,290
Don't worry, chere.
He is not hurt real bad.

1063
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,393
He's a pretty lucky fella,
your papa.

1064
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:09,765
You're a long way
from home, huh, chere?

1065
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,734
We came down the river together.

1066
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:16,905
Daddy loves the river.

1067
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,476
He loves taking me
places with him, too.

1068
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:26,815
When we get back home
and get settled
and everything,

1069
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,753
we're going to plan
another trip somewhere.

1070
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,957
We're just going
to keep traveling.

1071
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:38,861
See the whole country, maybe.

1072
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,081
Baby...

1073
01:27:00,283 --> 01:27:01,917
Whatever happens,

1074
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:05,254
whatever they do to me in here,

1075
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:11,394
you're my daughter,
and I love you.

1076
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:20,936
Ready to answer
my questions now?

1077
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:22,571
Keep away from him!

1078
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,907
He didn't do anything.
It was Dr. Cole.

1079
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,442
Everything was for the money.

1080
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:28,844
Money? What money?

1081
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:30,579
What money you talking about?

1082
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,849
What's going on around here?

1083
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,300
Look, look over there.

1084
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,472
Look! There's more.

1085
01:27:58,541 --> 01:27:59,675
Look!

1086
01:28:10,553 --> 01:28:12,054
Easy, Jonsy.

1087
01:28:12,755 --> 01:28:13,822
Cal.

1088
01:28:13,856 --> 01:28:15,791
It's just poison ivy.

1089
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,960
I found Poley Beck
dead in a patch of it.

1090
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:21,697
That's where he must've got it.

1091
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:23,499
He's covered with it,
Sheriff Cal.

1092
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:25,368
Doc is. Dr. Cole.

1093
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:26,735
That proves he killed Poley.

1094
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:28,337
You got to believe me.

1095
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:30,238
I know all about
Dr. Cole, Jonsy.

1096
01:28:38,381 --> 01:28:39,915
What's going to happen to Billy?

1097
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,118
We'll keep him home.

1098
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,405
I'm sorry, sport.

1099
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:25,060
I guess after
what you've been through,

1100
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:28,230
you'll be glad
to stay in your
own backyard a while, eh?

1101
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:30,032
Our backyard's
the Mississippi river.

1102
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:45,914
♪ Follow me

1103
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:54,457
♪ Whispers the river's song

1104
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:58,427
♪ Come back to me

1105
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:03,766
♪ Softly she sings

1106
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:07,670
♪ Gently she brings me home

1107
01:30:10,673 --> 01:30:13,476
♪ And the tears are washed away
