306
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:10,339
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.

307
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:19,635
A machine?

308
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:25,186
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

309
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:27,033
A cybernetic organism.

310
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,992
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

311
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:34,512
Get your head down!

312
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:22,693
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

313
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:27,364
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

314
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:31,185
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

315
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,620
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

316
00:41:33,956 --> 00:41:38,109
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

317
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,677
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...

318
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:42,914
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.

319
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:52,140
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.

320
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,776
But these are new.
They look human...

321
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:58,863
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

322
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,833
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

323
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:08,498
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

324
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:12,585
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

325
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:19,433
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

326
00:42:19,901 --> 00:42:23,021
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

327
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:27,158
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

328
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:29,411
- Right.
- Right.

329
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:40,838
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

330
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,590
Don't do that again.

331
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:45,093
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

332
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:49,748
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.

333
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,020
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

334
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:59,324
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.

335
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:03,061
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!

336
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:05,913
Until you are dead.

337
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:17,242
Can you stop it?

338
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,930

Why does it want me?

00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:48,249

353
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,960

Most of us were rounded up, put
in camps for orderly disposal.

This was burned in
by laser scanner.

units ran night and day.

We were that close
to going out forever.

373
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:09,839
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

374
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:15,712
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.
