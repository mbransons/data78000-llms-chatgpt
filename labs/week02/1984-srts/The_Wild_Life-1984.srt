      There's a sign out front

00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,677
            You read that?

                Get out...

                the same way
                you got in.

            Thank you very much.

48
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,561
            Dickie doesn't
            work here anymore.

49
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,063
                He got fired.

50
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,564
Shit, that's too bad.
                      Yeah.

51
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,399

some Bloody Mary mixers,

a 12-pack of Bud

while you
ring it up.

57
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,430
Is there a problem?

58
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:16,798
    Not if you have some I.D.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,266

All-state.

63
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,112
            I know. I saw you
            at the invitationals
            last year.

64
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:31,313
                You were great.

65
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,981
Thanks, my man.

66
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:35,617
                Didn't you used
                to go out with
                Mary Moseley?

67
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,268
Oh, yeah!

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,654
I nailed her
in the backseat of my car.

69
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,490
Oh, boy,
was she a hose beast.

70
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,544
        Mary Moseley's
        my little sister.

71
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,548
Did you say
Kleinman or Moseley?

72
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,116
              Moseley.

73
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,502
Oh! Mary Moseley's
a terrific girl.

74
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:56,454
I'm amazed I even got her
confused with Mary Kleinman,

75
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,056
because Mary Moseley's
fantastic.

76
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,308
She's...

77
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,810
she's a fabulous girl.

78
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:03,678
She... she is.

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,463
 Tom, I find it hard to believe
         that you're 28

80
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,481
    and still in high school.

81
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,317
It's for my dad.

82
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,469
See, he's kind of
an alcoholic.

83
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,273
            Sorry.

84
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,778
It's casual.

          ( Radio buzzes )

86
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:45,003
Hey, hey, kid,
we've been waiting here
for 20 minutes!

87
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,688
            I'm sorry, sir.
            One at a time.

( Clamoring )

89
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,693
            What is goin' on?

90
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,816
                Bill, this is
                a league man.

91
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,118
        How many times
        do I have to tell you

92
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,653
    league people don't wait?

93
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,289
          Where's the other kid?

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,374
I'm sure Tommy's on his way.

95
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:08,243
                     On his way?

96
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,528
            I don't pay him
            to be on his way.

97
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
                Now, I am fed up
                with his act.

98
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,633
                If he isn't here
                in ten minutes,
                he's out.

99
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,502
        I'd rather cut him loose
        and give you the raise.

100
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,221
I could use a raise.

101
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,589
                    Ten minutes.

102
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,880
  Hi, Tommy.

103
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,548
Did you see
that bulge he had

104
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,150
in the wrestling
team photo last year?

105
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,935
      I can't believe
      they print those pictures.

106
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,740
        Tommy!

107
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,604
  Ahh!

108
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,940
      Two, three, four and five.

109
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,424
                      Thanks.

110
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,477
     Yo, man.
                     Tommy.

111
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,546
            Been doin' your job
            for two hours.

112
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:19,064
                Get to work.

113
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,615
It's casual.

114
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,182
                  You guys okay?

115
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,332
        Excuse me, miss,

116
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,784
 but could I check the security
     on your back entrance?

117
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,920
            We've had some
            prowler reports
            in the neighborhood.

118
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,371
Sure, Officer.
Go right ahead.

119
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:19,007
    Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

120
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,343
      but we'd rather pay
a precautionary visit like this

121
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,877
    than endanger your safety.

122
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,181
Well, that camera
above the door

123
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:29,167
photographs everyone
as they come in.

124
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,803
            You may photograph
            everyone, miss,

125
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,605
            but, uh...

126
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,175
        does everyone know...

127
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,144
        how to make you...

128
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,349
        squeal with pleasure?

129
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,134
                         Huh?
David, please.

130
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,953
Mr. Carlton only left
a minute ago.

131
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,654
            I know.
            I saw him go.

132
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,381
I missed you tonight.

133
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,633
      There was a huge explosion
      by the high school.

134
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,468
                Hell of a lot
                of damage.

135
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,470
             I grabbed the punks
             who did it.

136
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,838
You okay?

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,506
              It's a job.

138
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:14,379
David, I thought maybe
we could go out tonight.

139
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,048
            Mm-hmm.

140
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,104
It's dangerous.

141
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,733
        Don't worry about it,
        all right?

142
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,702
                I'm a cop.

143
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,759
      ( Heavy breathing )

144
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,782
        Hey, Jim!

145
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:08,900
Jim!

146
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,652
          Hey, Tony, what's up?

147
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,220
How's it goin'?

148
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:13,405
             All right.

149
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,273
Where have
you been?

150
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,825
            Just hangin' out.

151
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,879
                All right!

152
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,580
                Not bad.

153
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,166
    At least you don't look
    like a flamin' geek anymore.

154
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:26,468
Thanks.

155
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,421
 Hey, did you see
 <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
 on cable?

156
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,789
                Eleven times.

157
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:48,656
Just keep that back entrance
double-deadbolted, miss,

158
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:51,076
and I wouldn't
worry about
the prowlers.

159
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,747
Okay. Thank you, Officer.

160
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,461
You're too young
to smoke, son.

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,351
      Hi, Jim.

162
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,669
             Hi, Anita.

163
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,026
            What do you got
            that's fresh?

164
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,061
Oh, everything's fresh.

165
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:29,347
      ( Tires screeching )

166
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,321
Lady, please don't disturb
         league lanes.

167
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,522
        Thank you.

168
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,407
          Sorry, Bill.

169
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,859
                 He is so nice!

170
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,381
You know, Bill,
you're a lucky guy.

171
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,202
You're moving into
the woman palace of all time.

172
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,255
I'm proud of you.

173
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:57,509
'cause when they talk about
the Bill Conrad years,

174
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,761
they'll say,
Bill Conrad?

175
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:03,598
We never knew
just what a wild man
he really was...

176
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,934
until he moved in
to the house of love.

177
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:07,385
         Thanks a lot.

178
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,437
    So I guess
    the first party's

179
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,055
    tomorrow tonight...

180
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,273
        right?

181
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,693
         Not a chance.

182
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,829
              Mistake.

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,370
    ¶ I'm tired of wasting
    all my precious time ¶

184
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:28,089
    ¶ You got to be all mine

185
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,291
        ¶ All mine

186
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,210
        ¶ Foxy lady

187
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,096
        ¶ Here I come

188
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,384
                Hey! Turn
                that shit off.

189
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,256
( Music continues )

190
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,026
            Maybe you didn't
            hear what I said.

191
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,278
            I said
            turn that shit off.

192
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,568
Okay, come on. Let's go.

193
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:01,940
            Get outta here.

194
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,941
You really scare me.

195
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,959
        He's pretty tough, Glen.

196
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,212
            Think you can
            handle him, buddy?

197
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,332
Come on. Hit me.

198
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,302
                Who is this kid?

199
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,971
            You're too young,

200
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:18,806
            and too little
            for me to execute.

201
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:21,459
Then don't
give me shit.

202
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,465
            Fuckin' muscle-heads
            grow up to be cops.

203
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,467
You almost
got us killed.

204
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,353
                Hey, as soon as
                you're scared,
                you're dead.

205
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,322
        Just like Charlie said
        about 'Nam...

206
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,658
        we went in sloppy
        and we came out sloppy.

207
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,693
You told me
I was gonna meet Charlie

208
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:39,861
two weeks ago.

209
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:41,412
            Can't just barge
            in on him.

210
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,314
        Man, Charlie's a vet.

211
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,699
                    Hey, Jim,
                    come here.

212
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,334
                Mom's been
                lookin' for you.

213
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:48,002
                You're supposed
                to be home.

214
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,338
    I'll be home later.

215
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,792
Your brother's
sort of a strange kid.

216
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,634
          You seen Anita lately?

217
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,719
Sure. Why?

218
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,504
            She's a hot babe.

219
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,607
            I think dumping her
            was a major mistake
            on your part.

220
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,393
Anita was nice.
I really liked her.

221
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:16,864
But there is something
so exciting about
complete independence.

222
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,200
                Like what?

223
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,703
Well, you'll see
how it feels

224
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,288
when you graduate.

225
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,039
You move on.

226
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,524
I don't know.

227
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:30,211
You look for something
more than you get
from high school girls.

228
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:32,714
                ( Sighs )
                Like blow jobs?

229
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,582
( Chuckles ) No.

230
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,884
Like a mature
relationship.

231
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:39,087
See, I'm almost 19.

232
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,472
I can't still
be hangin' around
Alexander High

233
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,341
waitin' to pick up
my girlfriend.

234
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,892
It's embarrassing.

235
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,546
                 Absolutely.

236
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,098
Good night.

237
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,185
     Bill.

238
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,405
Did you know that Anita
had another boyfriend?

239
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,073
                    Really?

240
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,726
I think
it's an older guy.

241
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,779
        Wow. Good for her.

242
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,414
    I'm really happy for her.

243
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,668
                    Good night.

244
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,905
    All right.

245
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,591
      ( Bottle shatters )

246
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,965
                Okay, who's your
                new boyfriend?

247
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:27,418
Who told you
I had a new boyfriend?

248
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,304
            It doesn't matter.
            Just tell me.
            Is it true?

249
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:33,358
Listen, Bill,
I'm trying
to work here, okay?

250
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,413
    Reggie?
                Yeah.

251
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,281
The receipts
are in the drawer.

252
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,599
          Okay, babe.

253
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,872
We're just goin' out.

254
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,290
        Great. That's great.

255
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,075
            I have to find out
            from other people.

256
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,877
     I found out from Tom Drake.

257
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,079
You're the one
who needed your freedom.

258
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,581
        REGGIE: How you
          doing there?

259
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:00,251
    Okay. Well, I didn't know
    that was an excuse for you

260
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,387
            to start goin' out
            with the entire
            male race.

261
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,955
Look, Bill, you're not
my boyfriend anymore, okay?

262
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,846
    Fine. We don't go out
         for three months,

263
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,398
     and this is what happens.

264
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,233
Three months
is a long time

265
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:18,770
when you don't have
anybody to go out with.

266
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,356
      Well, since when do you
    have to go out all the time?

267
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,643
            We used to have fun
            just stayin' in.

268
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,578
Look, Bill,
I gotta go, okay?

269
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,364
Call me sometime.

270
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,916
        Bye, Reggie.

271
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,201
You got it.

272
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,960
Have a maple bar, brother.

273
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,095
They're fresh.

274
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,563
            It's great stuff.

275
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:04,949
         Enjoy.
Thanks a lot.

276
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,734
Good night.
Good night.

277
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,402
Great sale, kiddo.

278
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:09,987
Listen, this isn't
a criticism, okay?

279
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,123
I'm not
comin' down on you.

280
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,024
It's just,
as well as selling pieces--

281
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,743
Like, what'd you sell,
pants and a shirt?

282
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:16,878
                 Two shirts.

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,246
Two shirts is great,

284
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:20,665
but we're goin' for
a whole look thing here, okay?

285
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,800
So think beads and belts
and bracelets--

286
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,087
whatever else you can sell
for the whole ensemble thing,
ya know?

287
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,723
            I tried. She didn't
            have the money.

288
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,541
Well, you know,
go with your instincts.

289
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,009
It's workin'
for you. It's great.

290
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,262
     Hey, Anita, I'm almost
    outta here, okay?

291
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:35,897
            I saw David tonight.

292
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:36,931
          You did?

293
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,268
     Let me just close up
        the register.

294
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,889
      We'll get outta here.

295
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,695
            You said you wanted
            an adventure.

296
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,564
            I just can't believe
            it's with a cop.

297
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,066
He doesn't act
like a cop, though.

298
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,586
            Do you realize
            he could arrest you
            for being underage?

299
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:01,422
Bill was nice.

300
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:06,677
We only did it
about...four, five times.

301
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,681
But David...

302
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:17,054
The way he just
grabbed me and kissed me.

303
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,307
I didn't even
have a choice.

304
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,692
He just
had to have me.

305
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,195
Tommy used to be like that...

306
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,763
            sort of.

307
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,400
Well, every book I read

308
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,320
said it wouldn't happen
till I was 25.

309
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:35,706
And then... it happened.

310
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,159
    Boom!

311
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,945
My first orgasm.

312
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,967
        ( Horn honking )

313
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,840
    ( Music playing loudly )

314
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,964
          ( Chirping )

315
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,578
    ( Loud music continues )

316
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,986
              Jim!

317
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,264
Jim!

318
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,634
Could you please
turn off that music?!

319
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,469
     ( Turns volume down )

320
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,483
( Turns volume lower )

321
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:55,853
        Mom says you
        came home with beer on
        your breath tonight.

322
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,955
So what?

323
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,541
      Look, Jim, I'm not
      in the mood for your shit.

324
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,293
          ( Turns music off )

325
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,861
What do you care?

326
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,379
You're moving out.

327
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:08,582
    You're too young to be out
    running around all night.

328
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,718
    You have school next week.

329
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,673
I haven't decided
if I'm going yet,
all right?

330
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,475
                Why don't you
                get real, Jim?

331
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,976
                You're 15.

332
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,678
            You have no choice
              in the matter.

333
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,348
            Mom doesn't need
            the grief, okay?

334
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,150
You care about Mom?

335
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,769
That's a laugh.

336
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:31,989
You're the one with
the Playboy apartment, not me.

337
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,274
            Hey, I earned it.

338
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,242
            I'm five years older
            than you.

339
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:38,062
            But I'm here for you
            anytime you need me.

340
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,082
Don't give me
that older-brother shit.

341
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:45,002
Man, why don't you
just go bowling?

342
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,956
        Everybody's a comedian.

343
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,209
             Okay.

344
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,428
If you want to hang around
    here all day long

345
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,246
         playing army,
    it's fine with me.

346
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,220
( Chirping )

347
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,926
    ( Turns music on )

348
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,613
             Tommy!

349
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,982
I can't believe you!

350
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,653
            I can't believe you.

351
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,038
            Who do you think
            you are?

352
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,623
            You can't just come
            walking in here.

353
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,125
            You can't keep
            doing that to me.

354
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,093
Eileen, I've been
thinking about you
all day.

355
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,661
Let me give you
a back rub.

356
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,963
                      No way!

357
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,464
What?
                         Shh!

358
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,800
                You'll wake up
                my mom and dad.

359
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,769
They love me.
Give me a kiss.

360
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,003
                    Look...

361
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,773
        if you wanna see me,
        you have to call first.

362
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,008
        And don't just come by
        work, either.

363
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,561
            You'll only get me
            into trouble there.

364
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,782
Eileen, I only
wanna stay for
a few hours.

365
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,650
            I'm serious, Tommy.

366
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,952
        If you don't get
        outta here right now,
        I'm gonna scream.

367
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,154
You won't scream.

368
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,189
        I'll wake up my dad,
        I'll wake up my mom,

369
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,240
        I'll wake up everybody.

370
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:47,357
You won't scream.

371
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,358
                I'll scream.

372
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
You won't scream.

373
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,379
        Look, Anita's boyfriend
        brings her champagne,

374
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:56,700
            and you...you just
            come crawling in
            through the window.

375
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,135
        You take me for granted.

376
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,255
That's not true, Eileen.

377
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,891
What about your birthday?

378
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,843
I was there.

379
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,377
What about
your tonsillectomy?

380
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,513
I was there, Eileen.
I was the only one there.

381
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:13,651
When you thought
Esther Davidson had
a better body than you,

382
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,519
I was there...

383
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,604
to comfort you.

384
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:17,988
        You're right, Tommy.

385
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,357
    Whenever I feel terrible,
    you're always there.

386
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,076
See?

387
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,894
You don't really
wanna scream.

388
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,081
Gimme a kiss.

389
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,759
      ( Eileen screaming )

390
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,182
  ( Garbage cans clattering )

391
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,851
      TOMMY: I'll be back!

392
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,211
                MOM: Billy?

393
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:15,445
         Billy, where are you?

394
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,399
            Oh, there you are.

395
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:20,301
Mom, what are you doing?

396
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:21,952
        Isn't this wonderful?

397
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,287
            I borrowed it
            from the Thompsons.

398
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,672
            It's so easy to use.

399
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:25,973
            Oh, that's nice.

400
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:28,292
You don't have to make
such a big deal about this.

401
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,294
I mean, I'm still
gonna see you.

402
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,346
            My eldest son
            is leaving home,

403
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,964
            and I want
            a record of this.

404
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,182
            Oh, that
            looks wonderful.

405
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,484
    Mom...

406
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,738
            Billy, are you sure
            you wanna do this?

407
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,773
Mom, you said--

408
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,325
        Fold them very neatly.

409
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,993
        Fold them neatly.

410
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,945
Mom, you said
when I was 18,

411
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,479
I could do
what I wanted.

412
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,814
This is what I want.

413
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,284
I mean, I saved up
all summer long for this,

414
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,651
and I already
have the place.

415
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,953
            Take the hanger.

416
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,488
Stop. Take pictures of Jim.

417
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,323
            Oh, Jim!
    That's a wonderful idea.

418
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,158
He should be
in this shot.

419
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,159
Jim, come here.

420
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,260
I want you...

421
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,545
Jim, would you
come here?

422
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,964
I want you to stand
next to your brother.

423
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,382
That's good.
Stand right next...

424
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:12,052
No, just look at
each other.

425
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,370
That's nice.

426
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,772
                  Gimme a break.

427
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:18,642
Oh, the blanket!

428
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,179
Oh, Billy,
you look so young.

429
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,316
You don't even have
any hair on your chest.

430
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,852
    Mom, Dad left home
        when he was 17.

431
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,039
Your father left us
when he was 40, remember?

432
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,207
     Go back in the closet.

433
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,525
Bill, you don't
have to do this.

434
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,528
You could stay here,
you wouldn't have
to pay rent.

435
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,865
        Mom, I love you.

436
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,334
             But...

437
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:46,553
Bill, say that
in the camera, dear.

438
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,038
        Mom, I love you.

439
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,341
  No, the way you did before.
  You know, with more feeling.

440
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,261
        Look, it's only
        14 blocks away.

441
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:57,731
JIM: Ooh, big man.
14 blocks.

442
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,067
      Hey, get lost, Jim.

443
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,568
You're really
takin' off.

444
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,820
        Screw off.

445
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,889
                         Jim!

446
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,825
Jim, this is
a permanent record.

447
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,476
You shouldn't do that.

448
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,061
        Billy, get back in here.

449
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,464
                    Billy.
Geez, Mom.

450
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,767
I'm not gonna
bullshit you, Bill.

451
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:35,919
I know it's tough
for a guy like you

452
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,105
to afford
a place like this,

453
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:42,426
but you seem like
the kind of guy
that can handle it, huh?

454
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,928
        Thank you, Mr. Davis.

455
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,232
Oh, lots of girls!

456
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,766
This way, Bill.
This way, boy.

457
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,319
                I thought I was
                getting Unit 32.

458
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,121
We had to rent
that one out.

459
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:56,440
But listen,
since you're
a first-time renter,

460
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,409
I'm gonna do
you one better.

461
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,378
I'm gonna put you
in the northern corner--
Unit 93.

462
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,746
        You're gonna love it.

463
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,566
The northern corner?
          The northern corner.
          Whoa!

464
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:08,836
      It sounds all right,
 but I'd like to see it first.

465
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:10,587
Okay. Now,
if you like it,

466
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,256
it'll mean
a slightly larger
security deposit.

467
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,292
About 950--
that's not including
the pool key.

468
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,095
        That's about $100 more
        than I brought.

469
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,397
Hey, no problem.
Are you kidding?

470
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,516
We'll just put it
on the next rent check.

471
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:25,652
I've really been
looking forward
to living here, Mr. Davis.

472
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:27,488
          We've been looking
          forward to having you.

473
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,140
         It's quiet,
         it's spacious here
         in the northern corner.

474
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,110
                On top of that,
                a lot of doctors
                live here.

475
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,313
    Prepare yourself.

476
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,998
         ( mice squeaking )

477
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,033
I don't wanna say
too much, Bill.

478
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:41,985
Just stand here
a moment.

479
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,789
You feel it, Bill?

480
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,424
It's the wild life.

481
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,492
  ( Water splashing in pool )

482
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:53,797
Huh?

483
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,667
              I love it.

484
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,391
TOMMY: Sorry I'm late.

485
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:06,143
I had to go
to the hospital

486
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,479
and donate some blood
for my dad.

487
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,731
              BILL: It's amazing
              he's still alive.

488
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,282
                I moved in
                this morning.

489
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,650
                It's great.

490
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,236
            I can stay up
            as late as I want,

491
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,955
                I can sleep in.

492
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,573
            I can do anything.

493
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:21,959
            I know I wasn't
            the most outgoing
            guy in high school,

494
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,495
            but I really think
            this experience
            is gonna change me.

495
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,580
            I'm in
            the real world now.

496
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:29,216
I can do
whatever I want
at home right now.

497
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:31,468
        No, it's not the same.

498
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,220
        You'll know
        when you get there.

499
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:34,471
        It's different.

500
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,973
        You missed a piece.

501
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,341
I know.

502
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,009
I don't need
this shit, man.

503
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm a specialist.

504
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,379
I could be teaching
little kids how to wrestle.

505
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,123
                Be right back.

506
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:23,753
Do we know you?

507
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,056
                    No.

508
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,725
    Where's the war?
    ( Scoffs )

509
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,429
                        Hi.

510
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,097
        Hi.

511
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,699
You know
this guy?

512
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,367
     Not really.

513
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,537
Get outta here.

514
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,880
                Do you see this?

515
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,556
          Next time,
          it's your face, clown.

516
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,402
                See ya later.

517
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,644
You're up.

518
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,877
Five orders of fries,
Tommy.

519
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:38,161
Thanks.

520
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,963
Guys, live it up.

521
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,215
It's on me.

522
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:44,551
I have something
very important to tell you.

523
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:46,687
                Are we talking
                about a party?

524
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:49,022
I've been up all night.

525
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,525
Eileen and I
are gonna be married.

526
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:52,976
    Bullshit.

527
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,811
It's true.

528
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,481
I've nailed
my share of babes.

529
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,702
They call me,
they hang around.

530
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:03,737
They sit on
my car.

531
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:06,657
It's gotten old.
    ( Loud cracking )

532
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,209
            Yeah, but you don't
            have to get married.

533
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,528
    Yeah, why buy the milk
    when the cow is free?

534
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,381
Yeah, well, I didn't say
I was getting married yet.

535
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:16,750
I just said
I was getting engaged.

536
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:19,252
Get our pictures
in the paper.

537
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,205
Scholarship guys see it.

538
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:27,260
It's good for
the relationship.

539
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:29,379
It's good all around.

540
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,398
     Swine.

541
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:35,852
Hey, Eileen's
a great girl.

542
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,854
I love her.

543
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,774
        Congratulations, buddy.

544
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:41,775
Thanks.

545
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:45,245
Where's the stag party?

546
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,699
Where else? Les Girls.

547
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,784
  Les Girls?!

548
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:52,569
  You'll never get in.

549
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,571
It's all set up.

550
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,674
                Unbelievable!

551
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,628
            I knew a guy
            who knew this guy

552
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,180
          who got in there once.

553
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,098
            They have girls
            for everybody, man.

554
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,351
            You can have a girl
            and a steak

555
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,770
            and put them both
            on a credit card.

556
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:13,056
        Visa or Mastercharge.

557
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,729
    ( All grunting loudly )

558
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,931
      Yeah.

559
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,368
Guys, I'm late for work.

560
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,952
( Pounds table )

561
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,904
                WAITRESS:
                That'll be 5.50.

562
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,742
You really think
this looks good on me?

563
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,210
            It makes you look
            like Sting.

564
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:36,446
This is all right.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take it.

565
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,581
                        Great.

566
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,665
Here.

567
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:39,833
                    Is it yours?

568
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:41,668
Well, no,
but it's my father's,

569
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,503
and I reimburse him, so...

570
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,222
        Hey,
great-looking jacket.

571
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,473
    Oh, you like
    this jacket?

572
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,891
                Oh, yeah.

573
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,343
        Actually, and Eileen,
        you can tell me
        if I'm wrong,

574
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:53,180
      I think it looks better
      on him than it does on me.

575
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:55,732
        You know, you're
        gonna get tons
        of use outta this thing.

576
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,350
                I wear mine
                all the time.

577
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:59,352
                You know what
                I really like?

578
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,521
        It fits really nicely
        across the back on you.

579
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:04,024
        Why don't you
        have a look in
        the three-way mirror?

580
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,859
It's a nice garment.

581
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,445
Listen, Eileen,
I'm gonna go
on my dinner break.

582
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,363
I thought maybe
you'd like to come along.

583
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:12,032
It's on me.
We can spend a little time...

584
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,034
    Harry, man, you hassling
        my woman again?

585
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,821
Maybe some other time.

586
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,625
You gonna buy something?
                No.

587
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:22,992
              Hi.

588
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,215
    Are you gonna buy that?

589
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:29,466
          What?

590
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,667
I think it's too short.

591
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,804
Think so?
          Yeah.

592
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,860
Yeah, I gotta agree with him.
This does not work.

593
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:41,695
    I don't think so.

594
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:43,847
Definitely not.

595
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,204
    Eileen...

596
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:53,707
            Why do you do
            this to me?

597
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,709
                Eileen, I was
                trying to help.

598
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,377
        I told you
        not to come here

599
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,545
    when I'm trying to work.

600
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,679
         Here you are.

601
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,884
      Why are you smiling?

602
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,535
            Because I love you.

603
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:09,222
You are a mess.

604
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:11,641
        You never think
        you're good enough
        for the one you love.

605
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,560
But you aren't
good enough.

606
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:20,049
Aren't you gonna
say something?

607
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,320
        It's go time,
        right now, you and me.

608
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,088
            Go back
            to Alexander High

609
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,690
            and instead
            of being my woman,

610
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,241
                you be my wife.

611
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,410
      What?!

612
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,863
             Eileen, I want you
                to marry me.

613
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,084
Absolutely not.

614
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,787
    I just wanna get engaged.

615
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:42,672
        No!

616
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,379
            It's casual.

617
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,821
    What time did your flight
    get in last night?

618
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:17,490
                Mm, really late.
                I'm exhausted.

619
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,356
                 Have you talked
                 to Ron yet?

620
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,758
Yes, I talked
to Ron.

621
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,426
I told him
he could go jerk off,

622
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,845
but I thought his hand
would reject the merchandise.

623
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,347
                    You did not.

624
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:43,350
Of course I did.
I can talk to him
any way I want.

625
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,107
        Ladies.

626
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,978
         Hello.

627
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,448
    Hi.

628
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,367
I'm Bill Conrad.

629
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,004
I'm up in Unit 93.

630
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,756
And you are...?

631
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,660
    Not interested.

632
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:14,881
Hey, girls.

633
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:17,183
         BOTH: Hey, Louie.

634
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:27,861
     Well...better get back
            to work.

635
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,575
                Marriage. Hm.

636
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,380
        I'm not getting married
        until I'm at least 35.

637
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:50,717
    I mean, married to some guy
    still in high school?

638
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,968
                      Forget it.

639
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:59,759
No, I am not getting married
until I have my own car,

640
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,978
my own place,

641
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,547
and my own money.

642
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,399
Absolutely.

643
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:09,069
I totally agree.

644
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:13,490
            God, you look great!

645
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,892
David's gonna
lose his mind.

646
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,052
I thought you said
the place was phenomenal.

647
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:43,386
It is phenomenal.

648
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,437
     It's great.

649
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,056
  I'm finally my own boss.

650
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:50,760
             But the problem is
             it's costing more
             than I figured.

651
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,295
         I need money.

652
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,948
What you need
is a big raise.

653
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,283
    You think Park'll
          give me one?

654
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:59,736
    Uh, no.

655
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,621
          What you need
          is a roommate,

656
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:03,773
        a guy who can
        take care of himself,

657
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,776
        stay out of your way
        and pay his own rent.

658
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:10,413
Girls, please keep the ball
in your own alley.

659
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:13,116
Come on, getting
a roommate kills
the whole idea

660
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,951
of living by yourself.

661
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,754
            Maybe you're just
            not ready yet.

662
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,473
            My cousin's 33,
            and he still
            lives at home.

663
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,475
Maybe a roommate
isn't such a bad idea.

664
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,811
            There you go.

665
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,647
        I know who.

666
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,015
        Ronnie Silverman.

667
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:31,101
The guy idolized me
in high school,

668
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,986
his parents are rich.
It's perfect.

669
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:35,321
     No, no. Ronnie Silverman
        got a scholarship.

670
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:36,806
     He moved away last weekend.

671
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,307
              Really?

672
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,609
                Fuck, yeah.

673
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,796
    Huh. He didn't even
    call me up.

674
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,784
            You need
            a roommate, Bill.

675
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:56,376
        I got it.

676
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,994
        John Simms.

677
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,599
        Bill, man, John Simms
        moved to San Francisco.

678
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,333
            He's a fag now.

679
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,387
( Clears throat )

680
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,441
                Think.

681
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:16,813
Well, Tommy,

682
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,182
would you like
to be my roommate?

683
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,167
            I thought
            you'd never ask.

684
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,956
          Bill, it'd be an honor
          to be your roommate.

685
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,978
    ( Siren blaring )

686
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,509
            BILL: See, it's not
            totally great yet,

687
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:03,726
            but it's
            almost there.

688
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,495
Are you kidding?
It's fantastic!

689
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:06,946
            It is a nice spread.

690
00:41:06,948 --> 00:41:08,865
It's the best place
I've ever lived in.

691
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,566
                Are you sure
                you can afford
                this, Tom?

692
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,452
        My dad'll pay half.

693
00:41:12,454 --> 00:41:13,703
Good.

694
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,622
        He'll be glad to have me
        outta the house.

695
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:18,574
            We're gonna party
            every night.

696
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,326
Oh, no, Tom.

697
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:23,630
Contrary to popular opinion,
I'm not on summer vacation.

698
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:25,899
It was hard
to get into this place,

699
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,717
and I wanna
stay here.

700
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,552
So what we have to do

701
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,222
is we have to lay down
some ground rules.

702
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,925
Fantastic shower!

703
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,644
                Tom, can you
                come out here

704
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:39,595
                so we can talk,
                please?

705
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,097
            See, the thing is,

706
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,950
            a lot of doctors
            live at this end
            of the complex,

707
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:46,569
        so we have to be quiet
        if we wanna stay here.

708
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:47,987
          Okay.

709
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:51,324
Fantastic microwave, Bill!
This is great, man.

710
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:54,544
        Did you hear about that
        lady who put a poodle
        in the microwave?

711
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,912
                It blew up.

712
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,914
                Gotta try that
                sometime.

713
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,083
    What are you doin'?

714
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,785
    Hey, don't go
    through my drawers.

715
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:03,887
    This is my room.

716
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,922
        The big room's mine!

717
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:07,307
No way, Drake.

718
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:08,925
        That's not fair, man!
Absolutely not.

719
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,626
        You're the guy
        who needed a roommate.

720
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,428
        You're the guy
        who needed the bread.

721
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,646
                Yeah.

722
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:15,915
So, let's flip.

723
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,017
                     Okay.

You lose.

726
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,942

        No.

727
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,443
                Come on, two
                out of three.

728
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,661
        No.

729
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:30,413
             I found this place.
             Please?

730
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,148
For you.

731
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,817
Heads.

732
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,319
You lose.

733
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,088
You wanna clear
your stuff outta the room?

734
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,759
        BILL: I can't believe--

735
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:43,960
Hey, Bill.

736
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,845
Conrad, wait a minute.

737
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:48,715
Listen, I'm gonna
make it up to you.

738
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:52,468
I want you to go
to my stag party tonight.

739
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,141
            Isn't a stag party
            supposed to happen

740
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,642
            right before
            a wedding?

741
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,677
Eileen and I
are engaged.

742
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,448
             Oh.

744
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:16,192
        All Charlie's buddies--

745
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,877
        everyone in his outfit--

746
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:20,696
        he's the only one
        who never got shot.

747
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,833
        He's been on something
        like 20 missions, too.

748
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,052
Charlie must've kicked
some ass in 'Nam.

749
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,887
            Hey, don't say 'Nam.

750
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:29,705
            You call it Vietnam.

751
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,759
            Vets don't like it
            when regular people
            call it 'Nam.

752
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,594
I wanna meet Charlie.

753
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:37,263
            I don't know if he
            wants to meet you.

754
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:39,849
            Charlie's
            a secretive guy.

755
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:42,551
I pass his place
almost every day.

756
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,320
I never see him.

757
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:47,273
            He's not out
            playin' in
            the sprinklers.

758
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:49,108
He's gotta come out
sometime.

759
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,893
            It's not that easy.

760
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,528
            When he came back
            from 'Nam,

761
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,563
            he tried to cash
            a veterans' check.

762
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,833
            Someone spit on him
            in his own bank.

763
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,401
Did he kill the guy?

764
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,703
                It was a girl.

765
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,338
    Shit!

766
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,240
That's cold.

767
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:08,344
    Man, no one gave a damn
    about us back then, Tony.

768
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:06,619
Hey, so what'd Eileen do
when you asked her to marry you?

769
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:11,941
         She went wild.

770
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,943
All right, man!
All right.

771
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:27,039

I'm lookin' for Steve.

                 Hi, Steve.

781
00:46:35,743 --> 00:46:38,027
             You guys got I.D.?

782
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,728
     I'm gonna be straight
        with you.

    night in my life.

        You see, this is
         my stag party.

00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,954
        Aren't you Tom Drake?

787
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:51,240
    Friend of the community.

788
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,125
            Hey, you were great
            in the regionals
            last year.

789
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,243
        Thanks, my man.

790
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:56,712

841
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,326
Look, I told my parents
you were thinkin' about
stoppin' by this week.

842
00:50:14,328 --> 00:50:15,461
          Oh, really?

843
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:17,112
Yeah, like we talked about?

844
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,948
            That might be good.

845
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:25,004
    You look nice
    tonight, David.

846
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:27,006
Got some sun today.

847
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:29,842
                Stop.

848
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,630
            Look... I mean,

849
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,066
            why can't we have
            a regular date?

850
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,984
            Can't we just
            go somewhere?

851
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:41,804
Honey, this is
a regular date.

852
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,406
I work nights.

853
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:01,340
Oh, yeah!

860
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,975
Watch it, sonny.
          Okay, Dad.

a figure made to squeeze ¶

865
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:32,521
Kinda like Anita,
huh, Bill?

866
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,989
( Laughter )

867
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:35,658
            That's not funny.

868
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,042
I thought
it was pretty funny.

00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,612
                I told you
                not to touch

897
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,204
        and some blowtorch fuel.

898

Let's see what
we've got here.

899

This is okay.

Uh-uh.

You know what this is?

902
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:57,016
This is a field bomb.
No way.

903
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:58,550
Sorry, little man.

904
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:00,469
You've gotta be 18
to purchase weaponry.

905
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,804
You know that.

906
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:05,024
    Those are dummy grenades.

907
00:54:05,026 --> 00:54:08,644

an authentic marine
jungle jacket instead?

44th Regiment, Vietnam.

There was no 44th Regiment
          in Vietnam.

00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:17,620
        This jacket is new.

911

You're mistaken.

912
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:21,240
              Look, man,
          my buddy's a vet.

913
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:24,359
          I should take him
              down here

914
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,361
        to see this shit.

00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,363
        This is bullshit.

916
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,300
Please exit the store.

917
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,191
This is the best summer
we ever had.

918
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,085
Quit moping, man.
What's the problem?

919
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:08,003
It's not like
we have prison records.

920
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,404
They let us go.

921
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:15,511
We power partied, Bill.

922

923
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:32,244
Excuse me.

You have to be careful
in this lovely pool area

That was a shoplifter, Tommy.
You let her get away.

        gonna take you places.

That's not true,
that's not true at all.

Do you know where I was
last night? Huh?

00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,741
I was depressed, alone.
I was thinkin' of you.

00:58:25,886 --> 00:58:27,436
Tommy, I think
you'd better leave.

981
00:58:27,438 --> 00:58:29,438
I think you've
bothered Eileen enough.

982
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,390
             He wants me
          to leave, Eileen.

983
00:58:31,392 --> 00:58:32,808
I'm not
kidding, Tommy.

984
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,276
I'm sick
of your act.

985
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,862
Either you leave
or I'm gonna get somebody
to throw you out.

986
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:38,363
                    Okay.

987
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:39,898
    Fine.

988
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,734
            I think you
            better leave, Tommy.

989
00:58:48,741 --> 00:58:50,692
This could be
yours, Eileen.

990
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:56,248
        I thought I told you...

991
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,217
                 You didn't.

992
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:05,540
                It's empty.

993
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,426
I know.

994
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:09,845
But it could
be filled with
a ring for you.

995
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,931
            It's over between
            you and I.

996
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:19,605
      There he is there--
      the guy in the blond hair.

997
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:28,947
Eileen!

998
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:30,899
    Eileen!

999
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,367
This could be you.

1000
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:36,038
Eileen!

1001
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,424
                Eileen!!

1002
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,129
    Good night, Harry.

1003
00:59:44,131 --> 00:59:45,881
Eileen, hang on
for a second.

1004
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,749
I'm just doin'
the sales from today.

1005
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:48,967
You're doing
terrific work.

1006
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:50,969
Sit down.

1007
00:59:50,971 --> 00:59:52,420
I'll tell you--

1008
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,423
you're doing a lot better
than I did when I started here.

1009
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,425
                Well, thanks.

1010
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,280
You know, Eileen.

1011
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:04,700
You know, Eileen,
I gotta tell ya.

1012
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:08,203
I think you're a real
special salesperson,

1013
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,322
I really do.

1014
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:12,941
Sometimes
I think about you

1015
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:17,079
and I wonder what it
would be like to have you.

1016
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,797
                Oh, no.

1017
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,615
I'm not kidding, Eileen.
I'm crazy about you.

1018
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,384
I think about you
all the time.

1019
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:23,919
I really do,
constantly.

1020
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,754
                I don't
            think so, Harry.

1021
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,223
Look, there's
a place we can go here
in home furnishings.

1022
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,391
It's totally secluded.

1023
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,976
Nobody will know
we're there.

1024
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:33,128
        No, Harry, I don't
        think of you that way.

1025
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,315
I turned you off.

1026
01:00:36,317 --> 01:00:39,851
            No... not really.

1027
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:42,187
             I like you.
    I like working with you.

1028
01:00:42,189 --> 01:00:45,524
No, I turned you off.
I know when I turn
somebody off.

1029
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:46,775
I turned you off.

1030
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:48,994
        I think I better go.

1031
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,479
             I'll just go.

1032
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,814
Is it my hair?

1033
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,118
        It's not your hair.

1034
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,953
        Good night, Harry.

1035
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:03,041
( Hard, crunchy sound )

1036
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:08,597
        I broke up with Tommy
        in front of 50 shoppers.

1037
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:10,349
    ( Sighs )

1038
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:13,185
At least with Tommy,
you know where you stand.

1039
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,556
David-- I can't
depend on him.

1040
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,859
Sometimes he shows up.

1041
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:24,396
Most of the time,
he doesn't.

1042
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,501
I think he just comes by
when he's horny.

1043
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:36,024
    You just can't let men
    take advantage of you.

1044
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,327
    Have you tried calling him?

1045
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,499
          I wanted to.

1046
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,255
But he told me
I should be discreet.

1047
01:01:50,257 --> 01:01:51,506
            Discreet?!

1048
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,676
            Discreet... that's
            for other people.

1049
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,311
                    Not you.

1050
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:57,712
      I know.

1051
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,736
                Well, the lights
                are on, Anita.

1052
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:10,075
Maybe his roommate
Rick's there, huh?

1053
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:17,165
            I think I'm
            gonna stay here
            in the car, okay?

1054
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:32,514
    ( Rings doorbell )

1055
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,670
Can I help you?

1056
01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:43,175
            Hi. Is David here?

1057
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,193
He's out on patrol.

1058
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:47,813
            What about Rick?
            Is Rick here?

1059
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:49,147
This is Rick.

1060
01:02:49,149 --> 01:02:50,899
         Hi.

1061
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:55,737
Are you sure
you don't want to write
a note or something?

1062
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,107
                No.

1063
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,464
    I'm sorry if I bothered you.

1064
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:08,667
That's all right.

1065
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,053
                  Bye.

1066
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,056
     Bye.

1067
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,686
            I know how you feel.

1068
01:03:27,688 --> 01:03:31,806
I can't believe
I let him lie
to me like that.

1069
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:37,362
        I have this poem
        that I've saved
        for a really long time,

1070
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:39,865
     and...it used to mean
          a lot to me.

1071
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:43,484
        I'll read it to you
        if you promise
        you won't laugh.

1072
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:47,322
    Ugh...

1073
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:51,426
    "If you love something,
        let it go.

1074
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:55,330
"If it comes back to you,
          it's yours.

1075
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,850
         If it doesn't,
         it never was."

1076
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,670
That sucks, Eileen.

1077
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,272
        Yeah, you're right.

1078
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,008
        I guess I haven't
        read it for a while.

01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,116
Well, yeah, but it
hasn't even been a week,

1119
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,302
and I've had partying
up to my ass.

1120
01:05:57,304 --> 01:05:58,786
    Why so tense?

1121
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,221
            Listen, when
            is the last time

1122
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,257
            you've experienced
            the pleasure
            of a woman?

1123
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,009
None of your business.

1124
01:06:04,011 --> 01:06:07,628
    Hey, dude,
    you can tell us.

1125
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,850
Okay, I'm not
the one goin' out with
high school girls. He is.

1126
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:19,024
Listen, I'm going
into my room.

1127
01:06:19,026 --> 01:06:20,308
When I come out,

1128
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,577
I want some of my food
back in the refrigerator,

1129
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,579
some of this trash
picked up off the floor,

1130
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,648
and can you put
some of my albums back
in their covers, please?

1131
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,867
                Okay.

1132
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:30,919
    Okay?
              Okay, I will.

1133
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:35,323
    I promise, Bill, I will.

1134
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:38,009
        Thank you.

1135
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,683
            BILL: Who are you?!

1136
01:06:44,685 --> 01:06:46,968
GUY: Tommy said
it was okay.

1137
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,803
                It's not okay!
                Get out!

1138
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,805
                    Tommy said
                    it was okay.

1139
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,857
                Stay loose, Tom.
         Later.

1140
01:06:57,897 --> 01:06:59,347
( Knocking on door )

1141
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,681
            Come in.

1142
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,821
        Oh, yeah,
        Unit 87, right?

1143
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,856
    Ninety-three.

1144
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:13,661
            Craig, you guys
            got my check, right?

1145
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,631
Oh, he's here...

1146
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:19,367
Yes, yes, we did.
Bill, right?

1147
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,635
Yes, we did.

1148
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:26,725
Uh... you've got another fella
living there with you, right?

1149
01:07:26,727 --> 01:07:29,811
Yeah, we're splitting the rent.
     Works out pretty good.

1150
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,997
He's loud, isn't he?

1151
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:37,102
        Well, I can talk to him
            about that.

1152
01:07:37,104 --> 01:07:38,386
            He listens to me.

1153
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,488
You see, you better
look at your lease.

1154
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,607
We got another rate
for two people.

1155
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:44,993
        Wow. See, I didn't want
            a place that big

1156
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:45,994
            to begin with.

1157
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:47,112
            You knew that.

1158
01:07:47,114 --> 01:07:49,197
Now look, Bill,

1159
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,116
we provide
a service here.

1160
01:07:51,118 --> 01:07:53,168
Either you pay for it
or you leave.

1161
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,069
And if you leave,
we keep the deposit.

1162
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,337
( Clears throat )

1163
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,206
State rule,
not mine.

1164
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,243
        Well, that's bullshit.

1165
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:06,598
        Listen, I like it here,
        and I wanna stay here.

1166
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,801
  I've put up with every deposit
        and every increase

1167
01:08:09,803 --> 01:08:11,219
    because I wanna stay here.

1168
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:14,105
        But I will not pay
          another cent.

1169
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:16,274
Don't get carried away.

1170
01:08:16,276 --> 01:08:18,610
I'll talk to the owners
about it, huh?

1171
01:08:18,612 --> 01:08:19,727
All right?

1172
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:20,945
But do me a favor.

1173
01:08:20,947 --> 01:08:23,931
Tell that kid to keep
it down, and, hey,

1174
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,733
no parties, all right?

1175
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,654
                No problem.

1176
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,377
( Radio blaring )

1177
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:38,746
GUY: Come on, Brenda,
let's go back to my place.

1178
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,299
BRENDA: I don't wanna go now.
All my friends are inside.

1179
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:42,801
Forget your friends.

1180
01:08:42,803 --> 01:08:44,752
            Well, then I have
            to go home.

1181
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:47,555
Don't worry.
I'll get you home.

1182
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:48,956
Get in the car.

1183
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,225
        I don't wanna go now.

1184
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:51,959
I said get in the car.

1185
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:13,414
Hey, it's that
army kid again.

1186
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,582
    Oh, my God.

1187
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:15,983
                I'm gonna run
                his ass over.

1188
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,151
    Eddie, don't!
                     Shut up!

1189
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:24,659
Grow up, pinhead.
Nobody likes you!

1190
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,465
Was she laughing?

1191
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:31,683
                No.

Fashion Dynasty.
This is Eileen speaking.
Can I help you?

1194
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,026
              Hi, baby, it's me.

1195
01:09:42,028 --> 01:09:43,862
  Oh, it's you.
             <i>Don't hang up.</i>

                I just wanna
                see you tonight.

1197
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,981
That's impossible.

1198
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,199
Look at you.

1199
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:50,652
 <i>You're never gonna change.</i>

1200
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:51,653
                     Why change?

1201
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,071
                  Eileen, I just
                  wanna see you.

1202
01:09:53,073 --> 01:09:55,022
I'm busy.

1203
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,691
And don't try
coming by
the department store.

1204
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,042
You're barred.

1205
01:09:58,044 --> 01:10:01,212
        Eileen, you're leaving
        me no alternative

1208
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:06,701
            All right. Good-bye.

1209
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,037
I'm goin'
to the coffee shop.

You want anything,
love god?

1211

                    It's casual.

01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,766
                    Hey, Robin.
    Hi, Bill.

1215
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:24,068
            Can you make me
            a grilled cheese
            and tomato sandwich?

1216
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,354
Oh, I suppose
I could do that.

1217
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:28,556
        Thank you.
        How's your boyfriend?

1218
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,392
          He's okay...
    as boyfriends go.

1219
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:35,280
I would not know
what to do in
a situation like that.

1220
01:10:35,282 --> 01:10:36,781
This is what you do:

1221
01:10:36,783 --> 01:10:39,167
you clean it up,
you pull your pants up,

1222
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:40,952
you say,
thank you, ma'am,

1223
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,587
and then
you bust her old man.

( Cops laughing)

1225

Where's David?
He's supposed to be here.

1226
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,545
    You know
    where he's at.

1227
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:54,015
    He's up fuckin'
    that skinny little girl
    at Donut City.

1228
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,916
    He likes 'em
    in uniform.

1229
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,519
Well, he is
from Sacramento.

1230
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:01,472
    I wonder if he's
    got anything left
    for his wife?

1231
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:03,191
            Give her
            a nice handshake.

        I'll have it drilled
        for you in 20 minutes.

1234
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,400
Okay.
Thank you, Tommy.

                doin', Conrad?

1238

This is our bread
and butter.

1244

You can't walk out
on a league night.

1245
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,006
                Okay.

1246
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:36,257
            I'll be back later.

1247
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:37,809

            of things.

I am sorry, Park, man.
I got plans.

01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:13,177
    Want some coffee?

1253
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:39,037
So, uh... ( Clears throat )

1254
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:40,738
What's fresh, huh?

1255

It was a joke.

1256
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,697
All right, look,
I know I'm late.

1257
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,500
I got hung up
with a four-car
over on Lakewood.

1258
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,137
            Are you married?

1259
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:00,258
Ha! What, are you
kiddin' me?!

1260
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,428
        I went to your house.

1261
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,217
Why did you do that?

1262
01:13:15,056 --> 01:13:17,575
        Because I missed you.

1263
01:13:21,113 --> 01:13:23,030
Well, that's great.

1264
01:13:25,451 --> 01:13:26,834
That's superb.

1265
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:31,456
 Look, I didn't mess things up
            for you.

1266
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:37,462
You didn't have
to go to my house.

1267
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,550
You had your fun.

1268
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,948
        DAVID: 91 Baker, 10-8.

1269
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,906
I wanna talk to you.

1270
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:06,657
        What's the problem, son?

1271
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:09,327
Get out of your car.
Let's talk about it
like a man.

1272
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:18,085
        I'm gonna arrest you
        like a man if you
        don't shut your mouth.

1273
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:19,387
Oh, big man.

1274
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:21,455
Foolin' around
with a high school girl.

1275
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,123
 I could have
 <i>you</i> arrested.

1276
01:14:24,977 --> 01:14:26,644
        Like I said, shut up.

1277
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:28,095
      Get the hell outta here...

1278
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:31,015
You can do
better than that

1279
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:33,100
for your little
girlfriend, can't you, son?

1280
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:36,020
            Listen, I don't know
            your girlfriend.

1281
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:37,188
                    You hear me?

1282
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,305
Fuck you!

1283
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,951
                  ( Car starts )

1284
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:56,123
      ( Tires screeching )

1285
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:05,499
    ( Loud popping sounds )

1286
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,218
             Shit!

1287
01:15:10,222 --> 01:15:12,523
    ( Siren blares briefly,
          then dies )

1288
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,363
                Shit!

1289
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:31,542
            I think he's asleep.

1290
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:33,578
    Knock.

1291
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,663
          ( Knocking )

1292
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,335
Um, Charlie, I brought
a friend of mine
to meet you.

1293
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,054
I don't wanna bother
you or anything,

1294
01:15:43,056 --> 01:15:45,640
so if it's a hassle,
we can come back.

1295
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:48,142
        No. Come on in.

1296
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,598
Tony, Charlie.

1297
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,316
                  How you doin'?
    Hi.

1298
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:03,324
            You got a new TV.
            Bitchin'!

1299
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:05,243
    Yeah.

1300
01:16:05,245 --> 01:16:07,445
Some new ink, too.

1301
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:10,915
You don't wanna
touch it.

1302
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,095
            Charlie was
            at Khe Sanh, man.

1303
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:27,247
            The 77-day siege.

1304
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,717
            The V.C. buildup
            was so extreme,

1305
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:31,352
            no one thought
            they'd make it.

1306
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:32,586
            Right, Charlie?

1307
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,223
    That's right.

1308
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:41,979
        They shot at 'em
 for, like, 26 hours straight.

1309
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:43,814
        Never got hit though.

1310
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:47,652
      Isn't that right, Charlie?

1311
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:54,542
Jim, you probably know
everything there is
to know about Vietnam.

1312
01:16:54,544 --> 01:16:58,162
 Yeah, except what it was like
          to be there.

1313
01:16:58,164 --> 01:17:01,382
Except what it was
like to be there...

1314
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:04,118
and you're lucky
about that, man.

1315
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,005
You know, you better
get somethin' straight.

1316
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:11,842
I do not want
to go back there.

1317
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:14,428
You keep thinkin' like that,

1318
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:19,567
you're gonna end up in
El Salvador or Nicaragua, man,

1319
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:23,137
and you won't be watchin'
Hueys and goin' "bitchin'."

1320
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,997
I've gotta go
to the bathroom.

1321
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:42,123
    You guys wanna drink a beer,
    there's some in the icebox.

1322
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,827
            Thanks.

1323
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,047
        Let's go.

1324
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:55,553
Charlie?

1325
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:58,856
We're gonna
head out, Charlie.

1326
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,026
Charlie?

1327
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:10,201
Charlie, we're gonna go now.

1328
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:11,952
                      Hey, okay.

1329
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:14,205
             Come back sometime.

1330
01:18:14,207 --> 01:18:15,740
          And bring your friend.

1331
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,299
He was cool!

1332
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:28,419
Everything about
his place was cool!

1333
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:29,720
    Wow!

1334
01:18:29,722 --> 01:18:31,972
I should've said
something.

1335
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:33,808
I blew it.

1336
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:36,844
              No. He liked you.

1337
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,396
            I could tell.

1338
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:45,403
     ( Loud music playing )

1339
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:02,336
This is where I live.

1340
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,507
                Looks expensive.

1341
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:08,742
A lot of doctors
live here.

1342
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,044
    Yeah?

1343
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,462
            It's pretty quiet,
            though,

1344
01:19:11,464 --> 01:19:13,264
        especially over
        on the northern corner.

1345
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:16,884
    ( Loud music continues )

1346
01:19:22,774 --> 01:19:24,775
                    Wow!

1347
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:26,610
Yeah, it's nice.

1348
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,564
            Bill,
            thanks for, uh...

1349
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:32,099
            stickin' up
            for me tonight.

1350
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,651
            It's really great.

1351
01:19:33,653 --> 01:19:35,435
The guy pissed me off.

1352
01:19:38,824 --> 01:19:41,292
Well, maybe now
is a good time for us

1353
01:19:41,294 --> 01:19:43,544
to try and get
back together.

1354
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:45,279
  Huh?

1355
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:46,464
                     Yeah.

1356
01:19:46,466 --> 01:19:48,949
        But on a trial basis,
        because...

1357
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,584
Oh, yeah.
That's what I meant.

1358
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:51,952
Absolutely.

1359
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,587
Because then
we can be

1360
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:56,257
completely independent
yet together...

1361
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:57,725
                    Excuse me.

1362
01:19:57,727 --> 01:19:59,894
Pardon us.

1363
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:06,183
Can't wait
to show you
my apartment.

1364
01:20:06,185 --> 01:20:07,935
It's great.

1365
01:20:07,937 --> 01:20:09,820
We can be alone.

1366
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:14,474
     ( Loud music playing )

1367
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,533
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1368
01:20:22,535 --> 01:20:23,817
             Anything.

1369
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,036
Are you a virgin?

1370
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,873
                    Do you hear
                    something?

1371
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,509
Yeah. Sounds
like music.

1372
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,163
                Look, you don't
                live here.

1373
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,766
        We live here and we're
        trying to concentrate.

1374
01:20:38,768 --> 01:20:41,352
                Please turn
                the music down!

1375
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:48,976
            Hey, what is this?

1376
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,729
Hey, man, this guy
Billy Conrad's
having a party.

1377
01:20:51,731 --> 01:20:53,147
It's great.

1378
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:54,231
                 Tommy!

1379
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:00,404
             Tommy?

1380
01:21:01,873 --> 01:21:05,125
    You throw a great party;
     just not enough room.

1381
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:06,526
Great party.
                    Thanks.

1382
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,579
          We gotta get
    these people outta here.

1383
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:10,080
I'm gonna get thrown out.

1384
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:11,799
             Tommy!

1385
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,721
        ( growling )

1386
01:21:17,723 --> 01:21:19,423
                      Hey, Mack!

1387
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:22,927
          Mack...have you
            seen Tommy?

1388
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:27,264
I think he's
in the laundry room.

1389
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:30,851
By the way, Chief, dude, man,
you throw a great party.

1390
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,988
But I think you need
a bigger pad.

1391
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,865
                    No! No!
                    Vincent, no!

1392
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:47,585
            You're not puttin'
            a poodle in
            the microwave.

1393
01:21:47,587 --> 01:21:49,420
         I just wanted
      to dry him out, man.

1394
01:21:49,422 --> 01:21:52,623
            Where's Tommy?

1395
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:56,126
            You're lookin'
            really foxy, Penny.

1396
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:58,912
Tommy, I didn't even
think you knew me.

1397
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,598
                    I know you.
                    I do.

1398
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,419
Listen, I like you,
but I don't think so.

1399
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,554
                What's wrong?

1400
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:08,939
I just think
you'd tell everybody.

1401
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:11,942
                    Penny, me?

1402
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:17,147
        Do you know
        how that makes me feel,

1403
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:20,150
        girl as beautiful as you
        sayin' that to me?

1404
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:21,652
            That really
            hurts me, Penny.

1405
01:22:21,654 --> 01:22:24,488
I never knew
you were so sensitive.

1406
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,240
                Well, I am.

1407
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,278
Tommy, listen,
don't you have
a girlfriend?

1408
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,547
                She doesn't
                like me anymore.

1409
01:22:33,549 --> 01:22:34,965
I'm sorry.

1410
01:22:34,967 --> 01:22:37,284
I'm gonna go
back out to the party.

1411
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:42,289
I think you invited
too many people.

1412
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,761
                        Hi! Oh!

1413
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:49,763
        Bill, man!
          Anita!

1414
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:52,399
            Tom, where have
            you been?

1415
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,135
            You really fucked up
            this time, Tom.

1416
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,687
             We're doomed.

1417
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:58,489
It's not my fault, man.

1418
01:22:58,491 --> 01:23:01,241
I just invited a few people.
Look what happened.

1419
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:02,660
                    Doomed.

1420
01:23:02,662 --> 01:23:04,194
Hey, face it.
We're popular guys.

1421
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:05,812
      ( bottles breaking )

1422
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,147
            Oh, God.

1423
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,699
See, everybody's
enjoying themselves, buddy.

1424
01:23:08,701 --> 01:23:12,002
            Tom, they are going
            to throw us out!

1425
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:15,339
Anita, you are
lookin' really foxy.

1426
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:18,008
        Thanks. Where's Eileen?

1427
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,760
She doesn't like me
anymore.

1428
01:23:19,762 --> 01:23:21,595
    Tom, have the cops come yet?

1429
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:22,996
        What about Craig Davis?

1430
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,215
This is America, Bill.

1431
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,351
We pay, we stay,

1432
01:23:27,353 --> 01:23:29,019
and they can't do
anything about it,

1433
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:31,105
so I want you
to live it up, stud man.

1434
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:32,723
This is
the last summer blast.

1435
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,393
                     NICK: Tom!

1436
01:23:36,395 --> 01:23:38,345
    Nick!

1437
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,868
Tommy, Tommy!

1438
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:47,538
                 Tommy, I got me
                 a woman!

1439
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,356
            I got me a woman!

1440
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,709
I know a place
that's a little
more private.

1441
01:23:51,711 --> 01:23:54,411
You lose.
Take it off.

1442
01:23:54,413 --> 01:23:57,531
        Come on, Frank.
     Come on. Get 'em off.

1443
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,083
                All right.

1444
01:23:59,085 --> 01:24:00,634
All the way!

1445
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:05,389
     ( Cheering, clapping )

1446
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:08,008
            Hey! Hey, Tommy!

1447
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,393
            We're gonna split.

1448
01:24:09,395 --> 01:24:11,345
            There's no room
            to dance in here.

1449
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:13,230
    No, you can't split.
    No, don't split.

1450
01:24:13,232 --> 01:24:14,381
    There's plenty
    of room here.

1451
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,100
    What are you
    talkin' about?

1452
01:24:16,102 --> 01:24:18,051
    There's room here.
    There's room.

1453
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,070
    We'll make room.
    Back it up.

1454
01:24:20,072 --> 01:24:23,190
    Back it up,
    back it up!

1455
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,525
    Move outta the way!

1456
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:30,080
    What am I talkin' about?
We got a dance floor next door.

1457
01:24:34,252 --> 01:24:36,703
    ( Glass shatters )

1458
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,579
        We can do it again.

1459
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,131
        One more time!
        Come on.

1460
01:24:47,133 --> 01:24:49,516
That was
only practice.

1461
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:52,102
    We're gonna get it
        this time.

1462
01:25:33,794 --> 01:25:35,128
          Thomas! Thomas Drake!

1463
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,514
     Dad?

1464
01:25:37,516 --> 01:25:40,634
            You're comin' home
            with me right now!
    Dad!

1465
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,320
        Don't you ever stay away
        all night like that.

1466
01:25:43,322 --> 01:25:45,606
        Your mother's
        worried sick about you,
        for Christ's sake!

1467
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:47,174
Dad, I'm sorry.

1468
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:49,142
        Come on!
        Get out.

1469
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,478
Bill, I'm sorry, man.
I forgot to tell my dad
I got my own place.

1470
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,996
                    It's casual.

1471
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:54,331
Don't you ever...

1472
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:57,251
don't you ever stay away
all night like that.

1473
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:59,086
        Follow me.

1474
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:00,454
                  Oh!

1475
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:09,907
            Oh!

1476
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:13,277
            Holy mother!

1477
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,367
             Anybody hurt?

1478
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,008
            That's too bad.

1479
01:27:33,298 --> 01:27:34,932
            Lawsuit.

1480
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,587
                    Oh, God!

1481
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:47,561
Wanna start
with the kitchen?

1482
01:27:53,934 --> 01:27:56,119
Ya know, somehow
I had the feeling

1483
01:27:56,121 --> 01:27:58,155
that things were gonna
end up like this...

1484
01:27:58,157 --> 01:28:00,157
just not so soon.

1485
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,793
        Conrad, do you realize
        what went on in there
        last night?

1486
01:28:02,795 --> 01:28:04,044
    Yes.

1487
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:05,945
        We had a major blowout.

1488
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,332
Well, so what?

1489
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:10,467
I mean, look where
it got us.

1490
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,589
If you ask
any one of those people
ten years from now

1491
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:18,008
what the highlight
of this year was,

1492
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:20,427
they'd have to say
Bill Conrad's party.

1493
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:23,096
We gave them
the best time
they've ever had.

1494
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:25,482
                    So what?

1495
01:28:25,484 --> 01:28:27,684
Don't you realize
what you've done?

1496
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:29,770
                     What?

1497
01:28:29,772 --> 01:28:32,639
You've made
the transformation, buddy,

1498
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,109
from average guy
to the Bill Man.

1499
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,663
You're a legend.

1500
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,451
            No, no, no, no, no.

1501
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:46,019
                    Tom...

1502
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,129
Later.

1503
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:47,931
Eileen.

1504
01:29:47,933 --> 01:29:49,399
How you doin'?

1505
01:29:53,604 --> 01:29:55,772
Will you look at me?

1506
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,755
I've changed, Eileen.

1507
01:30:11,757 --> 01:30:13,623
                I heard about
                the other night.

1508
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,426
That wasn't me, Eileen.
That was another guy
altogether.

1509
01:30:16,428 --> 01:30:19,096
         Tommy, you're immature.

1510
01:30:19,098 --> 01:30:22,349
Listen, I really
care about you.

1511
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:25,752
Just give me
another chance.

1512
01:30:27,105 --> 01:30:29,022
        Another chance for what?

1513
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,273
For a relationship.

1514
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:37,781
Come on. I'll give you
a ride to History.

1515
01:30:40,818 --> 01:30:42,819
I can be a gentleman.

1516
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:54,798
    I'll see ya later, Tommy.

1517
01:30:58,836 --> 01:31:01,004
              Aah!

1518
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,276
        Bill Man!

1519
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:26,880
Can I, uh,
call you at home?

1520
01:31:26,882 --> 01:31:28,999
                Are you kidding?

1521
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:31,835
    I'm gonna have a new place
        by this afternoon.

1522
01:31:31,837 --> 01:31:33,152
      Great!

1523
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:34,504
When's the first party?

1524
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,292
Just you and me.

1525
01:31:50,354 --> 01:31:53,023
This year's gonna
be so excellent!

1526
01:31:53,025 --> 01:31:56,059
     Hey, when we hang out
        this year,

1527
01:31:56,061 --> 01:31:57,360
    you gotta stop
    saying "excellent."

1528
01:31:57,362 --> 01:31:58,645
                  Oh, I'm sorry.

1529
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:03,349
         It's my fault.

1530
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:08,288
            Thanks for getting
            my books.

1531
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,240
            I'm so clumsy,
            I can't believe it.

1532
01:32:10,242 --> 01:32:12,525
It's all right.

1533
01:32:14,879 --> 01:32:18,197
          Maybe I'll see you
            later... Jim.

1534
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:20,000
    Yeah.
