1
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,254
<i>How the hell did I get up here?</i>

2
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,218
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

3
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:45,053
<i>Just four weeks ago,</i>
<i>I was a completely different person.</i>

4
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,062
<i>I had no adventure in my life.</i>

5
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>I had a wife.</i>

6
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,891
<i>I had a family.</i>

7
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,238
<i>And I never looked twice</i>
<i>when a pretty girl walked by.</i>

8
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,767
<i>Never.</i>

9
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,129
- Four, please.
- Me, too.

10
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,326
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm looking<i>...</i> What's that?

11
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,096
It's the air conditioner.
It'll come on in a second.

12
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,169
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

13
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,939
I beg your pardon!

14
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,805
I'm losing my briefcase.

15
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,487
I don't know.

16
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,423
No, I've never tried it that way before.

17
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,654
No, I'm not worried.

18
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,697
It's just that I've never tried it
in that position before.

19
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,026
It's all new to me.

20
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,094
Well, I know you have to wet it
before you put it in.

21
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,036
You have to, or it could break off.

22
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,506
How far? I don't know how far.

23
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,437
All the way, I suppose.

24
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,708
I know you have to keep wiggling it
to get all the hairs off it.

25
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,149
All right!

26
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,482
Put that phone down.

27
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,379
I can't talk to you now. I'll call you back later.

28
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,425
Do you have to talk like that at work?

29
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,188
Can't you save that filthy stuff
until you get home?

30
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,526
That was my brother.

31
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,229
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

32
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,929
He and I are trying to set up
a photo-processing lab at my place.

33
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,233
That way I can take stuff home. For example...

34
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,671
All right!

35
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,373
- Where's the figures on the cable-car campaign?
- It's on the third floor...

36
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,574
Get them for me right away!
We've wasted enough time on this.

37
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,911
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,318
I spent two months on that.

39
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,357
- I want you to roll down the map and show me.
- All right.

40
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,552
Okay.

41
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,893
Hello?

42
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,435
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

43
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,599
What?

44
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,538
<i>La Primavera, in North Beach.</i>

45
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,409
<i>Tonight.</i>

46
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,245
I know who you are.

47
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,417
9:00?

48
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,953
Why?

49
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,657
Just because.

50
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,527
I can't make it at...

51
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,864
...9:00.

52
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,071
Say, 9:10?

53
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,141
<i>Yes.</i>

54
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,931
Why are you speaking to me in German?

55
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,790
Why?

56
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,794
I mean, the modeling agency told me
that you were from Germany.

57
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,066
It's not me.

58
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,573
Well, I'd better check.

59
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,867
Where am I going?

60
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,857
How do I look?

61
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,521
The earrings are too much, aren't they?

62
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,256
Here, you keep 'em for me, honey.

63
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,594
I'll do it. You keep your eyes on the road.

64
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,190
They were killing me, anyway.

65
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,327
Didi, what was I gonna ask you?

66
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,995
I wanted to ask you something.

67
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,568
Would you like to go to the movies tonight?

68
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,041
Tonight's study group.

69
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,336
What do you mean?

70
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,778
What's today? Today's Wednesday?

71
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,106
I thought today was Thursday.

72
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,275
What's the matter with me?

73
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,445
I'd like to go anyway, if it's all right with you.

74
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,387
I can't put up with those crazies tonight.

75
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,325
It's all arranged.
You're taking the girls to the movies.

76
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,659
I promised them you would.
Anyway, you deserve a night out.

77
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,697
So, what do you say?

78
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,330
- What do you mean? Of course. Sure.
- You're wonderful.

79
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,948
Honey.

80
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,187
See you tonight.

81
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,054
Thanks for the lift.

82
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,107
You know, you're cute when you serve.

83
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,607
Go ahead, Teddy. What are you nervous about?
Serve the ball.

84
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,146
Now come on, calm down.
Let the man serve, Buddy.

85
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,979
You got nothing to worry about.
It's only set point. It's not like your life.

86
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,575
It's just your self-respect.

87
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,618
Give him that solid one. Give him the ace.
Teddy, come on!

88
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,554
What is it? Am I talking too much?

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,560
We'll calm down. We'll take it easy.
Teddy wants to serve.

90
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,856
Okay?

91
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,988
You can do it. Put it right in there.

92
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,000
What a serve!

93
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,067
Switch!

94
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,434
Okay, here we go now. You ready?
Get that racquet ready, I'm coming at you.

95
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,370
This baby is mine!

96
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,907
- You hit the net.
- Follow-through.

97
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,909
- You can't!
- On the follow-through!

98
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,003
- You still can't hit the net.
- I hit it on the follow-through.

99
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,981
I hit this ball first, then the net,
on the follow-through.

100
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,848
It's our point. It's 6-2. You're in the shit house.

101
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,888
- Anybody ever tell you you're cute?
- You're cute, too.

102
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,117
- How you doing?
- Okay.

103
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,193
What's the matter, he getting to you?

104
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,329
No.

105
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,364
- So, what's that matter?
- Nothing.

106
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,432
Hey!

107
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,262
Look at that!

108
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,735
Oh, my. That is serious Nautilus.

109
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,198
Miss!

110
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,575
Thank you.

111
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,705
Those are fine-looking racquets
you got there, girls.

112
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,579
What are they, Heads?

113
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,287
Joe, there's a phone call for you.

114
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,552
Do me a favor and take it for me, will you?

115
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,886
I met them on separate nights.
How could I know they're sisters?

116
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,124
- You're in a lot of trouble, Joe.
- No way.

117
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,897
I got a date with the little one at 7:00
and the older one at 9:15. Plenty of time.

118
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,901
What about Theresa?

119
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,307
What about Theresa?

120
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,038
Doesn't she notice anything
when you go with someone for a while?

121
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,311
Like you used to go with that girl before.
Doesn't she think anything's up?

122
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,885
Look.

123
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,387
Theresa's got the kids to worry about.
She's too busy to notice anything.

124
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,788
And they're great kids.

125
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,554
She's 38 years old,
she's a very happily married woman.

126
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,128
You see. She smiles all the time.

127
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,164
- Does she do it?
- Does she do what?

128
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,367
What do you mean, <i>"</i>Does she do what?<i>"</i>

129
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,904
- What do you mean, <i>"</i>Does she do what?<i>"</i>
- Does she does she do it, too?

130
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,473
- Do what, too?
- Does she have affairs, too?

131
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,941
Teddy, you're my friend, and I love you.

132
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,414
You're a sweet, sensitive guy...

133
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,041
...but you're very naive.

134
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,814
To think that my Theresa...

135
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
...would fool around?
- I just asked a question.

136
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,353
Do you believe this man asking
whether my Theresa would fool around?

137
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,726
I find it hard to imagine
your wife sleeping with you.

138
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,030
Teddy.

139
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,032
What am I laughing at?

140
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,105
Are you sure?

141
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,407
All right, I'll let him know. Thank you.

142
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,375
- Are you staying for lunch, Doctor?
- No. Joe!

143
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,088
What else did the neighbor say?

144
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,520
Nothing. She was coming over
to return a warming tray...

145
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,997
...and she ran into the bunch
coming down the steps.

146
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,898
Theresa, the kids, and all the furniture.

147
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,963
There was a big van waiting for them.

148
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,733
What a bitch.

149
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,074
Come on, she was our friend, too.

150
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,840
Wonder if it was her furniture?

151
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,849
- Why do you have to talk about that?
- What should we do, cry?

152
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,079
I just want to know
if she had a right to take all the furniture.

153
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,748
Is it from Theresa?

154
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,724
Found a picture of me with another woman.

155
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,224
Naked?

156
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,156
In a night club.

157
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,301
This isn't happening.

158
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,040
This isn't fucking happening!
It's not happening!

159
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,511
Son of a bitch!

160
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,747
Bitches, fucking whore!

161
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,223
<i>Teddy, what could we do to cheer up Joe?</i>

162
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,800
- Want to do the blind man with me tonight?
- I can't do that.

163
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,393
- You do the blind man with me?
- No, I get nervous.

164
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,698
Joe needs a good laugh.

165
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,205
We'll take him to the place
where they threw him out.

166
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,570
I get too nervous.

167
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,168
Came in with a cardigan.
They wanted him to put on one of their jackets.

168
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,212
- Okay, Michael? Come on.
- No, I get too nervous.

169
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,410
- Are you tied up with Mrs. Schumacher?
- I'm not tied up with her.

170
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,146
- His boss's wife.
- I don't believe it.

171
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,122
I'm telling you. You were away on vacation.
He's banging Dr. Schumacher's wife.

172
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,887
Son-of-a-gun!
Are you making it with Schumacher's wife?

173
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,518
- Only at night.
- If it's an emergency.

174
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,290
- <i>"</i>Only at night?<i>"</i>
- Ask him.

175
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,298
The time it takes me to drive there...

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,801
...is the exact same time it takes him
to scrub and put on his gloves.

177
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,101
If it's not a big job, it's not worth it to me.
If it's appendicitis, I don't go.

178
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,176
But, if it's peritonitis or a gall bladder<i>...</i>

179
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,077
<i>"</i>Hello, honey, good news.
It's a quadruple bypass!<i>"</i>

180
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,846
So, you say like this:

181
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,786
<i>"</i>Is Mr. Pierce there, please?<i>"</i> Very timid.

182
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,915
- <i>"</i>Is Mr. Pierce there, please?<i>"</i>
- That's it, just like that.

183
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,220
Then I'll get on the phone and say, <i>"</i>Hello?<i>"</i>

184
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,992
Then I'm going to wait a few seconds,
like I'm listening to you, and then I'll say:

185
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,691
<i>"</i>What?

186
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,127
<i>"</i>You want me to come out right now?

187
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,137
<i>"</i>Are you sure that you can't handle this
by yourself, Richard?<i>"</i>

188
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,234
- Who's Richard?
- Richard's my assistant.

189
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,275
He works here at the office with me.

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,274
Clear?

191
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,210
Is it a woman?

192
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,777
Is it a woman?

193
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,645
No. It's<i>...</i>

194
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,815
<i>"</i>Is it a woman?<i>"</i>

195
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,989
What goes on in your head?

196
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,258
No, it's just...

197
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,862
...we're planning<i>...</i>

198
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,259
Well, it's too complicated.

199
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,767
But don't tell Didi...

200
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,927
...because it's a wonderful surprise.

201
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,063
- You want me to call you at 8:15?
- 8:15.

202
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,936
It has to be at 8:15 sharp.

203
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,182
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, sweetie pie.

204
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,184
Did Mom tell you about tonight?

205
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,297
- No. Missy, I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry, Daddy, but...

206
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,594
...Shelly didn't get the tickets until 4:00.

207
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,201
I know you really wanted to go to the movie...

208
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,739
...but it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance,
and his uncle had some pull.

209
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,604
- What tickets are you talking about?
- David Bowie.

210
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,911
You mean, you can't go to the movie?

211
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,239
I'm sorry, Daddy. I feel so bad.

212
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,009
No. Don't be silly.

213
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,915
Are you really disappointed?

214
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,155
Well<i>...</i>

215
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,650
No, I mean, I wanted to go, sure, but<i>...</i>

216
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,786
So these things happen.

217
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,296
I understand that.

218
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,025
- You remember Shelly, don't you?
- Of course.

219
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,674
How are you?

220
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,910
How are you?

221
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,637
I'm fine.

222
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,016
I'm fine.

223
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,449
You're a Jewish boy, aren't you?

224
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,019
My mother and father are Jewish.

225
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,923
I see.

226
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,069
- You're taking my little girl to see David Boowie?
- Bowie.

227
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,936
Bowie.

228
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,572
You take care...

229
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,771
...of my girl.

230
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,119
You take care of my girl.

231
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,257
Now, of course,
I'm sure you've heard about the alphabet diet.

232
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,364
Now, that takes 26 weeks.

233
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,066
The first week,
you're allowed anything that begins with an <i>"</i>A<i>."</i>

234
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,696
And, then onto the second week,
you're allowed anything that begins with a <i>"</i>B<i>."</i>

235
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,040
There's only one problem.

236
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,636
You have to watch yourself carefully
because by the time you get to <i>"</i>P<i>"...</i>

237
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,409
...you might put on all the weight
you lost on <i>"</i>K<i>."</i>

238
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,677
Excuse me.

239
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:17,118
And then, when you get to <i>"</i>X,<i>"</i>
it's very difficult...

240
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,916
...because you start making up
your own spelling, like <i>"</i>X- Benedict<i>"...</i>

241
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,755
<i>..."</i>X- tra helpings<i>."</i>

242
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,352
So, I would not recommend that diet.

243
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,031
You go through my pockets now?

244
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,833
No.

245
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,807
Not yet. I owe Marty $10.

246
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,211
I think he likes you.

247
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,002
You think everyone likes me.

248
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,877
- They do.
- Oh, well.

249
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,216
Can I get you anything
before I start my study group?

250
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,453
Oh, God.

251
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,461
What honey? What's the matter?

252
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,760
Nothing. It's not even worth talking about.

253
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,992
What?

254
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,905
I was leaving my office and the boss comes in
with this pile of stuff and two assistants...

255
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,474
...says, <i>"</i>Clean this up for tomorrow morning<i>."</i>

256
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,669
<i>"</i>Clean this up<i>."</i> Now I'm a cleaning man.

257
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,444
- Will it take long?
- Take long? No, not if I work all night.

258
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,984
I'm just so tired, that's all.
I just don't know if I can stay awake.

259
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,484
I'm so tired.

260
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,782
Baby. Here.

261
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,091
I gave half to Richard, but...

262
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,126
...he panics, he gets so nervous.
I don't know if he can handle it.

263
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,261
Baby. Can I fix you a drink?

264
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,295
You know...

265
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,903
...I really think they're taking advantage of me.

266
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,065
- Want Campari and soda?
- Yeah, that would be nice.

267
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,369
Thanks.

268
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,907
You just<i>...</i>

269
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,512
You gotta draw a line and say, <i>"</i>No more.

270
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,178
<i>"</i>You can't go past this line<i>."</i>

271
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,188
Who's staying for dinner?

272
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,020
Honey, why are you shaving?

273
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,024
Why am I shaving?

274
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,136
What the hell is the matter with me?

275
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,867
Did you want this tie out?

276
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,413
No.

277
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,277
What do I want another tie for?

278
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,582
Honey, you're overtired.

279
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,979
I think that you should take a little nap
before you eat.

280
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,690
Come here and sit close to me.

281
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,461
What's this?

282
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,998
What do you mean? This is Joe's little boy.

283
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,700
I know it's Joe's little boy,
but what's he doing here?

284
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,334
S-M-I-L-E.

285
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,469
Where is his...

286
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,979
...M- O-M-M-Y?

287
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,644
She didn't tell me. It's just for one night.

288
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,086
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she didn't.

289
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,018
Don't frighten him.

290
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,220
What a cute little pee-pee.

291
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,891
You leave his little pee-pee alone.

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,901
His Daddy's little pee-pee started all this.

293
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,033
One, two, three. Hit it.

294
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,187
- Hello, gentlemen. How are we tonight?
- Fine, how you feeling, Andy?

295
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,749
How am I feeling? What do you mean?
Why shouldn't I be feeling fine?

296
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,888
No, this nice man
just wanted to know how you were.

297
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:20,965
I'm fabulous!

298
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,500
I've never felt better in my life!

299
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,362
Well, great.

300
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,895
What'll you have?

301
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,132
- What'll you have?
- Southern Comfort with ice.

302
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,401
Make that two.

303
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,942
Okay. You bet.

304
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,443
I'll be right back. I gotta lock my car.

305
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,614
There you are.

306
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,671
Cigarette?

307
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,947
- What was that?
- Nothing, sir. Just setting up your drinks.

308
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,382
- What was that?
- Nothing.

309
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,383
Jake!

310
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,762
- He said he'd be back in just...
- Jake!

311
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,694
He said he'd be back in a minute, Andy.

312
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,927
- How did you know any name?
- Well, your friend called you<i>...</i>

313
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,093
Jake!

314
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,139
Where are you?

315
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,612
What is this?

316
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,845
What are you doing?

317
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,387
What are you doing with me?

318
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,516
What is this?

319
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,421
What the hell is this thing?

320
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,695
What kind of a place is this?

321
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,168
Hey!

322
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,198
- I'm right here, Andy.
- Jake!

323
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,462
I'm right here.

324
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,096
Don't ever leave me again, Jake.

325
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,208
I'm sorry, he can't, he's<i>...</i>

326
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,540
Sorry.

327
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:05,995
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>the time will be 8:09 and 50 seconds.</i>

328
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,612
All right, time to go back to bed.

329
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,313
You don't want your mommy
to be angry with me, do you?

330
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,184
Come here.

331
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,990
I want my mommy.

332
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,105
When you wake up,
your mommy will be here to pick you up.

333
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,751
Night-night.

334
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,152
Is she on a date?

335
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,887
I don't know.
She asked me to keep him for one night.

336
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,963
Well, what about the other kids?

337
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,395
I don't know.

338
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,823
Well, what am I supposed to say to Joe?

339
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,366
Nothing!
Don't you tell that son of a bitch anything!

340
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,032
Come on now. He's our friend.

341
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,700
He's a rat.

342
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,104
I would have left him long before she did.

343
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,179
What is that supposed to mean?

344
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,242
If anything like that ever happened to us...

345
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,455
...I don't know what I would do.

346
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,192
- We better just drop the subject.
- No. Now, wait a minute.

347
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,626
Now we're talking nicely and calmly.

348
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,096
Let's hear what you have to say on the subject.

349
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,325
Teddy<i>...</i>

350
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,863
I know you think you know everything about me,
but you don't.

351
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,370
I'm really a very jealous woman.

352
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,543
I know you think, emotionally, I'm like this, but...

353
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,205
...you know, I really...

354
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,343
...am a little...

355
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,883
...crazy.

356
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,679
But just in some ways.

357
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,720
- Why are you telling me all this?
- You asked me.

358
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,630
I know I asked you,
but you make it sound as if we're not a happily...

359
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,423
What?

360
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,135
What have you got there?

361
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,526
It's a gun.

362
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,267
I know it's a gun,
but when did you ever get a gun?

363
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,775
Well, Mama gave it to me after they moved.

364
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,516
You realize you might have shot me?

365
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,444
I would never do that.

366
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,520
I mean, not without a reason.

367
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,279
You're not like Joe.

368
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,689
Do you know what he did to Theresa,
right in front of me?

369
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,389
He had his secretary call at 10:00 at night...

370
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,261
...and say he had work to do at the office.

371
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,527
- He did that?
- Yes.

372
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,264
You mean, that old trick still works?

373
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,234
Not anymore.

374
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,744
I'll get it.

375
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,039
Hello?

376
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,618
Yes, just a minute. It's Richard.

377
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,485
Hello.

378
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,255
Yes, Richard. How are you?

379
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,457
Yes.

380
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,866
You what?

381
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,500
Is this a joke?

382
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,110
You want me to do what?

383
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,376
Are you crazy?

384
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,343
They said<i>...</i>

385
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,380
They said I should do<i>...</i>

386
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,616
I should do what?

387
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,229
They want me to come out at 10:00 at night...

388
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,661
...and leave my wife and children?

389
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,900
I don't care!
8:15, 10:00, what difference does it make?

390
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,834
I'm not a wind-up toy.

391
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:05,069
You tell my superiors at the office,
who can give me raises and promotions...

392
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:10,045
...that if they don't like my answer,
they can go take it and shove it up their ass.

393
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,845
That's the best joke I've heard all year.

394
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,346
Hey!

395
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,922
Now what's going on?

396
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,525
Hey, fellas, come on now.

397
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,655
Let's just shake hands, we'll go home.

398
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,166
What the hell did you hit him for,
for Christ's sake?

399
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,704
What kind of a fellow are you,
pushes a blind man?

400
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,412
Hello?

401
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,385
Okay. I'll be right over, sweetheart.

402
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,453
Are you sure it's a gallbladder?

403
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,366
You better hurry.
They moved the meeting up 15 minutes.

404
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,771
Why doesn't anybody ever tell me these things?

405
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,043
It's like an oven over there.

406
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,246
Air conditioning must be on the blink again.

407
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,347
What's that?

408
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,744
She's the girl they chose for
the cable-car campaign.

409
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,185
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

410
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,756
- Who is she?
- Ask the boss. He found her.

411
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,953
He goes riding once a week in Golden Gate Park.

412
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,425
Guess what he saw galloping through the fog?

413
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,123
Horseback riding?

414
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,602
Ridden much?

415
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,510
Yes, since I was a little boy.

416
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,345
I used to teach horseback riding
to earn extra money.

417
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,046
- See you later.
- See you later.

418
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,051
Okay! Here we go!

419
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,658
Come on.

420
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,659
Everything okay?

421
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,794
Yes. I have a pebble...

422
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,939
...in my finger, in the glove.

423
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,805
Better to get it out now than when you're...

424
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,509
...tearing along like that, you know.

425
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,312
Okay! Come on, big fella.

426
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,308
Hi-ho, Thunder!

427
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,385
Away!

428
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,248
Everything's okay?

429
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,189
Yeah, I was just wondering
whether I should call my wife<i>...</i>

430
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,491
Hey!

431
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,827
The ride to the left is the prettiest!

432
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:06,266
Yes, I just want to take a look
over here for a second!

433
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,633
<i>I searched all day long...</i>

434
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,405
<i>... but I couldn't find that woman</i>
<i>who was haunting me.</i>

435
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,417
<i>Hello?</i>

436
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,322
How would you like to smoke the peace pipe?

437
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,785
<i>Who is this?</i>

438
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,915
You don't know me?

439
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,694
I had dinner alone at La Primavera.

440
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,526
It's you.

441
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,736
I'm so sorry I wasn't there the other night.

442
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,430
Please, forgive me.

443
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,097
My mother had a heart attack.

444
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,904
I had to spend the night with her in the hospital.

445
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,274
- How is she?
- Better.

446
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,215
She's trotting around.
I mean, she's walking around nicely now, but...

447
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,715
...it was a terribly close call.

448
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,452
Do you know Le Club...

449
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,219
...at the corner of Jones Street and Clay?

450
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,851
Yes.

451
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,898
5:00.

452
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,955
Hi-ho, pal.

453
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,049
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

454
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,694
- Thanks. Catch you later.
- Sure.

455
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,261
Heart.

456
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,405
Family heart!

457
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,960
Help!

458
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,934
Somebody help!

459
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,451
Hello!

460
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,354
Wait!

461
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,762
Don't move!

462
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,470
Move!

463
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,737
Go!

464
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,349
Hello!

465
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,481
Wait!

466
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,224
Hello, there!

467
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,965
Easy, big fella. Easy!

468
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,964
Steady, Thunder!

469
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,309
Steady, boy! Take it easy.
Everything's under control.

470
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,479
You're in no danger whatsoever.

471
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,841
Easy does it.

472
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,107
Don't be nervous.

473
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,341
Hello, there.

474
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,343
Hello.

475
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,611
That's a gorgeous animal you have there.

476
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,712
I'm somewhat of an expert.

477
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,891
That's a superb specimen.

478
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,686
- She's a beauty.
- Yes, he is nice. Thank you.

479
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,785
Wait!

480
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,423
Move!

481
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,501
Go!

482
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,161
Right, Thunder! To the right, Thunder.

483
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,704
To the right!

484
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,545
Hello again.

485
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,615
Mind if I ride along with you for a while?

486
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,176
No. I don't mind.

487
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,048
Fancy meeting you here.

488
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,252
Do you ride very often?

489
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,755
Yes, since I was a boy.

490
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,484
I used to teach riding
in order to earn a little extra money.

491
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,926
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,863
By the way, about the other night.

493
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,061
I wanted to explain.

494
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,762
What other night?

495
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,268
I see.

496
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,341
Excuse me!

497
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,344
All right, you want to play it that way,
it's all right with me. I don't mind.

498
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,238
My riding crop.

499
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,680
That's all right. I'll get it.

500
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,480
Say, <i>"</i>I'm sorry,<i>"</i> Thunder.

501
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,315
Say, <i>"</i>I am sorry<i>."</i>

502
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,322
Thunder is a sweet horse...

503
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,422
...but, boy, is he dumb!

504
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,524
I hate to be too hard on him.

505
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,629
It could kill his spirit, but...

506
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,396
...boy, is he<i>...</i>

507
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,628
You're a silly horse!

508
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,734
He's just a baby, you know.

509
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,206
Here you are.

510
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,576
Thank you.

511
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,344
You're very gallant.

512
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,546
I'm just...

513
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,852
...a romantic, I guess.

514
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,452
Be good this time.

515
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,821
Be good.

516
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,695
Don't embarrass me.

517
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,892
Wait. Whoa, Thunder!

518
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,306
Wait! You dropped something.

519
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,114
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

520
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,995
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Sharon.

521
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,327
- Have a nice night, Mr. Pierce.
- Thank you. Same to you, Richard.

522
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,979
Why, hello!

523
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,020
Hello, yourself.

524
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,089
What a pleasant surprise.

525
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,752
Well, not really.
I just came to give you back your earring.

526
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,657
- What earring?
- I don't know whose it is.

527
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,358
It fell out of your pocket yesterday
when you got off your horse.

528
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,493
I decided to pick it up after you left so quickly.

529
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,269
Well, it's a nice earring, but it's not mine.

530
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,467
What would I be doing with an earring?

531
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,107
So what's new?

532
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,236
I'm gonna be late for my dance class.

533
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,535
No, wait!

534
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,575
How about having dinner with me?

535
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,212
Thank you, but no.

536
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,448
I know of this funny little place.

537
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:24,752
It's a fun little Chinese place,
where you sit down on the floor...

538
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:29,356
...and you can eat with your hands or chopsticks
or anything you want.

539
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,065
For lunch?

540
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:33,336
No, I'm not free for lunch or dinner.

541
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,301
A little snack in-between?

542
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,270
I'd better be going.

543
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:07,035
- What's your name?
- Theodore Pierce. Teddy. Ted.

544
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,801
Tomorrow, 6:00, Tulio's.

545
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,338
- On Columbus?
- Yeah.

546
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,448
How old is that suit?

547
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,948
This? I don't know.

548
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,880
Six, seven, eight years, maybe.

549
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,388
It looks it.

550
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,052
Wait! What's your name?

551
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,593
Charlotte!

552
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,573
Even longer on the pants.

553
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,179
Longer on the pants?

554
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,342
More sleeve.

555
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,179
You want more sleeve than this?

556
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,183
Listen to me! This is what I know!

557
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,448
But, Buddy, are you sure this style suits me?

558
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:03,117
- You want to look good at funerals?
- No, I just want to look nice.

559
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,558
Let me see.

560
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,728
Put your arms down.

561
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,102
Now you're cooking with Crisco!

562
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,938
Robert Redford.

563
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,417
Mr. Dengilihan! Great news!

564
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,892
I just got the figures from Community Affairs.
The cable-car campaign's a smash!

565
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,191
All the TV stations, Channel 5, Channel 3...

566
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,231
...the newspapers, the magazines...

567
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,802
...all they're talking about is
the reopening of the cable cars.

568
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,167
It's unbelievable. You wouldn't believe it.

569
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,005
It's better than our wildest imagination.

570
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:55,101
We couldn't have hoped for a better campaign
than what we've got right now.

571
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,440
It's due to you, sir.

572
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,880
It's a wonderful tribute to the whole concept.

573
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,763
Hey. What it is?

574
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,870
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight, please.
A double room.

575
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,314
Something with a king-size bed, if you have it.

576
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,049
<i>Let me have a look.</i>

577
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,777
<i>We have that available.</i>
<i>Can I have your name, please?</i>

578
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,080
Irving.

579
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,916
Julius...

580
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,549
...Irving.

581
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,148
<i>All right. Could you spell that for me, please?</i>

582
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,921
I-r-v-i<i>...</i>

583
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,058
No, wait a minute!

584
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,156
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

585
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,532
E-r-v-i...

586
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,131
...n- g.

587
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,838
Is there a Theodore Pierce here? Mr. Pierce?

588
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,104
Sorry, nobody here by that name.

589
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,143
Well, nobody's answering.

590
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,474
All right.

591
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,313
Now wait.

592
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,184
Miss Charlotte who?

593
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,656
Wait! Hello! Don't hang up, please.

594
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,727
That's for me. Thank you.

595
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,096
Hello, Charlotte? It's Teddy. Where are you?

596
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,790
<i>I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

597
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,597
In Los Angeles? What are you doing there?

598
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,101
<i>I'm sorry, I'm working.</i>

599
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,900
<i>I tried to phone you at work,</i>
<i>but you were in a meeting...</i>

600
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,804
<i>... and you couldn't be interrupted.</i>

601
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,898
No.

602
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,610
<i>So, listen, why don't you fly down?</i>

603
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,043
To Los Angeles?

604
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:41,349
<i>The last flight gets here at 10:00 p.m.</i>
<i>I can meet you at the airport.</i>

605
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,317
But I can't just...

606
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,616
<i>Listen, we'll spend the evening together...</i>

607
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:50,386
<i>... and we'll be back in San Francisco</i>
<i>by 10:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

608
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,355
<i>Hello?</i>

609
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,064
<i>Teddy, hello?</i>

610
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,212
- Honey. What's all this, cutie?
- A celebration.

611
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,014
- For what?
- Just for fun.

612
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,955
I'm too tired to go out, so I wanted
to have a party, just you, the kids and me.

613
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,218
What do you think?

614
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,310
- Shall we have a drink?
- That would be nice.

615
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,589
But take the phone off the hook.

616
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,889
Would you like to make love?

617
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,322
Now?

618
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,631
Take the phone off the hook.

619
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,205
Who's that?

620
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,712
I don't know yet.

621
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,246
Telegram for Theodore Pierce.

622
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,927
It's a telegram!

623
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,196
- A telegram? Who for?
- For you.

624
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,496
For me?

625
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,299
Who from?

626
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,477
- It's from the office.
- All right. Stop the kidding, now.

627
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,178
No, it's not a joke.

628
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,410
<i>"</i>You must attend the transport symposium

No.

- No?
- No.

634
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,740

No.

I am not going.

638
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,586
Well, how can you say no?

639
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:08,283
Easy. No. You see that?
That's not so difficult, is it?

640
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:12,418
I'm not going! I don't care if they fire me!
I'm not leaving my wife and kids!

641
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,156
Don't act like a child!

642
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,731
Teddy! Stop.

643
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,462
Wait a minute! Hold the plane!

644
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,541
Wait for me!

645
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,372
Hold it! Wait!

646
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,050
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are beginning our descent into Los Angeles.</i>

647
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,115
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>
<i>extinguish all smoking materials...</i>

648
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,421
Finished with your drink, sir?

649
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,487
- What's your name?
- Polly.

650
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,565
Polly?

651
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,300
- That's a lovely name.
- Thank you.

652
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,200
- Thanks very much, Polly.
- Sure.

653
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,241
Sure, you make the announcement.

654
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:07,677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

655
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:12,744
<i>The captain has just informed me that</i>
<i>L.A. Airport is closed due to heavy fog.</i>

656
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:18,558
<i>We will be landing in San Diego. You'll receive</i>
<i>further instruction once we're on the ground.</i>

657
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,059
Thanks a lot.

658
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,145
Hello?

659
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,380
Hi, honey.

660
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:51,424
I was running from outside.
I heard the phone ringing.

661
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,963
No, it's okay.

662
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,425
Go ahead.

663
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,432
I took Shelly and the girls to a movie.

664
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,930
Well, don't worry about me.

665
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,341
I have to study, anyway.
Shelly, please get out of my bedroom.

666
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,936
Are you afraid?

667
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,009
What?

668
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,514
Teddy, why are you giving me all these details?

669
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,920
- I am going to scream.
- So will I.

670
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,990
Of course you're in San Diego.
Where else would you be?

671
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,225
- I am going to tell your mother.
- She already knows.

672
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,526
What?

673
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,398
- You're crazy.
- I want to marry you.

674
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,041
Yes, there's plenty of food.
Don't worry about me.

675
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,305
Shelly!

676
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,343
Of course I miss you.

677
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,244
Me, too.

678
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,208
I love you.

679
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,280
Me, too.

680
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,257
I love you. Bye-bye.

681
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,291
Are you going to finish the game or not?

682
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,092
You got any Hershey bars?

683
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,278
<i>While Didi was waiting for me</i>
<i>in San Francisco...</i>

684
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,409
<i>... Charlotte was waiting in Los Angeles.</i>

685
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,380
<i>Two women waiting for me</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

686
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,679
<i>Crazy as it seems...</i>

687
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,287
<i>... I had adventure in my life.</i>

688
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,164
<i>Surprise of surprises.</i>

689
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,244
<i>Next day, Joe's wife came back with the kids...</i>

690
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,077
<i>... and the furniture.</i>

691
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,409
<i>Why she suddenly forgave him, nobody knew.</i>

692
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,323
Eric?

693
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,933
Is there an Eric?

694
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,600
Come on.

695
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,812
<i>The next couple of days were full of surprises.</i>

696
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,820
Hello, Ted.

697
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:38,253
I just wanted to say,
<i>"</i>Good morning, and have a lovely day<i>."</i>

698
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,063
Hello?

699
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,903
<i>Hello, how are you?</i>

700
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,057
<i>The best surprise of all</i>
<i>was a phone call from Charlotte.</i>

701
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,989
<i>I thought I wouldn't see her again...</i>

702
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,896
<i>... but she called to find out</i>
<i>I got back all right from San Diego.</i>

703
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,938
<i>During our 35-minute stroll,</i>
<i>I realized I was still in a deep fog.</i>

704
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,270
Here you go.

705
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,779
<i>The only unpleasant surprise</i>
<i>was that in two days...</i>

706
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,481
<i>... Joe was back in form.</i>

707
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,607
He's scared.

708
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,685
At 2:00 in the morning, he could fool me.

709
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,846
What's the problem?
You go over, you get into bed, you say:

710
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,222
<i>"</i>Dr. Schumacher, I've got a chill coming on.
I thought I'd better get under the covers<i>."</i>

711
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,896
You guys want to play some checkers?

712
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,457
Miss!

713
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,657
- You know where I can buy some checkers?
- That's embarrassing.

714
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,896
I'm in the mood to play a little game
if you have some time.

715
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:58,030
- I'm very good, really.
- Yeah, right.

716
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:03,106
She wasn't wearing a bra. Did you see that?
Did you see the way they bounce?

717
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,011
You'd kill for that, Teddy. You'd kill for that.

718
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,878
- I didn't notice she wasn't wearing a bra.
- You're weird.

719
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,748
- I looked at her, though!
- You're weird.

720
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,321
He's a weird guy, isn't he?

721
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:16,687
- Did you notice that she didn't have a bra?
- What do I know, 'cause I see it every day?

722
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,459
You poor bitch.

723
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,526
It's open.

724
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,805
- How you doing?
- Good.

725
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,840
I thought you'd painted this place.

726
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,513
I was going to, before I moved in with my friend.

727
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,751
Well, you've got a nice chair.

728
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,253
Thanks.

729
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,727
- What color you gonna paint?
- Shocking pink!

730
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:17,205
This man walks into a doctor's office,
he says, <i>"</i>Doctor...

731
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,877
<i>"...</i>I have a terrible problem.
I can't remember anything<i>."</i>

732
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,177
And...

733
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,783
...the doctor says...

734
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,710
...I mean, the man says:

735
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,483
<i>"</i>I can't think of<i>...</i>

736
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,355
<i>"</i>I don't even remember words.

737
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,984
<i>"</i>I can't retain a word.

738
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,563
<i>"</i>There's nothing that I say that I can remember<i>."</i>

739
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,256
And the doctor says:

740
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,300
<i>"</i>How long have you had this problem?<i>"</i>

741
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,369
And the man says, <i>"</i>What problem?<i>"</i>

742
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,604
That's your best joke?

743
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,178
You'll be all right.

744
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,314
It just takes time.

745
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,862
You want to see something? Look at this thing.

746
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,330
I feel silly.

747
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,627
- What if I had a date?
- You won't have a date.

748
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,397
- I said, <i>"</i>What if I have a date?<i>"</i>
- You won't have one!

749
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,269
I know I said that. I said, <i>"</i>What if I had a date?<i>"</i>

750
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,138
If you have a date, I'll be your chauffeur!

751
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:22,872
All right.

752
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,982
- The joke is over.
- A bet's a bet.

753
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,882
What was this bet?

754
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:35,284
I told him if I couldn't get him
his new car by tonight, I'd be his chauffeur.

755
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,592
- So, where are we going?
- We're going to Mama Dell's.

756
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,693
You're going on your first date
to your grandmother's?

757
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,892
No, you silly!

758
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,830
We made this date and I remembered
it was Mama Dell's birthday...

759
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:53,500
...so I called her and I found out
she's gonna be all alone on her 85th birthday.

760
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,908
We'll drop by for five minutes,
just to have a glass of champagne.

761
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,244
But I'd feel terrible,
because I know it would mean so much to her.

762
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,011
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

763
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,918
You don't feel concerned at all that<i>...</i>

764
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,290
- What?
- Well, no, I'm just saying, you know.

765
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,189
You know where<i>...</i>

766
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,563
Didi?

767
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,901
Didi and Mama Dell
don't even talk to each other.

768
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,261
Okay.

769
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,005
Who's Didi?

770
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,378
Who's Didi?

771
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,084
Didi<i>...</i>

772
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,056
Didi is<i>...</i>

773
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,827
Didi is Teddy's other grandmother!

774
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,394
Funny woman.

775
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,996
Can't mention her name, but it makes you laugh.

776
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,665
What a kidder!

777
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,506
That Didi.

778
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,914
Will you do me a favor,
and come up for three minutes?

779
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:10,986
She loves you.

780
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,782
Two minutes. We'll have champagne...

781
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:16,655
Okay, I'll just come up to say hello
and give her a kiss. But I can't stay.

782
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:20,126
- All right, I'll see you in two minutes.
- Driver, you can't park here.

783
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,663
Don't give me a hard time.
I'll be a couple minutes.

784
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:26,792
I'm not giving you a hard time.
You either move the car, or I call the police.

785
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,267
Go ahead up. I'll be right up.

786
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,339
- See you in a little while.
- All right.

787
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,678
- You look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

788
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,817
- You smell very good. What is it?
- Sandalwood.

789
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:55,126
Don't worry, we don't have to stay long.
She'll understand.

790
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,461
- Is that you, Teddy?
- Mama Dell.

791
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:58,659
Come in, honey.

792
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:02,295
What's going on here?
You trying to save on the electricity bills?

793
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:04,103
Mama Dell?

01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,418
Well!

800
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,090
How do you like that?

801
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,288
I don't believe it!

802
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,799
No. Gilbert!

803
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,768
- What are you doing here? You're in Arizona!
- Happy birthday.

804
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,270
But my birthday's tomorrow.

805
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,566
Ain't no surprise tomorrow.

806
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:40,471
Steetsy, what're you doin' up so late?

807
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,409
- It's Steven, now.
- All right, no more Steetsy.

808
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,207
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thank you.

809
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,077
Thank you, baby. Thank you very much.

810
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:49,481
You! Devil-woman!

811
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,574
Happy birthday!

812
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,883
- What're you doin' to me?
- You should've seen the look on your face.

813
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,720
You know why?
Because it's supposed to be your birthday!

814
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,226
- Didi.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

815
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,893
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- My little baby!

816
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,364
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- Another little baby.

817
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,298
Daddy, you smell good.

818
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,896
Did I introduce you?

819
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,332
Didi.

820
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,476
Well, let me introduce you.

821
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,403
I was just so overwhelmed.

822
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,747
I'd like you to meet<i>...</i>

823
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,644
This is<i>...</i>

824
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,815
Everybody, please say hello to<i>...</i>

825
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,524
You know, you really caught me off guard,
you silly people.

826
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,752
No, honestly, you did. You're silly!

827
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,953
You're just silly people.

828
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:38,098
Anyway, no, I do want you to say hello.

829
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,100
- I want you to meet...
- Where's Mama Dell?

830
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,000
Where's that girl? Hello, darling.

831
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,969
Didi. Hello, darling!

832
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,675
Hey, you lost some weight there,
you're lookin' great!

833
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,047
How are you? I didn't know it was a party!

834
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,679
- We didn't know you were coming!
- I'm not coming. I mean, I can't stay.

835
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,917
I just wanted to come by
and give the birthday girl a kiss!

836
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,289
Happy birthday, sweetie pie!

837
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,425
- Did you say hello, Charlotte?
- Hello.

838
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:13,601
This is my sweetheart, Mama Dell.
This is my sweetheart.

839
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,637
I love this girl!

840
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,231
Hello, Charlotte.

841
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,771
- Sit down, Charlotte.
- No, we can't stay.

842
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,344
- We've got tickets to a...
- It takes two minutes!

843
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,744
She's crazy about music! What can I tell you?

844
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,784
No, she a stickler for being on time.
She's trying to reform. No, we can't.

845
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,445
It's a family party, everybody.

846
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,388
Happy birthday, Teddy.
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

847
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,322
Good-bye, Mama Dell. Happy birthday!

848
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,950
Say good-bye.

849
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,985
Say, good-bye, Charlotte.

850
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,891
Good-bye.

851
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,360
Good-bye.

852
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,899
All right. Good-bye, everybody.

853
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,803
Yeah, Daddy, hurry up.

854
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,413
Hold it! I'll be right there.

855
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,011
Bye, Mama. Thank you for everything.

856
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,683
- 'Bye, cuz. See you tomorrow.
- Happy birthday, Teddy.

857
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,350
Bye-bye.

858
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,624
Bye! Come back soon.

859
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:17,425
- Now, I told you, you cannot stay up late.
- But let me watch this one show.

860
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,522
No!

861
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,697
If it's cotton, and if it's blue, you can't go wrong.

862
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,671
Now don't go neurotic on me.
I loved that present.

863
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:25,832
Teddy!

864
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,238
I'm sorry. It's your birthday.

865
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,504
I hate to run interrupt your celebration.

866
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,910
He's flipped out. I think he's gonna kill himself.

867
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,380
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Joe!

868
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,418
She left him! She walked out.
I don't know what happened.

869
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,317
- Where is he?
- Across the street.

870
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,821
I'm really sorry.

871
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,983
- Teddy's like the voice of reason.
- You did right. It's terrible.

872
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,926
- I'm terrible at this kind of stuff, Didi!
- Michael!

873
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:50,658
- Joe, I'm right here. Will you talk to me?
- She left me. I gotta kill her.

874
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:51,960
Joe, calm down.

875
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,559
- You leave me alone so I can kill her!
- Joe!

876
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,103
I gotta kill her!

877
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,836
I gotta kill her!

878
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,736
- Calm down! Just calm down.
- Let me kill her.

879
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,504
You'll be all right.

880
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,136
Take it easy, you stupid bastards!

881
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:06,674
I'm finished.

882
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:07,840
I'm done!

883
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,042
Calm down!

884
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,448
I'm finished!

885
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,814
- Teddy, should I go home?
- Yeah!

886
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,117
- What?
- Yes! Go home!

887
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,215
It's okay.

888
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:23,193
- Do you have a key?
- Yes! Get the kids out of here!

889
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,961
All right! Girls, go on. I'll be there in a minute.

890
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,102
- She took my kids again.
- Get in the car.

891
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:33,198
- Why did she take my kids again?
- It'll be all right tomorrow.

892
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,800
- I want to kill her!
- Get in the driver seat.

893
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:36,935
Get in the car.

894
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,447
- Shut up, down there!
- Up yours, you half a hard on!

895
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,517
Let me get that peckerhead!

896
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:02,534
Joe, I know you're in a lot of pain,
but I want to tell you something.

897
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,402
No, Teddy! I want to tell you something.

898
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:12,207
- <i>"</i>Happy birthday to you<i>"</i>
- No.

899
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,147
- <i>"</i>Happy birthday to you<i>"</i>
- No.

900
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:19,085
- <i>"</i>Happy birthday, dear Teddy<i>"</i>
- You fucks! You fucking jerks!

901
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,383
<i>"</i>Happy birthday to you<i>"</i>

902
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:25,620
You're babies, you're little babies,
the biggest assholes I've ever seen my life!

903
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,595
- We never said we weren't assholes.
- I said I was an asshole.

904
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:31,222
Where are we going? Will somebody tell me?

905
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:36,168
- Somebody wants to see you.
- She's modeling from midnight till dawn.

906
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,139
And she wants you for breakfast.

907
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,406
What am I supposed to say to her?

908
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,446
You say to her,
<i>"</i>Hello, angel-face, you want to see my goods?<i>"</i>

909
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,880
Get out of here! She wants you. Move it!

910
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:51,146
- It was her idea. Ask Buddy.
- She likes you. Go figure.

911
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,086
What are you talking about?
Look at that face and those eyes.

912
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,421
Look at how that nose sparkles.
What more could you want in a guy?

913
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,553
- How am I supposed to know? Ask Buddy.
- Screw Buddy. I can go for him myself.

914
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:05,225
If he'd just shave his legs, like I keep telling him.
Shave 'em!

915
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,600
- Happy birthday, Teddy!
- Happy birthday, pal!

916
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,969
Wait a minute. Come here a sec.

917
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,737
Look, really, in all seriousness,
don't get your dick caught in your zipper.

918
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,279
- You have no taste!
- Taste? Who wants taste?

919
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,977
What the hell am I? Charlie the Tuna?
Get out of here. Let's get action.

920
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:27,613
We're running out of laughs.
Let's go to the opera, drop our pants.

921
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,893
Now, listen here, Teddy bear.

922
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,562
Four weeks ago...

923
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,131
...I met a cute, available...

924
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,699
...old-fashioned guy...

925
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,860
...who liked horse riding.

926
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,195
In one month...

927
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:25,898
...you got married...

928
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,601
...you had two daughters...

929
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:32,142
...and you can't ride a horse to save your life.

930
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,510
Don't stare at your shoes, look at me.

931
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,515
Because since tonight...

932
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,484
...I want you more...

933
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,986
...then I ever wanted any other man.

934
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,223
Can you tell me why?

935
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,430
I don't know.

936
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:22,661
You've been dreaming about this
for a long time, haven't you?

937
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,733
This isn't a dream anymore.

938
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,438
This is really happening.

939
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,944
So, where do you want to break the ice?
Here or in bed?

940
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,108
Well<i>...</i>

941
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,242
Let's see.

942
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,687
I don't mind really.

943
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,881
This is nice here.

944
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,748
The bed is good,
bed might be comfortable, but...

945
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,358
...lots of interesting chairs,
and stools, couches<i>...</i>

946
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,931
Come on, let's go to bed.

947
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,521
It's a water bed.

948
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,757
This should be fun.

949
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,056
Wait a minute. Do you come
into bed with your shoes and socks?

950
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,323
Sorry.

951
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,623
Don't want to start a fire.
They landed on the lamp.

952
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,628
Do you mind taking them off?

953
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,325
Sorry.

954
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,766
Come and get it, cowboy.

955
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,515
Hello?

956
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:36,648
<i>Charlotte?</i>

957
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,789
<i>Charlotte!</i>

958
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,565
Yes!

959
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,596
What is it?

960
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,899
Nothing, my husband's downstairs.

961
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:56,500
- Your husband!
- Yeah. Hurry up, come on, get dressed!

962
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,007
What do you mean, <i>"</i>Hurry up<i>"</i>?
What husband?

963
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,445
Please, hurry up!

964
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,575
- He wasn't due back until Friday.
- But it's only Wednesday.

965
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:07,246
Yeah, you want to ask him why?
He's six-foot-two and he's an airline pilot.

966
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,189
If he finds you here, he's going to kill you.
Get dressed.

967
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,355
What are you doing in my husband's robe?

968
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,330
I'm not going to get caught half-dressed!

969
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,631
Why play games?
I'll talk to him man to man, that's all.

970
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:58,763
Are you crazy?
He's going to tear your balls apart!

971
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,707
- What are you doing? Where are we going?
- Quickly, get outside!

972
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:05,371
- This is a window!
- I know it's a window. It's this or the door.

973
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,415
You must be joking! That's 100 feet down there.

974
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,144
Please! I won't be very long.

975
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,379
- Come on, Charlotte!
- I won't be long.

976
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,149
He's probably got a taxi waiting.
He never stays long.

977
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,347
Just stand out on the ledge.

978
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,592
- Please, quickly. Don't worry. It's safe.
- God.

979
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,859
- Now, just wait for me there.
- Jesus.

980
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,211
Coming, darling.

981
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,395
Get away.

982
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,922
Who is that?

983
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,758
My God!

984
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:56,849
Better call the fire department!
There's a man about to jump off of that building!

985
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,601
- What's up, babe? Where we goin'?
- Suicide.

986
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,858
No! Not the ladder! It scares them.

987
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,121
It makes them jump every time! Take it down!

988
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,629
Take it out of here, take it down!

989
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,767
<i>Come on, people, a little cooperation here!</i>

990
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,966
<i>Let's have some cooperation. This is</i>
<i>a dangerous area. We've got a man up there.</i>

991
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:50,267
<i>Come on, folks.</i>

992
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,881
<i>Come on, folks. Give us a break.</i>

993
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,652
Excuse me.

994
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,018
Roger, we got it!

995
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,858
- You got him?
- I got him.

996
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,334
<i>Come on, people.</i>

997
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:18,966
<i>Okay, stand by.</i>
<i>Fine, we have reached the network.</i>

998
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,400
<i>Stand by. Counting down.</i>

999
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:25,468
<i>Five-four-three-two-one. You're on.</i>

1000
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,977
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>This is Marvin Kausberg, Channel 5 news.</i>

1001
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:31,782
That looks a little like Daddy.

1002
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,185
<i>... a man was seen on the ledge of a ninth-floor...</i>

1003
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,313
It does!

1004
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:38,181
<i>The identity of the man is not yet known.</i>

1005
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:43,255
<i>The police have arrived and the fire department</i>
<i>suicide team, plus a substantial crowd.</i>

1006
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,494
<i>All of us waiting here,</i>
<i>in the small courtyard below...</i>

1007
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,968
<i>... are very unclear as to</i>
<i>what the man's motives are.</i>

1008
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,005
<i>He appears relaxed.</i>

1009
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:56,537
<i>In fact, he's seated on a small window sill,</i>
<i>smoking a cigarette.</i>

1010
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,977
<i>But he looks disturbed by all the attention...</i>

1011
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,208
<i>... as he hides his face</i>
<i>and waves the crowd away.</i>

1012
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,410
<i>The police are trying to control the crowd...</i>

1013
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,419
<i>... who are now calling for the man to jump.</i>

1014
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,182
<i>The question being asked here today...</i>

1015
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,782
<i>... is whether this man</i>
<i>does or does not want to commit suicide.</i>

1016
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:13,789
Teddy!

1017
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:17,698
Two, three.

1018
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,627
It'll be all right!

1019
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,571
We'll catch you!

1020
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,138
Dive!

1021
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,919
- Baby!
- That's so good.

1022
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:58,296
Yes!

1023
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:06,881
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

1024
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,883
<i>I have a wonderful wife!</i>

1025
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,610
Jump!

1026
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,887
<i>I could have thrown my whole life away.</i>

1027
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,724
<i>And for what?</i>

1028
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,458
<i>A piece of ass.</i>

1029
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:39,046
<i>What's that girl doing?</i>
<i>What is she doing, taking more pictures?</i>

1030
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,577
<i>No, give me a break!</i>

1031
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:43,982
<i>She is cute, though.</i>

1032
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,286
<i>Look at those legs!</i>

1033
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:49,482
<i>Hey, come on, now, stop it. None of that stuff.</i>

1034
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:52,151
<i>I made a mistake, I learned my lesson...</i>

1035
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,728
<i>... and I will never do it again.</i>
