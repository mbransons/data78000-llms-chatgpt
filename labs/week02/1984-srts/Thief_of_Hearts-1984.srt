Hi, Mrs. Davis,
you look beautiful.

27
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,589
Hi, Buddy.
Thank you.

28
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,893
Buddy, how are you?
Mr. Davis, good to see you.

29
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,728
Good to see you.
All right.

30
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,130
Now the maitre d' tells me

31
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,099
that tonight's your wedding anniversary.
Is that the truth?

32
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,700
The absolute truth.

33
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,834
Really? How many
could that be?

34
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,469
Would you believe six?

35
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,338
Six? Get out of here!

36
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,208
Nobody stays married for six. I'm
very proud of you two. Very proud.

This is Bud. Come on in.

53
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,110
I'm here.

54
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,312
All right, listen, they, uh,
they just drove in.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,316
I'll get back to you as soon
they ask for their claim check.

56
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,584
Do that.
I'm goin' to work.

57
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,290
Thank you.

58
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,560
Happy anniversary, darling.

59
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,432
Mmm.

60
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,634
Great!
Oh!

61
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,970
Looks delicious.
Mmm.

62
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:10,871
Sheep in legwarmers.

63
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,207
How's work?

64
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,509
You and Janie gonna get
that thing off the ground?

65
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,712
As a matter of fact,

66
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,715
we've been chosen to do the kitchen
for the new showcase house.

67
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,650
There's no money in it
but it's great exposure.

68
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,387
How much is this gonna cost me?

69
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:25,346
When did you find out
about this showcase thing?

70
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:30,451
I found out about this
"showcase thing" last week.

71
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,322
Why didn't you tell me?

72
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,592
Said the man who hasn't left his
typewriter for over a month.

73
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,593
You're right.

74
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,395
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,531
This March deadline's
killing me.

76
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,899
What the hell?

77
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,377
Wait, wait, wait...

78
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,312
Somebody may be up there.

79
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,994
Come on, Nicole, huh?
Do me a favor.

80
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,998
My new guy's real tense, he's new
in the city, he's got no friends,

81
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,901
and I think if he doesn't get a little
friendship soon he's gonna go over.

82
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:28,936
I'm serious.

83
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,840
No, no weird stuff,
this guy is a sweet...

84
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,409
You're probably gonna fall in
love with this guy and have kids!

85
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,511
That was a joke.

86
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,780
Listen, how about an hour?

87
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,816
An hour's good? Great, Nicole.
An hour's good. I'll talk to you later.

88
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,796
Oh, yes.
God bless America.

89
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,134
Scotty.

90
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,107
Scotty.

91
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,810
We are really
starting to happen.

92
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,714
Look how far we've come from that
little black hole they had us in, huh?

93
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,215
How much is this worth
right here, like ten grand?

94
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,383
Which one?
The big one. The pink one.

95
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,285
More than that man, 15,

96
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,220
the one behind it, maybe 20.

97
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,089
Gotta tell the old man to sell it
out of state though, all right?

98
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,491
Local artist.

99
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,793
Do you realize
how good you are, man? Huh?

100
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,061
How few guys have the eye
for the good like you?

101
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,865
Every time you go out, every
time you bring back 100 grand.

102
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,934
Scotty, you're not listening
to me, man, huh?

103
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,402
Something happened tonight,
didn't it?

104
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,337
What're you talking about?
You got that look like something happened.

105
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,506
Huh?

106
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,041
You broke your cherry.
Huh?

107
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,177
There was someone home
and you had to handle it. Huh?

108
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,946
Scotty, tell me!
I've been there!
Tell me, man!

109
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,883
Nothing happened.
Huh?

110
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,753
Nothing. I walked in,
walked out, same as always.

111
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,555
So what's with the girl?
Huh? What girl?

112
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,990
What girl!

113
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,792
You're gonna love that girl.
She gives head like a fucking iguana.

114
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,028
I'll go shower.

115
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,132
All right, hey! Anything happen tonight
you're not telling me about?

116
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,200
Nothing happened.
Huh?

117
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,036
One for the road.

118
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,471
No, you do it.
Huh? You're gonna leave me to celebrate alone?

119
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,609
All right, you call me!
I will.

120
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:19,212
Hey! We are fuckin' happening
and you can't deny it!

121
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,583
We are gonna be
rich fucking men.

122
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,658
What was in there?

123
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,828
Um, some personal things.
Nothing very important.

124
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,897
Uh-huh.

125
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,666
How soon do you think you'll
catch whoever did this?

126
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,301
We won't catch him.

127
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,169
And what kind
of an attitude is that?

128
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,674
Oh, we catch the stupid kids
and the junkies

129
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,644
but the professionals
move too fast for us.

130
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,946
Don't be too surprised
if he comes back again.

131
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,549
Why would he come back?

132
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,287
Well, for the new stuff you're gonna
get when the insurance pays you.

133
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:06,594
I've known certain houses to get hit three,
four, even five times by the same guy.

134
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,497
And since most people lie
to their insurance companies,

135
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,633
the value goes up every time.

136
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,474
Come on, Scotty. Yes.

137
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,678
No. No. No.

138
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:27,380
It's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

139
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,149
Just... Just get off, please.

140
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,918
Please, get off. Please.

141
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,624
What's... What's the matter?

142
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,127
Nothing's the matter.
Just go home.

143
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,029
What did I do wrong?
Just tell me what I did wrong.

144
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,364
You didn't do
nothing wrong, okay?

145
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,900
Just... Here,
take your clothes

146
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,904
and leave.

147
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,873
There's nothing
wrong with you. It's me.

148
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:55,943
Here.

149
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,758
You know, Buddy told me
that you're new in town.

150
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,794
I know what that's like.

151
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,799
I've been in four cities
since I was 17.

152
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,334
How old are you now?

153
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,073
Eighteen and a half.

154
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,220
Look...

155
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,662
Here, buy yourself
a pretty dress or something.

156
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,731
Okay?

157
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:57,838
Here.

158
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,240
Buy a real nice one.

159
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,746
Okay?

160
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,357
I feel so violated.

161
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,261
It'll be all right, darling.

162
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,864
The insurance'll
cover most of it.

163
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,901
What if he's reading them?

164
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:29,870
Mick,

165
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,809
I love you. Listen, whoever did this
probably took your journals by accident.

166
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,213
The way you kept them locked up,

167
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,750
he probably thought he was
getting the family jewels.

168
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,122
But he didn't
and I can prove it.

169
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,225
Come here.

170
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,593
Hmm.

171
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,428
Mick, come on.
It's still our anniversary.

172
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,031
Just hold me, okay?

173
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,197
Oh, Mick. Bad girl.

174
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,408
Oh, who knows, maybe
some good will come of it.

175
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,145
You are amazing, Davis.
What?

176
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,448
You're hit for nearly 100 grand and
you're looking for the good in it?

177
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:51,118
Why don't you try to pick the good
outta that poodle shit down there.

178
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,854
Really. I mean,

179
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,455
if you'd come down out of Mr.
Rogers' neighborhood

180
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,257
for like, you know, two seconds,

181
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,259
you'd realize
the world is fucked.

182
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,096
Your world is fucked, Marty.

183
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,465
My world is perfect.

184
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,870



185
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,506
Come on in, Scotty,
we been waiting for you.

186
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,878
Girls, this is Scotty, the movie
producer I was telling you about.

187
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,779
Scotty, that's Aileen
and that's Tracy.

188
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,616
Can we talk?
Sure, we can talk.

189
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,652
No, privately.
Come on. Excuse us.

190
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,187
We'll be right back.
Little family business.

191
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,925
Cash from last night.
You got it?

192
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,726
Yeah, I got it right here,
but stick around,

193
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,096
these girls'd go down on an anteater
for what I got on the table.

194
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,331
I can't stay.
I got other plans.

195
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,134
Listen, Scotty, I spoke to
Nicole, you know, and...

196
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,702
What's going on?
Is everything okay?

197
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,204
Doesn't sound like
the Herman I used to know.

198
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,639
This is light now. What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

199
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,242
The old man said he'd get
back to me on the paintings.

200
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,543
Yeah, he'll get back to you!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

201
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,880
Scotty, stick around, okay?

202
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,015
I set this up for you.
This is a bonus.

203
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,084
These broads
aren't even hookers.

204
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,453
You're a great guy, man.
Yeah.

205
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,290
Have fun, okay? I can't stay.
All right? Don't kill yourself on this shit, okay?

206
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,026
Bye.

207
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,085
There are two me's, really.
Mickey and Michelle.

208
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,621
Mickey is this
mousy little hausfrau

209
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,590
who hasn't taken a real
chance in her whole life.

210
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,794
Michelle, on the other hand,
is up for anything.

211
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:45,933
The only trouble with Michelle is that she
lives and breathes only on these pages.

212
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,220
Aren't you letting your
imagination run a little?

213
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,891
The odds against a crook
being sensitive enough

214
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,227
to get into your diaries
is about a billion to one.

215
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,530
Yeah.

216
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,602
Yeah, you're probably right.

217
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,410
What?

218
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,246
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,683
I was just getting off
on the fantasy.

220
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,089
You would.

221
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,492
Admit it, Pointer, you're about the
horniest creature in the universe.

222
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,961
I admit it.

223
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,600
Okay.

224
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,437
I'm getting out of here because I'm
not gonna get anything done today.

225
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,507
See you.

226
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,779
Honey, it's me!

227
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,485
Oh, I'm sorry, I... I heard your car
drive up and I knew the light was out.

228
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,121
Are you okay?
Oh...

229
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,489
Oh, thank God you're here.

230
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,626
Oh.
You're shaking. Come on. Come on inside.

231
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,339
Ray,

232
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,109
I want to get an alarm,

233
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,043
a dog,

234
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,982
and a gun we can keep
in the house someplace.

235
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:53,186
Hold on, we're not gonna change our
whole lives because of this thing, are we?

236
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,124
Well, you heard what the police
said, he might come back.

237
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,426
Mick, he's not coming back.

238
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,429
Come on, now, relax.

239
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,364
Janie keeps a gun
in her bedside table.

240
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,136
What for? To force some poor
bastard to rape her at gunpoint?

241
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,007
Look, I'm facing
a very scary deadline here,

242
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,477
I don't have a lot of energy left
over to keep reassuring you.

243
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,149
You're not still
teasing yourself

244
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,583
with this crazy stuff
about the journals, are you?

245
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,162
I'm gonna go take a bath.

246
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,697
See you in a bit.

247
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,468
Mick, are you sure you're okay?

248
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,639
Mick?

249
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,252
Water. I love water.

250
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:35,655
I was born near the water and used
to sail all the time with my dad.

251
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:45,665
I spend every minute I can in
water, in my bath, usually.

252
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,702
Water washes me clean.
Water is sexual. Water is healing.

253
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:56,175
He takes me to the water,
a huge yacht like a castle.

254
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,246
The sun is hot, intoxicating,

255
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,315
the water undulates under us.

256
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:07,387
My resistance drains away, his body
is strong, his face is beautiful.

257
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,825
He touches himself,
rubbing lotion into his skin.

258
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,028
I feel him enjoying
his own flesh.

259
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,465
His mouth
is suddenly on my neck,

260
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:22,469
and moving over my shoulder,
then circling my breasts.

261
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:26,473
His tongue slides down my stomach.
I'm melting under the sun.

262
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,154
I'm sorry, I wasn't watching
where I was going. I'm so sorry.

263
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,189
It's okay.
It was my fault.

264
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,758
You don't have to do that.

265
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,329
But I want to.

266
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,302
Okay, there's nothing broken,
everything's in place.

267
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:32,271
Here, let me hop these
into your car.

268
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:33,606
No, no, no.

269
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,941
Okay?

270
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,053
You all right?

271
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:49,956
Yeah, I'm fine.

272
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:51,891
You don't look fine.

273
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,860
You sure you can drive?

274
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,496
Of course I can drive.

275
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,668
Okay.

276
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:05,738
Here.

277
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:11,544
There you go.

278
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,614
Watch your skirt.

279
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,754
Before you go, I bet I can guess
your favorite ice cream flavor.

280
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:27,093
Haagen-Dazs rum raisin, right?

281
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,565
How'd you know that?

282
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,472
There you go.

283
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,308
I'm afraid
it's a little melted, but...

284
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:46,446
Well, that's no problem, I...

285
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,415
I like melted rum raisin.

286
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,385
Well, I'll see you around, okay?
Thanks.

287
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,887
Bye.

288
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,441
No, no, Mick.

289
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,310
Please, Mickey.
It's time for ice cream.

290
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,812
Thank you, no. Mick!

291
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,515
Mickey, really, I'm...

292
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,050
What are you doing?

293
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,353
I'm seducing you.

294
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:02,689
Great. Great.
Thank you, you're...

295
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,892
Thank you. Listen,
your timing's terrific.

296
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,159
I'm... I'm right in the middle
of a roll here,

297
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,595
can you give me a few minutes?
I'll be right with you.

298
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,697
Mmm-mmm.
All right, mmm...

299
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,331
Mickey, will you stop with the ice cream?
Just give me a couple...

300
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,000
Mick!

301
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,202
This is not a good thing to do.
This is not a good time.

302
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,870
Mickey...

303
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,843
I'll see you later, okay?
Goodbye. Hmm?

305
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,045
I promise, I'll be done
in just a little bit. Really.

306
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,649
Promise. Cross my heart.

307
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,151

from under my skin... ♪

322
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,652
I thought it was you.

323
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:46,919
You surprised me.

324
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,922
So, how you doin'?

325
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,825
Last time I saw you,
you were a little shaky.

326
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,629
You were very nice that day.
Thank you.

327
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,931
So, things better?

328
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,634
Not really.

329
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:08,908
Do you work?

330
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,078
You seem to have an awful
lot of time for shopping.

331
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,081
Yeah, I work.
How about you?

332
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,651
Yeah, I work too.
Oh, yeah? What do you do?

333
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,453
I'm an interior designer.

334
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,522
No? That's a coincidence.

335
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,691
Oh? Why?

336
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:26,926
I'm looking for a designer.

337
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,931
No, really. I mean, I've been
interviewing designers all week

338
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:32,965
for some work I wanna have
done in my apartment.

339
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,134
Hmm. Who'd you talk to?

340
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,770
Well, Tom Shapiro,

341
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:41,173
Sam Dugan and Bernie Terry.

342
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,811
Well, those guys are the best.

343
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:49,281
Um, my partner and I are new

344
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,351
but if you're interested
in seeing some of our work

345
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,754
we're designing the kitchen
for a new showcase house.

346
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,723
It's opening next week.

347
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:59,125
Really? That's quite
an honor, isn't it?

348
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,894
I hear there's hundreds
of applicants for every room.

349
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:05,397
Yeah. There were 164
applicants for the kitchen.

350
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,399
Oh, then you must be good.

351
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,708
Anyway, um, if you'd like to
come, I'll give you the address.

352
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:17,877
Sure.

353
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:19,879
Yeah.

354
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,882
God, I can never find a pen.

355
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,752
Look, I'll tell you what, I'm going outside
and having a cup of coffee before I go,

356
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:29,722
so if you ever find a pen,
write it down, drop it off.

357
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,735
Hi.
Hi.

358
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,873
I... I found one of my cards, I
wrote the address on the back.

359
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,942
So, uh, I hope you can make it.

360
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,678
Well, how about a cup of coffee?
I ordered you one.

361
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,280
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

362
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,815
Oh, come on, what's one
little cup of coffee?

363
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,187
Well, um...

364
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,254
Come on.

365
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,724
I can just stay
a minute. I...

366
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,761
It's my turn to cook tonight.

367
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:10,396
We trade off every other night.

368
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,330
"We"?

369
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,966
Yeah, I'm married.
Didn't I tell you?

370
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:15,935
No, you didn't.

371
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,470
Well, I am.

372
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,508
So, how is it?

373
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:27,213
Oh. It's perfect.

374
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:32,885
How'd you know
I like cream and sugar?

375
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,989
Actually I didn't,
you picked up my cup.

376
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,092
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,830
Boy.

378
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:45,397
You must think
I'm a total basket case,

379
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:46,999
every time you see me
I'm dropping stuff...

380
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:50,336
No, actually I think you're
very, very attractive.

381
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,974
I bet you're talented too.

382
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,979
Well, we'll find out soon,
won't we?

383
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,123
Well, I really do have to go.

384
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:14,126
Um, I hope you can make it.

385
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,298
I'll get this.

386
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,868
Okay.

387
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,074
Bye.

388
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,008
Bye.

389
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,396
Hey.

390
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,366
Calamara.

391
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,468
I got your message.

392
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:58,938
You got a cigarette, man? I'm
having a fucking nicotine fit.

393
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,840
Are you fucking kidding me, man, huh?
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

394
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,076
I've been calling you all week.

395
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,377
Yeah, well, I've
been busy, you know.

396
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,279
Yeah. Busy doing what?
Teasin' your new hair style?

397
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,781
Your new pretty threads?
Hey! I had a date, you mind?

398
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,450
No, I don't mind
the date, man, no.

399
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,085
Like I set up for you,
inside, remember?

400
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,553
Huh?

401
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:19,091
Is this about work or...
Yes! Yes, it's about work!

402
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,392
A rich lawyer in Tiburon.
You interested?

403
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,629
I'll get the van ready.

404
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,098
You're sure about it?

405
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,334
Yeah, Scotty, I'm sure.
You sure?

406
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,076



407
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,018
Mickey!

408
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,923
How we doing?

409
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,258
I think we're a hit.

410
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,264
Look at that gorgeous guy.

411
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,408
Hi.

412
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,145
Hi.

413
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,713
You made it.
Of course.

414
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,349
You look sensational.

415
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,751
Thank you.

416
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,853
Is that your kitchen there?

417
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,421
Yeah.

418
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,857
That is one beautiful kitchen.

419
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,292
You did that?

420
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,464
Come. Come see it.

421
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,036
I...

422
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,473
I just realized
I don't know your name.

423
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,508
Scott.

424
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,043
Scott.

425
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,478
Yeah, here.

426
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,219
- Scott...
- Muller.

427
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,689
President of American
School Supplies Company.

428
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:06,692
Very impressive.

429
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,860
Mmm. Nah.

430
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,096
I inherited the whole thing.

431
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,422
Ray!

432
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,091
I'm glad you're here.

433
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,261
Uh, Ray, this is Scott Muller.

434
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,030
This is my famous husband.

435
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,465
Pleasure to meet you.

436
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,667
How do you do?
Scott's here to check us out.

437
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,936
He might want to hire us.

438
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,671
Well, I think
she's just terrific.

439
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,805
You must be very proud.

440
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,674
I am.

441
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,246
Well, I'll leave you two.
I'm gonna circulate in the other rooms.

442
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,348
Nice meeting you.
You too.

443
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:06,685
Where'd you meet that character?

444
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,122
At the market.
He wants to hire a designer.

445
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,158
I'll bet.

446
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,362
Don't tell me I've finally aroused
a little jealousy in you?

447
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:18,497
Oh, stop.

448
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,460
You're a writer
of children's books?

449
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,199
That's right.

450
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:55,534
What about you?

451
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:57,636
School supplies.

452
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,774
What do you want with my wife?
You want to sell her some school supplies?

453
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:09,381
Nah. No, I think your wife
is extremely talented.

454
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,083
Huh.

455
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,052
Why, don't you?

456
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,322
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
That's great.

457
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,560
Well, it seems to me you take
her career pretty lightly.

458
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,864
What makes you think that?

459
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,402
I think it's pretty obvious.

460
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,906
I'll see you around, Davis.

461
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:55,927
Hi? Hello?

462
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,408
- Are you going?

463
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,611
I don't know.

464
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,990
If it's that guy I saw you so eye-to-eye
with last night, I say go for it.

465
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,224
Make an afternoon of it.

466
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,338
Janie, it's purely business.

467
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,340
Right.

468
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,775
I'm serious.

469
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,478
This could be
a very important job for us.

470
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:49,080
This guy's got lots of money.

471
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,684
He inherited some business, school
supplies company or something.

472
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:54,686
Right.

473
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:58,690
Shut up.

474
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,527
Hi.
Hi.

475
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,396
You made it.
Yes.

476
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,897
I think I'm
a little early, actually.

477
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,901
This is a beautiful boat.
It's stunning.

478
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,903
You like it, huh?
Yes.

479
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:20,005
It's not mine, though.

480
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,039
That one's mine!

481
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:27,679
Oh! Boy, I feel stupid.

482
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,948
Why?
I don't know why I thought that was your boat.

483
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:30,749
Here.
I guess you were...

484
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:35,220
Oh, well, this is...
This is a lovely boat.

485
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,455
Well, it's not extravagant,

486
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:38,757
but it's mine.

487
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:42,428
I like it.
Care to come aboard?

488
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,133
I thought this was supposed
to be a business meeting?

489
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,570
Oh, there's no business
to discuss.

490
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,407
You're hired.

491
00:42:56,442 --> 00:43:00,211
Um, $10,000?

492
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,581
Well, I plan to spend
$100,000 so that's 10%.

493
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,553
If you want another five, I'll
send it over in the morning.

494
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,755
Oh. No, no, no,
this is fine.

495
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,023
Thanks. Thanks.

496
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,893

Sorry, should have knocked.

530
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,219
Must be some entry.

531
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,020
What do you mean?

532
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,322
You practically
jumped out of the tub.

533
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:00,759
Did I?

534
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:03,862
Yeah, you did.

535
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:06,765
Where'd you get the sunburn?

536
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,301
We went out on his boat.

537
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:13,171
Whose boat?

538
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,572
Scott's.

539
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,142
I started working for him today.

540
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:21,947
He gave me a $10,000 deposit.

541
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,584
What'd you give him?

542
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,958
I gave him head, of course.
I give all our clients head.

543
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,325
It's in the brochure.
Didn't you know?

544
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,002
Let's take a look
at the famous secret journal.

545
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:45,570
No, Ray!

546
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:49,708
Mick.
Ray. That is mine! It's private!

547
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:51,176
What the hell's in this book?

548
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,378
You got a whole other life?

549
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:55,613
I hope so.

550
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,792
You don't think she's having an affair, do you?
I doubt it.

551
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,627
Mick's not the type.

552
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,162
Then what could it be?
I don't know.

553
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:15,166
She hasn't been the same
since the robbery.

554
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,268
Oh, she's not still hung up on
that guy reading up on her?

555
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:18,670
Well, if she is,
she doesn't talk about it.

556
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:20,338
I never see her anymore,
Marty, she's...

557
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:23,274
She leaves the house early,
she comes home late.

558
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:24,810
Mmm-hmm.
What goes around comes around.

559
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,448
What are you saying?
I had this coming?

560
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,382
I wouldn't go that far.

561
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,287
You're saying I'm not paying
enough attention to my wife?

562
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,122
That's not far enough.

563
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:41,026
Marty, you got something
to say, say it.

564
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:43,929
I can get myself a new
publisher and a new friend.

565
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:46,698
Ray,

566
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,735
you've been on a roll for
the last three, four years,

567
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:52,871
and you are the hottest item in
the children's market today.

568
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:59,344
But you can be the most self-absorbed
asshole in the world sometimes.

569
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,411
And I sure as hell wouldn't
wanna live with you.

570
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,285
Who asked you?

571
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,307
Oh, fuck.

572
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,223
Hi.

573
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,258
Well, come in, come in.
I've been looking forward to this.

574
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:54,232
Well, as you can see,
I need help.

575
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,268
Yeah, but it's great.

576
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,508
Boy, it's a big job
but it's wonderful.

577
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,311
Well, good. I'll get us
some champagne.

578
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:07,946
No! No, today I'm working.

579
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,748
Can I put my jacket in here?

580
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,583
No, wait...

581
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,619
Please... No,
I can take that for you.

582
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,421
Just let me. Here.
Look around.

583
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:29,835
All right. Here's what
I want you to do.

584
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,438
Transform this dungeon,
if you can.

585
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,274
Give it life and order

586
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,177
and make it feel like a
real person lives in here.

587
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,578
Can you do that?

588
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,447
Yeah.

589
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,883
Well, I warn you though, you're
not gonna have any privacy,

590
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,185
I'll be in and out
of here every day.

591
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,319
That I can handle.

592
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,825
And, um, I'll need my own key.

593
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:56,127
You got it.

594
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,528
Here, let me show you my kitchen...
Is that the bedroom?

595
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,169
Yeah, that's...

596
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,471
My bedroom.

597
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:14,045
Well, I guess, uh,

598
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,314
first thing to do is take
down some measurements.

599
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:21,352
Except I can't find...

600
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,288
Do you have one in here?

601
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,023
No, wait. Wait. Don't.

602
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,293
What's that?

603
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:32,197
This?

604
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,035
This is protection.

605
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:39,304
.45 caliber.

606
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,209
Automatic.

607
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:45,510
Wanna hold it?

608
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:49,881
You know you should learn
how to use one of these,

609
00:50:49,915 --> 00:50:51,582
living in this city,

610
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,618
attractive woman like you.

611
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,086
All those crazies out there.

612
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:57,355
You never know.

613
00:50:57,956 --> 00:50:59,390
Go on. Take it.

614
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,327
Go on.
It won't bite you.

615
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,603
You cock it.

616
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,479



617
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:22,647
Don't be afraid of the recoil.

618
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:27,485
Just let your hand
go back naturally.

619
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,623
Try one. Come on.

620
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:37,628
Okay.

621
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,367
There you go.

622
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,701
Hand under here.

623
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,270
Arms straight out.

624
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:47,438
Take a wider stance.

625
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,940
There you go.

626
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:50,375
All right.
There you go.

627
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,110
Okay.

628
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:03,121
Boy, it really
jerks back, doesn't it?

629
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,389
Here.
Let me show you.

630
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:11,696
Good.

631
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,003
Good. One more.
Do it.

632
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,474
Very good.

633
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,810
I'll reload.

634
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:28,213
What a sense of, uh, power.

635
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,422
Okay, this one's all yours.

636
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:43,561
Legs wide apart.

637
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,267
Allow me.
Okay.

638
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,170
And...

639
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,039
Yeah.

640
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,046
Yeah, that's good.

641
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,713
That's good.

642
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:05,450
Yeah.

643
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:08,686
Go on.

644
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:16,594
You're doing great.

645
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,020
What?

646
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,322
Honey, come on.

647
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,291
Come on.
Don't tense up now.

648
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:56,127
Come on, relax.

649
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,329
Enjoy it.

650
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:00,165
I can't.
Sure, you can.

651
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:01,966
You're allowed.
Come on.

652
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,434
Anything you want.

653
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,002
Any way you've ever wanted it.

654
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,671
Any way you ever imagined it.

655
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:08,639
Just let go.

656
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,575
Come on.

657
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,178
Come on.
I'll show you.

658
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,447
Let's go.

659
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,551
Like this.

660
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:21,952
Like this.
Oh.

661
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,454
Oh.

662
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:48,706
Hi.

663
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:49,907
Hi.

664
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:56,914
You're drunk.

665
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,316
You're right.

666
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,253
You worked for Muller
today, didn't you?

667
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,290
That's right.

668
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,260
Why aren't you looking at me?

669
00:57:11,362 --> 00:57:13,631
Because I hate the way you
look when you're drunk.

670
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,900
Where you going, to take a bath?

671
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:18,903
I also hate it
when you're sarcastic.

672
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,173
Ray, let go of me!

673
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,343
Oh, no, not until you give me the
details of your all-day session

674
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:26,844
with that phony son of a bitch!

675
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,347
Why are you acting
so possessive?

676
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,951
Normally, you couldn't care enough
to ask me how I spent my day.

677
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:34,919
Because I trust you.

678
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:39,424
Trust me?
You don't notice me.

679
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:43,694
How can you say that?

680
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:45,430
You're practically the only person
in my life that I didn't make up.

681
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,498
That's my whole point.

682
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,567
Aw, Mick.

683
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:51,936
Really, Ray, I mean,

684
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,205
tell me how you honestly
felt about my kitchen.

685
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,941
Do you remember the colors?

686
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,443
Oh, Mickey, what the hell...
No, do you?

687
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,879
Do you remember if
it was linoleum or tile?

688
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,280
Do you remember the sink?

689
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:05,750
You don't remember it,

690
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:09,186
but you ask me about any one
of your goddamn stories

691
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,522
and I can tell you
every fucking detail!

692
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:13,591
Great. Go tell it
to your holy book.

693
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,360
I wouldn't have to
if I could tell you.

694
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,795
That is so much bullshit!

695
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,798
Every time we get even
close to talking,

696
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,700
you take off and give it all
to your goddamn book!

697
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,405
I can't imagine where
I learned that trick.

698
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,063
All right, man.
I'm going in. You stay here.

699
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:54,865
Scotty, would you relax, huh?

700
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:57,267
Just think of me as
your guardian angel.

701
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:59,269
Let's get it over with.
That was a joke, man.

702
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,538
That was a joke.

703
00:59:02,407 --> 00:59:04,542
Come on.

704
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,242
Shit!

705
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:23,814
(WOMAN TALKING
INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO)

706
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,456
Central, this is MacElwane.
Central!

707
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,091
Central, do you hear me?
It's MacElwane.

708
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,861
There's a robbery in progress at five-nine...

709
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,778
Oh, man, what is
the matter with you?

710
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,980
Why'd you have to kill him?
Left me no choice, man.

711
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,514
He left you no choice?

712
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:59,717
You could have shot the radio!

713
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,985
You could have hit him
over the head.

714
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,152
You could have done anything,
you didn't have to kill him!

715
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:10,728
Oh, God.

716
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:13,598
What am I doing?

717
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,135
What am I doing here?

718
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:56,040
Scott, tell me more about
how your business works.

719
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:00,010
Oh, you don't wanna know that.
That's so boring.

720
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,080
Boring.
No, I'd like to know.

721
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,816
No, let's keep this fun,
let's play a game.

722
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,818
Why are you always
sidestepping that question.

723
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:09,219
No, let's play a game.

724
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:10,755
It's a terrific game,
you're gonna love it.

725
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,761
I guess things about you and we bet
on whether I'm right or wrong.

726
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,665
Try it?
Real money?

727
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:23,333
What do you think?
That's what makes it fun.

728
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,037
Come on, come on,
I bet you 10 bucks

729
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:28,939
I can guess your
favorite radio station.

730
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,843
You're a crazy man.

731
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,616
All right, let's see.

732
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,220
I'll bet you go for that funky little
FM station all the way on the right.

733
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,025
The one that plays
old David Bowie,

734
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,260
Elvis Costello,

735
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,664
Kenny Rogers when he was
with the First Edition.

736
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:56,934
KROJ.
Mmm-hmm.

737
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:00,637
How'd you know that?

738
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:07,144
Double or nothing if I can guess
your political affiliation.

739
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:11,248
I don't think I wanna
play this game anymore, Scott.

740
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,750
You're Republican, Mickey,

741
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,019
because you read
Ayn Rand in college

742
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,088
but you vote Democrat

743
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:19,957
because you think Republicans
are too straight.

744
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,227
How could you possibly
know that?

745
01:04:24,762 --> 01:04:25,896
You really wanna know?

746
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,836
You sure?

747
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:34,872
Yes.

748
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:41,045
I read this article on you
in Designer Scene.

749
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:44,749
I cheated.

750
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,418
Designer Scene?

751
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,089
It's a trade magazine.

752
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,925
Since when do you read
trade magazines?

753
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:59,229
Since I decided that I wanted to
know everything I could about you.

754
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,466
Everything?

755
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,904
Everything.

756
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:14,845
It's crazy, Marty,
I feel so powerless.

757
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:17,147
I suddenly have all these things I
need to tell her and she's not here.

758
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,450
You ever think about
just calling the guy?

759
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:22,286
Just confront him.

760
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:24,755
Yeah, I thought of it.

761
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:26,423
So, what, are you scared?

762
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,493
Yes, I'm scared.

763
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,197
Look, this character,
inside these clothes,

764
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,465
he is straight from the streets.

765
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:37,768
All right, what's the
worst that could happen?

766
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:40,871
You tell him to stay away from
your wife and he kills you.

767
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:43,140
What's the problem?
Yeah, no problem.

768
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,347
If you're convinced the guy is
dangerous, just call the police.

769
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:55,285
Forget the police.
I'll do my own police work.

770
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,093



771
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:07,764
Okay, I know that your
father was a businessman,

772
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:11,501
he was the founder of the
American School Supplies Company.

773
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,238
And your mother,

774
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:19,509
I bet, was a lousy cook
but very into charities.

775
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:21,511
Mmm?

776
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:25,883
You had a brother and a sister,

777
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,318
both younger,

778
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,754
and a dog named Leroy.

779
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:31,889
What? Leroy?

780
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:34,558
Leroy.

781
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:41,866
Uh, you went to school
in a suburb someplace,

782
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,304
and you were a high
school football star,

783
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:50,908
voted "Most Likely to Succeed."

784
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:53,310
Mmm-hmm?

785
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:56,847
No.

786
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,249
No. No what?

787
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:02,486
No football.

788
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:05,422
No high school,

789
01:07:06,957 --> 01:07:09,894
no brother, no sister.

790
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:12,897
No mother,

791
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:15,565
no father,

792
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:18,435
no dog.

793
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:26,944
Well, I was close.

794
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,414
The only thing you need to
know about me right now...

795
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,618
Is this. Is this.

796
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,323
No.

797
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,293
No, I have to know more.

798
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:47,031
Otherwise I feel like
you're hiding something.

799
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,601
Are you hiding something, Scott?

800
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,444
There's your partner.

801
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,050
Don't wanna miss
your appointment.

802
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:08,585
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

803
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:31,041
Hi.

804
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,243
How was my timing?

805
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:36,413
Not good.

806
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,250
What's wrong?

807
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:45,922
I, uh...

808
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,358
I don't know him at all.

809
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,462
He won't tell me
anything about himself.

810
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,132
Maybe he's married.

811
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,136
No, that's not it.

812
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:05,275
He acts like he's had no other
life before I came along.

813
01:09:09,013 --> 01:09:10,647
This whole thing is
beginning to scare me.

814
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:51,521
I'm cold.

815
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:17,747
What's the matter?
What?

816
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,084
Nothin'.

817
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,288
I gotta go take care of
some business right now.

818
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,456
So, uh, give me a call before
you go home, all right.

819
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:30,427
I'll try, um, but
I'm behind on some work.

820
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,528
Just call me!

821
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:34,764
I don't like to be ordered
around like that, Scott.

822
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:36,633
Who you kidding?

823
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,373
I don't know how to say this,

824
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:46,276
but it's all changing...

825
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:48,612
Suddenly.

826
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:52,249
Of course it's changin'.

827
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:53,817
It's supposed to change, Mickey.

828
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,254
I've changed so much since
this whole thing started.

829
01:10:58,488 --> 01:10:59,856
Thanks to you,

830
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,659
I feel like I'm getting a whole
new chance to do it right.

831
01:11:04,194 --> 01:11:06,062
For Christ's sake,
don't back out now.

832
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,601
Don't push me right now, okay?

833
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:14,771
Why?

834
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,207
Why?

835
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:19,809
You don't love that guy.

836
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,279
No, you're wrong, I do love him.

837
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:27,050
We haven't been able to talk
to each other for a long time

838
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,154
and maybe we shouldn't live
together but I do love him.

839
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,841
Ray, do we really
have to do this?

840
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,009
Who's scared now?

841
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,977
I'm not scared, I'm anxious.

842
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,247
I'll drop you at your
analyst's when we're done.

843
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:42,091
What if you're right
and the guy is Joe Street

844
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,593
and he's got a gun?

845
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,662
Just keep an eye on the car and
make sure we don't get too close.

846
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,931
This is great.
I'm riding shotgun with Dr. Seuss.

847
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,634
Where the hell is he going?

848
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,904
Stay back a little ways,
will you?

849
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,340
This Jeep's about as inconspicuous
as a Rose Parade float.

850
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:54,564
Berkeley's vice squad has
made 116 prostitution arrests

851
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,232
during the last
two months of this year,

852
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:58,502
mostly on University Avenue.

853
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,871
The police department spokesman says
the city won't tolerate prostitutes...

854
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:13,683
You know why I'm here.

855
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:15,552
I only got a few minutes.
I need the money from the other night.

856
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:20,390
It is indeed the American
School Supplies Company.

857
01:14:21,891 --> 01:14:23,460
So let's go.

858
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:27,964
Why aren't there any cars?
How should I know?

859
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:30,767
Maybe it's a holiday
for school supply workers.

860
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,936
I'm not that wild about this neighborhood.
Let's just go.

861
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,339
He's coming out.

862
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:56,393
Be right back.
Hey, wait, wait...

863
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:59,463
This is not something you're writing.
This is real.

864
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,598
You could die if you go
walking in a place like that.

865
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,067
You don't know who's in there!

866
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,802
All I'm gonna do is
take a little look around

867
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,371
the old American School
Supplies Company.

868
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:09,773
That's all.

869
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:40,537
Security officer Mike MacElwane,

870
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,672
who retired from the police
department two years ago,

871
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:46,543
was tragically murdered in
Tiburon by unknown assailants.

872
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:49,245
MacElwane was one of the most
highly decorated members

873
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,848
of the police force
in San Francisco history.

874
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,818
And the entire police department
is mourning his death.

875
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:57,454
Top priority has been given
to apprehending his killers

876
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,022
and bringing them to justice.

877
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:12,602
Investigators came up
empty-handed today...

878
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,051
Four small fires
were touched off...

879
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:35,091
...while police and firefighters
searched rooms for a suspect.

880
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:36,926
The fires were confined
to trash cans...

881
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:43,833
Authorities say thefts
of hospital equipment...

882
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:07,851
Jesus!

883
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:21,264
Play detective some other time!
I'm hungry!

884
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,455
Get in the car, Marty.
We gotta find Mick and warn her.

885
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:47,757
What? Warn her? What?

886
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:48,692
There are a couple of our
paintings stashed

887
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:49,793
in that building.
Muller's the thief.

888
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,966
Welcome home, Scotty.

889
01:19:32,736 --> 01:19:34,003
How'd you get in here?

890
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:36,572
Now that's
an interesting question.

891
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,174
We're criminals, remember?

892
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:46,349
What do you want, man?
I'm busy.

893
01:19:49,653 --> 01:19:51,955
I gotta hand it to you, Scott!

894
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,723
This place is fucking beautiful.

895
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:57,593
It's like Disneyland in here!

896
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:01,230
It's got everything.

897
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,068
Did you do this by yourself
or did you have some help?

898
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,772
What's it to you, man?

899
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,807
Well, nothin', it's just nice.

900
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,079
All right, what's your
fuckin' problem?

901
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:18,915
Breaking into my place and pumping
me with dumb fuckin' questions,

902
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:20,349
what's going on?
Let me get to the point.

903
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:21,751
Do that, please.
Okay.

904
01:20:21,785 --> 01:20:23,687
After you left the warehouse
this morning,

905
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,889
I got a visit from someone.

906
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:27,657
Someone named Ray Davis.

907
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:30,126
You know Ray Davis?
Sure you do, huh.

908
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,897
So I said to myself,
"Scotty can't be fucking Ray Davis,

909
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,032
so he's gotta be fucking his old lady."
Aren't you?

910
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,301
You're fucking that little twat.

911
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,436
You motherfucker!
I'll kill you! I'll fucking kill you.

912
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:41,838
You understand?
I'll kill you!

913
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:43,439
Come on, I'll fuckin'...

914
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,608
Hey, motherfucker,
slow way down.

915
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:47,977
Way down!

916
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:49,278
Now, I'm gonna let you
slide on this Davis shit

917
01:20:49,312 --> 01:20:51,080
'cause I think you're sick
in the fuckin' head,

918
01:20:51,114 --> 01:20:52,682
but there's a second
order of business

919
01:20:52,716 --> 01:20:54,050
I think you better
take a good look at.

920
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:56,219
What's that?

921
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:58,487
The old man's got
a friend in the department.

922
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,390
And I got word that they found prints
where we shot that security guard.

923
01:21:01,424 --> 01:21:02,792
How's that grab you?
Well, whose prints, man?

924
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:04,260
I don't leave fuckin' prints!
Yeah?

925
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:06,495
That's you man.
You killed that guy! I didn't!

926
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,197
You ever hear of "accessory"?

927
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:09,933
Check in your fuckin' law books.
We could both do life.

928
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,534
Not me, you understand?

929
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,602
I'm not going back in that fucking place.
You got it?

930
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,739
I'm out of this town
tonight! Yeah.

931
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:18,407
I'm gone, all right!
So get the fuck out!

932
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:22,345
Shoot. Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa!

933
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:25,114
Ooh, I love it when you're
dramatic like that.

934
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:27,416
Hey, you better stop
bullshittin' yourself, man.

935
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:29,953
Nobody dragged you anywhere.

936
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,424
Man, you don't belong up in credit
card heaven with those assholes.

937
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,425
Don't you know that, man?

938
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:39,929
You belong down here with us.

939
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:41,030
That's who you are.

940
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,168
So be smart.
Take a look at this place.

941
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:46,903
You ain't got no money left.

942
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,975
One more good score and then we
both walk outta here tomorrow

943
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,709
with some change in our pocket.

944
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,444
That's smart, okay?

945
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,149
You got my number.
I'll wait for your call.

946
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:10,259
Oh, Scotty, bullshit aside...
Fuckin' nice joint.

947
01:22:22,806 --> 01:22:23,973
Sweeney, could we speed this up?

948
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:25,842
I'm a little worried about my wife.
All right.

949
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:29,378
Take it easy, we just can't go
rushing out arresting people.

950
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:30,947
There are procedures
we have to follow.

951
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,782
Screw your procedures.
This guy's a criminal!

952
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:34,350
We don't know what he'll do.
He could kill her!

953
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:36,219
Will you relax?
You still gotta sign this complaint.

954
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,821
Fuck the complaint!
Thanks for all your help.

955
01:22:37,854 --> 01:22:39,823
Hey wait a minute!
Where you going?

956
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,199
Come on.

957
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:56,205
Come on, come on, come on.

958
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,852
Who is it?
Mickey, it's me, it's Scott, let me up.

959
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:15,224
Scott, I'm working.

960
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:17,827
Mickey, I gotta talk to you.
Let me up.

961
01:23:21,865 --> 01:23:23,299
Come on! Come on! Come on!

962
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,142
Okay.

963
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,289
You didn't call, did you?

964
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,791
Scott, I thought
I made it clear...

965
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:50,326
I need a drink.
Can I fix myself...

966
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,129
Mickey, I know
what you said in the car.

967
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:55,064
Something's come up.

968
01:23:55,098 --> 01:23:57,433
I gotta leave town right away.
I want you with me.

969
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,536
What are you saying?

970
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:03,506
I swear to you, you'll love it.

971
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,043
We'll live on the boat, we'll go
from city to city, just you and me.

972
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:31,968
What the fuck you lookin' at?

973
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:36,639
I don't know you.

974
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:42,611
Of course you know me.

975
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:47,383
You know me.

976
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,986
You know me better than
anyone has ever known me.

977
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:52,221
Believe me.
And you know what?

978
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:54,023
I know you.

979
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:59,628
I know you like no one
has ever known you,

980
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:01,430
don't I, baby? Hmm?

981
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:08,037
Don't I, Michelle?

982
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:12,175
What?
Oh, you heard me.

983
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:16,779
What are you saying?
Come on, Mrs. Davis.

984
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,014
You want me to
quote from the book?

985
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:19,082
Is that what you want, huh?
No.

986
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:20,316
I got a juicy one.

987
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:26,122
"I'm all alone.
There's a knocking at the door. It's him.

988
01:25:26,155 --> 01:25:28,091
I call for him to leave but he won't.

989
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:29,959
He just keeps pounding
and pounding..."

990
01:25:29,993 --> 01:25:31,527
No!
"And he's gonna come in..."

991
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,963
No!
"He takes me, throws me
down on the floor..."

992
01:25:33,997 --> 01:25:37,433
No! You bastard!

993
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,903
You lowlife bastard!
You're sick!

994
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:43,406
Oh, I'm sick, huh?
What's that make you?

995
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,274
You wrote that shit
in those books, not me.

996
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:49,178
You lied!
You invented this whole person!

997
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:53,449
I invented it?
You invented me, lady!

998
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,584
You begged me to come into
your life and make it all right

999
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:57,720
and that's what I did.

1000
01:25:57,753 --> 01:26:00,423
I did everything you ever
wanted a man to do for you.

1001
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:01,290
Everything.

1002
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:03,292
Look at me!

1003
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:05,161
I love you.

1004
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:13,569
I never loved anyone
before in my life!

1005
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:14,737
I never even came close.

1006
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:20,109
This has got to stop.
No!

1007
01:26:20,143 --> 01:26:21,844
No, please! No!

1008
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,812
We'll stop when I say stop!
No!

1009
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,081
What's it gonna take, huh?

1010
01:26:25,114 --> 01:26:27,450
You want me to remind you, huh?

1011
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:29,318
- You want me to remind you
what it was like, huh?
- No.

1012
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:32,055
Hmm? What it was like?

1013
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:34,123
Ray!
Muller!

1014
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,159
You son of a bitch!

1015
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:38,627
Stop!

1016
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,131
Come on!
You want more?
Come on!

1017
01:26:42,165 --> 01:26:43,599
- Come on! I'll give you more!
- No!

1018
01:26:46,602 --> 01:26:50,973
Oh, that's beautiful.
Just beautiful, Mickey.

1019
01:26:51,006 --> 01:26:53,276
You wanna live with that the rest
of your life, Mickey, go ahead!

1020
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:56,545
Come on, be smart.

1021
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:59,682
You poor sick bastard.

1022
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,217
Oh, shut up, man, shut up!

1023
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,519
Do you even know
this woman?

1024
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:05,321
You know how far she
went in those journals?

1025
01:27:06,589 --> 01:27:07,556
I'll tell you.

1026
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:11,494
"One day he comes for me and I go.

1027
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,032
I leave my safe, safe
existence and I just go."

1028
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:19,635
I wrote that a long time ago.

1029
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,272
It's not true.

1030
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:27,643
It's not true.

1031
01:27:33,316 --> 01:27:35,118
I don't believe that.

1032
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,072
Oh, Ray.

1033
01:27:58,707 --> 01:27:59,775
I'm sorry.

1034
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:07,783
I'm sorry too.


1035
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,349
I talked to the police.

1036
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:15,718
He's gone.

1037
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,288
Good.

1038
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:42,345
Ray...

1039
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:49,518
I've decided that I'm gonna
stop writing in the journal.

1040
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,525
And all the things I used
to write, can I say to you?

1041
01:29:58,861 --> 01:29:59,795
Of course you can.

1042
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,269
All I ever wanted was to be
the best friend you ever had.

1043
01:30:09,305 --> 01:30:11,407
And I got so caught up in
my work, I forgot that.

1044
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:46,409
You were really something yesterday.


1045
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:48,311
The way you came charging in.

1046
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:50,012
Dr. Seuss to the rescue.

1047
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,718
I'm sorry I wasn't the dashing
figure I imagined myself to be.

1048
01:30:57,286 --> 01:30:59,455
You were very dashing.

1049
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:32,821
What a goof.

1050
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:35,190
You got a real jones,
don't you, you sick fuck.

1051
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:35,958
Just get the fuck out of here.

1052
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:38,026
You leave these people alone.

1053
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:43,666
Scotty, you leave
these people alone.

1054
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:44,767
You're the one
who's got a problem.

1055
01:31:45,968 --> 01:31:46,935
I'm just doing my job.

1056
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:56,011
I said get out of here, man.

1057
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:00,616
Well, well, well.

1058
01:32:02,485 --> 01:32:04,319
What did you find here, Scott?

1059
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:05,921
Was it what you thought
it was gonna be?

1060
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,791
Was it worth it?

1061
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:18,934
You wouldn't understand
in a million years.

1062
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:22,371
Well, help me understand!
Explain it to me.

1063
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:25,408
I'm listening.

1064
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:31,980
I got nothing more
to say to you.

1065
01:32:36,318 --> 01:32:37,886
Then stay out of my way.

1066
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:44,960
I said leave these people alone!

1067
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:34,409
Jesus, he's back!

1068
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:36,111
Call the police.

1069
01:33:38,681 --> 01:33:39,748
What are you going to do?

1070
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:41,216
I'm gonna stop
the son of a bitch.

1071
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:43,018
Just call the police.
Call them!

1072
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:57,900
This is Mrs. Davis at 3080 Seacliff Drive.

1073
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:00,936
There's somebody
robbing our house.

1074
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,905
Yes. Please hurry.

1075
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,119
Stop right there.
It's all over!

1076
01:34:19,522 --> 01:34:21,924
Drop it. Drop it!

1077
01:34:24,126 --> 01:34:25,127
I'll shoot!

1078
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:46,649
Better not touch anything.

1079
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,888
I don't remember
pulling the trigger.

1080
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:28,190
Dead, huh?
Take some pictures here.

1081
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:35,130
All right, let's see
what we got here.

1082
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:43,071
Well, there's your problem.

1083
01:35:44,973 --> 01:35:45,874
Buddy?

1084
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,558
You're hurt.

1085
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:14,803
You did it.

1086
01:36:17,072 --> 01:36:18,173
You shot him.

1087
01:36:32,154 --> 01:36:33,055
