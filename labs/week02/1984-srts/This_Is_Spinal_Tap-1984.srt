1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,271
Hello. My name is Marty DiBergi.

2
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:24,899
I'm a filmmaker.
I make a lot of commercials.

3
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:29,904
That dog that chases the covered wagon
underneath the sink? That was mine.

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,533
In 1966,

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:38,413
I went down to Greenwich Village
to a rock club called The Electric Banana.

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,417
Don't look for it. It's not there any more.
But that night, I heard a band

7
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,754
that, for me,
redefined the word "rock'n'roll".

8
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:53,094
I remember being knocked out by their...
their exuberance, their raw power,

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,388
and their punctuality.

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:59,267
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

11
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:06,691
17 years and 15 albums later,
Spinal Tap is still going strong.

12
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:12,405
And they've earned a place in rock history
as one of England's loudest bands.

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,157
So in the late fall of 1982,

14
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:19,453
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell The Glove

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,958
and was planning a tour of the US
to promote that album,

16
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:27,878
I jumped at the chance
to make the documentary,

17
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:32,466
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you're about to see.

18
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:38,097
I wanted to capture the sights,
the sounds, the smells

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,350
of a hard-working rock band on the road.

20
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,519
And I got that.

21
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,437
But I got more.

22
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,815
A lot more.

23
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,027
But enough of my yakkin'.
Whaddaya say? Let's boogie.

24
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,997
Gives me energy. Makes me happy.

25
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,874
Heavy metal's deep.

26
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,085
The way they dress, the leather.

27
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:13,382
- Is this La Guardia?
- No, this is JFK. New York, New York.

28
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,513
Watch its mouth!

29
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:36,530
It's like you become one with the guys
in the band. I mean, there's no division.

30
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,615
You just...

31
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:43,662
The music just unites people...
with the players.

32
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:48,291
Comin' live, direct from hell... Spinal Tap!

33
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,837
You're hot, you take all we've got.
Not a dry seat in the house

34
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,924
Next day we'll be on our way

35
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,510
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

36
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,096
- Yeah, tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

37
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:02,555
Tonight!

38
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:12,524
We are Spinal Tap from the UK!
You must be the USA!

39
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:19,656
DAVID ST HUBBINS
Lead Guitar

40
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:24,661
NIGEL TUFNEL
Lead Guitar

41
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:30,124
DEREK SMALLS
Bass

42
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,796
MICK SHRIMPTON

43
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,716
VIV SAVAGE
Keyboards

44
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:44,472
Little girl, it's a great big world
but there's only one of

45
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,101
Me!

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,873
Let's talk about your history.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,338
Nigel, you and David originally started
the band back in... when was it, 1964?

48
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:21,592
Before that I was in a group
called The Creatures-a skiffle group.

49
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,762
I was in Lovely Lads,
and then we looked at each other

50
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:28,182
and said we might as well join up,
you know?

51
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:33,395
So we became The Originals.
And we had to change our name.

52
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:36,649
There was another group
called The Originals

53
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:40,319
- And we had to rename ourselves.
- The New Originals.

54
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:44,448
- Then they became...
- They changed back to The Regulars,

55
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:48,202
so we could've been The Originals,
but what's the point?

56
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,746
We became
The Thames Men at that point.

57
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,999
Stop wastin' my time

58
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,085
"POP, LOOK & LISTEN"
(British TV - 1965)

59
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,253
You know what I want

60
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,673
You know what I need

61
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:05,010
Or maybe you don't

62
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:11,433
Do I have to come right flat out
and tell you everythin'?

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,977
Gimme some money

64
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:17,481
Gimme some money

65
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,156
Your first drummer was...

66
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:29,701
- The Peeper.
- John "Stumpy" Pepys. Great, great...

67
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:32,913
Tall, blond geek with glasses.

68
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:37,209
- Good drummer.
- Great look. Good drummer.

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,753
- What happened to him?
- He died.

70
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,632
He died in a bizarre gardening accident
some years back.

71
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,800
It was one of those things.

72
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,136
It was... the authorities said

73
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:52,265
best leave it, you know, unsolved,
really, you know?

74
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:56,227
- And he was replaced by?
- Stumpy Joe. Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.

75
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,772
And what happened to Stumpy Joe?

76
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:01,483
Well, it's not a very pleasant story.

77
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,861
- But, er... he died.
- He passed on.

78
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:11,618
He choked on... The official explanation
was he choked on vomit.

79
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:16,873
- And he passed away.
- It was actually someone else's vomit.

80
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,042
There's no real...

81
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,461
They can't prove whose vomit it was.

82
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,506
They don't have facilities
in Scotland Yard.

83
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:27,008
You can't really dust for vomit.

84
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:30,053
Here we go.

85
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,932
- SoHo, they call this. SoHo.
- So-what?

86
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:40,063
OPENING NIGHT PARTY
New York City

87
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,982
How are you?!

88
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,402
Ian... Hi, fellas!

89
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,321
How ya doin'?

90
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,531
I want you to meet everybody.

91
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:52,700
- Bobbi Flekman.
- Who's that?

92
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:56,954
- Bobbi Flekman.
- Who is it? With the record company?

93
00:06:57,121 --> 00:07:01,501
Yes, Bobbi Flekman!
The hostess with the mostest!

94
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,461
You know! You know!

95
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:06,297
Hi, handsome. How ya doin'?

96
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:10,885
I want you to all meet Sir Denis
Eton-Hogg. He's the head of Polymer.

97
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,096
You don't talk so much.
Just smile and look smart.

98
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:16,766
Denis, come here! Come here.

99
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:19,685
I want you to meet Spinal Tap,
our guests of honour.

100
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:22,980
- How very nice to meet you.
- This is Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

101
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:27,735
- This is Nigel.
- Thanks a lot for letting us... er...

102
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,988
Let's go over here
and we'll take a picture.

103
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:35,993
Where's my photographer? Come here,
honey. What's your name? Christine?

104
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,913
OK, right over here.

105
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,290
Good! Good!

106
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:45,169
- He's not into Negro music.
- No, it's not Negro.

107
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:49,715
Guys, you look fantastic.
You would never know you're almost 40.

108
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:52,968
If I looked this good
from the stage, too-it's amazing.

109
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,970
- I did the bird.
- Do the dead bird.

110
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,889
Get the dwarf cannolies.

111
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:00,851
- I did the bird.
- Don't talk back. Mime is money. Move it!

112
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:04,980
Now, we here at Polymer,
we're all looking forward to a long

113
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:08,150
and fruitful relationship with Spinal Tap.

114
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:12,321
We wish them great success
on their North American tour.

115
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:17,201
And so say all of us - Tap into America!

116
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:26,043
Excuse me.
Are you reading Yes, I Can?

117
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,087
- Yeah. Have you read it?
- Yeah. By Sammy Davis, Jr?

118
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,130
Yeah.

119
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:32,883
You know what the title
of that book should be?

120
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,095
Yes, I Can... If Frank Sinatra Says It's OK.

121
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,556
Cos Frank calls the shots
for all those guys.

122
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:43,935
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's comin' outta The Copa,

123
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:47,981
and it's about three o'clock
in the morning, and he sees Frank.

124
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:51,193
Frank's walkin' down Broadway
by himself...

125
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,864
Fuckin' limeys.

126
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,326
Well, they're not used to that world,
and Frank Sinatra.

127
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:01,828
It's a different world that they're in.

128
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:06,958
You know, it's just people like this,
you know... They get all they want,

129
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,587
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

130
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:14,049
You know, when you've loved and lost
the way Frank has,

131
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,384
then you know what life's about.

132
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,595
The New York Times may do something.

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,472
IAN FAITH
Manager, Spinal Tap

134
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,141
When do we get the album released?

135
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,810
It doesn't matter how good the press is...

136
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:30,899
As I explained last night, we're not gonna
saturate the New York market.

137
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:33,985
Now, Philly is a real rock'n'roll town.

138
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:38,740
The album will be available
all through the Philadelphia area.

139
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:41,618
So you are hitting that market...

140
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:44,829
We're certainly...
I'm doing everything I can.

141
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:47,248
You know that we're not blaming you.

142
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,959
But these guys have
an effect on an audience.

143
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,795
Kids go to their concert,
have a great time.

144
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,090
But it's... It's a passing thing. It's, uh...

145
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:02,513
I would never tell them this,
but this is a... this is a fad.

146
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,860
FIDELITY HALL
Philadelphia

147
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:28,497
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushin'

148
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:29,915
That's what I said

149
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:36,547
The looser the waistband,
the deeper the quicksand

150
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,883
Or so I have read

151
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:45,389
My baby fits me like a flesh tuxedo

152
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:49,685
I'd like to sink her with my pink torpedo

153
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,979
Big bottom

154
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,981
Big bottom

155
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:57,693
Talk about bum cakes, my girl's got 'em

156
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,031
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind

157
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:06,493
How could I leave this behind?

158
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,837
I met her on Monday,
'twas my lucky bun day

159
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,797
You know what I mean

160
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:25,888
I love her each weekday,
each velvety cheek day

161
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,848
You know what I mean

162
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:33,687
My love gun's loaded
and she's in my sights

163
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:38,650
Big game is waiting there
inside her tights, yeah

164
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,485
Big bottom

165
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:42,738
Big bottom

166
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:46,366
Talk about mud flaps, my girl's got 'em

167
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,662
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind

168
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,834
How could I leave this behind?

169
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:07,220
Let's talk about your reviews,
regarding Intravenus de Milo.

170
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,891
"This tasteless cover is a good indication
of the lack of musical invention within."

171
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:15,770
"The musical growth rate of this band
cannot even be charted."

172
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:19,691
"They're treading water in a sea
of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

173
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,151
That's nit-picking.

174
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,486
The Gospel According To Spinal Tap.

175
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:27,323
"This pretentious, ponderous collection
of religious rock psalms

176
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,576
is enough to prompt the question,

177
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:32,704
what day did the Lord create Spinal Tap,

178
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:35,915
and couldn't he have rested
on that day, too?"

179
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:38,626
I never heard that one. That's a good one.

180
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:44,257
The review on Shark Sandwich, which
was merely a two-word review, just said:

181
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,926
"Shit sandwich."

182
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:51,097
- Where did that appear?
- That's not real, is it?

183
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,307
RECORDING INDUSTRY CONVENTION
Atlanta, Georgia

184
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:57,770
All those arguments about touring...
We belong on tour.

185
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:02,316
All that stuff about you being
too old and being too white...

186
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:06,612
What about the album, Ian?
This is beginning to be a refrain here.

187
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,449
There's no way
to promote something that doesn't exist.

188
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:14,871
It's just that they're
just experimenting with, er,

189
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,290
with new packaging materials.

190
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:20,167
Experimenting?
They got monkeys opening it?

191
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:23,796
The other thing is
that the Boston gig has been cancelled.

192
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:27,258
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's not a big college town.

193
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,930
You boys got an album
coming out or anything?

194
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,516
Smell The Glove. It should be out...

195
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,227
- Smell The Glove?
- Smell The Glove, yeah.

196
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:41,856
- Provocative title.
- Wait till you see the cover.

197
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,732
Very provocative indeed.

198
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,528
Bobbi, can I tear you away from all this?

199
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,531
- Do you have a drink?
- I don't really need one.

200
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:54,827
But, um, listen. I really do have to
talk to you a bit about this...

201
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:57,246
Ian, just tell me what's on your mind.

202
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,415
- The issue of the cover.
- Yeah.

203
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:03,752
Um... we, er, I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be fact,

204
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,172
that the company's rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

205
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:09,341
- Yes.
- You can give it to me straight.

206
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:11,802
Listen... they don't like the cover.

207
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:15,556
- Well, that's straight.
- They find it offensive and sexist.

208
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,433
What do you find offensive?

209
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,813
Ian, you put a greased,
naked woman on all fours

210
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,149
with a dog collar around her neck
and a leash,

211
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,403
and a man's arm extended out up to here

212
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,700
holding onto the leash and pushing
a black glove in her face to sniff it.

213
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,703
You don't find that offensive and sexist?

214
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:40,414
- This is 1982!
- That's right, it's 1982.

215
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,458
We don't have this mentality any more.

216
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,753
You should've seen the cover
they wanted to do!

217
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,631
This is something you have to talk about.

218
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:54,803
- We're not laying down any conditions...
- A sexy cover isn't why an album sells.

219
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,889
You tell me - The White Album?
What was that?

220
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:00,475
There was nothing
on that goddamn cover.

221
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,645
Excuse me. We'll talk about this after.

222
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,939
Hello?

223
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,108
Oh, hi, Denis.

224
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:12,404
Uh-uh. OK.
Why don't you tell him?

225
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:17,325
OK, hold on. Ian, it's Eton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

226
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:20,996
- OK. Thank you, darling.
- You're welcome... dear.

227
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,665
Hello? Sir Denis!

228
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,917
Hi. How are you?

229
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,796
Oh...

230
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:33,758
Fuckin' old poofter!

231
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,680
But it's really not that offensive,
Sir Denis! Come on!

232
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:42,100
OK. I'll call you
absolutely first thing in the morning.

233
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:47,939
Oh, shit!
They're not gonna release the album,

234
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:51,567
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

235
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:55,196
So what? What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

236
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,031
Sex-ist!

237
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,242
OK, I wanted to tell you this,

238
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,079
but I didn't know
what Denis's decision was going to be.

239
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,998
But at this point,
both Sears and K-Mart stores

240
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,586
won't handle the album. They're
boycotting it because of the cover.

241
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:14,590
If the company is behind an album,
it can shove it down their throats!

242
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,301
Money talks and bullshit walks.

243
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:21,597
And if the first album was a hit,
then we could have told them...

244
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:26,018
- Every cut on this album...
- I don't give a shit...

245
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,021
It was a joke
and they're making it a big deal.

246
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,609
If we said she should be forced
to smell the glove,

247
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:36,987
then you'd have a point.
But it's all a joke.

248
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:40,741
- We're making fun of it.
- She should be made to smell it.

249
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,993
But not over and over.

250
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,998
We can work something out. I'll talk to
Denis and maybe we can compromise.

251
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,668
A new design concept
we can all live with.

252
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,714
- You guys were schoolmates?
- We... We're not university material.

253
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,800
- What's on your finger?
- My gum.

254
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,803
- Why is it on your finger?
- I might need it later.

255
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,765
- Put it on the table. It's terrible.
- I might forget it on the table.

256
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:08,310
- Can't take him anywhere!
- How old were you guys when you met?

257
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:11,355
About eight years old. Eight or nine.

258
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:15,693
- You were eight and I was seven.
- That's right.

259
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,571
Do you remember
the first song you wrote together?

260
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,948
All The Way Home.

261
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,950
- All The Way Home?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:26,120
Can you remember it?
I'd love to hear it.

263
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:29,331
Christ! Some black coffee,
maybe we could do it.

264
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,542
How's it go?

265
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:35,170
- I was standin'
- Beside the railroad track

266
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,549
And I'm waitin' for that train
to bring you back

267
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,969
Bring you back

268
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:46,765
If she's...
If she's not on the 5.19

269
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,309
Then I'm gonna
know what sorrow means

270
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:52,729
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry,
all the way home

271
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,149
- All the way home
- All the way home

272
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,402
- All the way home
- All the way home

273
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:02,989
- Cry... cry, cry, all the way home.
- Cry, cry, cry, all the way home.

274
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,452
There was about six words in it.
Just repeating them over and over again.

275
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,871
Let's talk about your music today.

276
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,626
One thing that puzzles me, um,
is the make-up of your audience.

277
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:19,589
It seems to be predominantly young boys.

278
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,466
Well, it's a sexual thing.

279
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,011
Aside from
the identifying that the boys do with us,

280
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:29,182
there's also, like,
a reaction of the female to our music.

281
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,684
Really, they're quite fearful.

282
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:35,647
They see us onstage with tight trousers...

283
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,525
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

284
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,152
It's really quite frightening, the size.

285
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,738
And... and they run screaming.

286
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,618
VANDERMINT AUDITORIUM
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

287
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,162
Ian, can I have a word with you?

288
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,331
Yes, of course. What?

289
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:58,544
There are a couple of problems
with the arrangements backstage.

290
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:02,048
- What exactly?
- Well, there are some problems here.

291
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,425
I don't even know where to start.

292
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:07,970
- Sound check? What?
- No, no, no, no. This. Look.

293
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,807
There's a problem with... Look. This.

294
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,478
This miniature bread. I've been working
with this for about half an hour.

295
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:19,857
I can't figure out... Let's say
I want a bite, right? You got this...

296
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,944
- You'd like bigger bread?
- Exactly! I don't understand...

297
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,654
You could fold this.

298
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,199
- Then it's half the size.
- Not the bread. You fold the meat.

299
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:32,870
- Then it breaks apart like this.
- No, you put it on the bread like this.

300
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,082
- But if you fold it, it breaks.
- Why fold it?

301
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:38,376
Everything has to be folded.

302
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:44,673
And then it's this, and I don't want this.
I want large bread, so that I can put this...

303
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:50,471
So then it's like this,
but this doesn't work because it's all...

304
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,181
Because it hangs out?

305
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:56,352
- Would you hold this?
- I wouldn't want to put that in my mouth.

306
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,813
And then we move on to this. Look! Look!

307
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,901
Who's in here? No one.
Then in here, there's a little guy.

308
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,945
It's a complete catastrophe!

309
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,989
You're right, Nigel,
but calm down, calm down.

310
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,659
- It's no big deal. It's a joke.
- I'm sorry.

311
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:14,078
It's just some cracker university.

312
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,955
I don't want it to affect your performance.

313
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:20,334
It won't affect my performance.
Don't worry.

314
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:25,422
I just hate it. It does disturb me.
But I'll rise above it. I'm a professional.

315
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:33,096
It's better in a hellhole

316
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,100
You know where you stand in a hellhole

317
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,355
Folks lend a hand in a hellhole

318
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,776
Girl, get me back to my hellhole

319
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:41,873
Do Stonehenge!

320
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,710
Do you play...
Do you actually play all these?

321
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:48,213
I play them and I cherish them.

322
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,131
This is at the top of the heap.

323
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:53,426
No question about it.
Look at the flame on that one.

324
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:56,596
It's just... It's quite unbelievable.

325
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:01,184
This one is just... It's perfect, 1959.

326
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:03,227
You know, it just... Listen.

327
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,438
- How much...
- Just listen.

328
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:09,108
- The sustain-listen to it.
- I'm not hearing anything.

329
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:13,738
You would if it were playing.
Because it's famous for its sustain.

330
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:17,200
- You can just hold it...
- So you don't...

331
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:21,204
You can go and have a bite
and you'd still be hearing that one.

332
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,331
- Can you hold this a sec?
- Sure.

333
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:26,918
This one... This, of course,
is a custom three pick-up.

334
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,253
This is my radio unit.

335
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:34,383
So I strap this piece on
right down in here when I'm onstage.

336
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,969
- It's a wireless.
- Wireless. Exactly.

337
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:41,265
- I can play without all the muck.
- You can run anywhere onstage with it.

338
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:44,101
This is special, too. Look, see?

339
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:47,313
It's still got the tagger on it.
Never even played it.

340
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,648
- You just bought it...
- Don't touch it.

341
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,609
I wasn't gonna touch it.

342
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:54,278
- I was just pointing at it.
- Don't point.

343
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,490
- Don't even point?
- No. It can't be played. Never.

344
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:00,326
- Can I look at it?
- No. You've seen enough.

345
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:02,620
This is what we use onstage.

346
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:06,499
But it's very, very special
because, if you can see,

347
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:09,668
the numbers all go to 11.

348
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:13,547
Look. Right across the board.
11... 11... 11...

349
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,383
- And most amps go up to ten?
- Exactly.

350
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:21,096
- Does that mean it's louder?
- Well, it's one louder, isn't it?

351
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:25,225
It's not ten. See, most blokes
are gonna be playing at ten.

352
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:28,437
You're on ten here,
all the way up, all the way up.

353
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:32,483
You're on ten-where can you go
from there? Where?

354
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,651
- I don't know.
- Nowhere. Exactly!

355
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:39,156
If we need that extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

356
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:41,909
- Put it up to 11.
- Exactly. One louder.

357
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:45,704
Why don't you make ten louder,
make ten the top number,

358
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,540
and make that a little louder?

359
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,668
These go to 11.

360
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,837
Are you Spinal Tap?

361
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:56,298
- This is Spinal Tap.
- Welcome to Memphis.

362
00:23:56,465 --> 00:24:00,510
- Gentlemen, we have a slight problem.
- How slight?

363
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:03,347
- You wanted seven suites.
- Seven suites.

364
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:06,516
He's put you on
the 7th floor with one suite.

365
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:09,186
That's considerably more than minor.

366
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:12,814
But it's a good-sized room.
It's a king leisure.

367
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,151
How are we going to get 14 people
in a king leisure bed?

368
00:24:16,318 --> 00:24:18,528
- Don't tempt me, sir.
- Have a good time.

369
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,364
- I'll take care of it.
- Welcome, gentlemen.

370
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,658
- Very attractive...
- Listen to me!

371
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:27,954
We want these suites. These people are
tired. We've a sound check in an hour.

372
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:30,457
- What's the problem?
- Give me a hand, please.

373
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:34,711
I'll tell you what's wrong.
This twisted old fruit here

374
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:37,714
- Tells me that...
- I'm just as God made me, sir.

375
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:40,967
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

376
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,970
Uh-oh, here they come.

377
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:46,639
Duke! Duke! Would you...

378
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:50,018
Can I have your autograph?

379
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:53,438
Duke. It's OK, we know him.
It's Spinal Tap.

380
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,940
- David St Hubbins, Spinal Tap.
- How ya doin'?

381
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:57,567
Derek Smalls.

382
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,820
- We gotta get going.
- Where are you playin'?

383
00:25:00,987 --> 00:25:05,241
We're doin' the... Enormo Dome.
We sold it out.

384
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:07,994
That's a big place. You sold it out?!

385
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:10,580
We really should run, you know.

386
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:15,126
Good heavens! How are you?
Great to see you, Ter.

387
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,378
- Um... Liam!
- Ian.

388
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:18,921
Ian!

389
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:23,718
We'd love to chat, but we gotta sit
in the lobby and wait for the limo.

390
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,679
- OK.
- Great to see you again, Terry.

391
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,307
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

392
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,392
Great. Great to see you.

393
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,812
- Good days. Good days.
- Nice to see you.

394
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:37,440
Fuckin' wanker. What a wanker.

395
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:40,860
He's got this much talent.
This much if he's lucky.

396
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:43,696
We had to apologise for him with our set.

397
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:47,450
People were still booin' him
when we were on. It's all hype.

398
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:51,329
- We got our rooms. Big fat suites.
- Can I ask you something?

399
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:54,665
Have you seen
Duke Fame's current album?

400
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:57,251
- Um... yes.
- You've seen the cover?

401
00:25:57,418 --> 00:26:00,546
- No, I don't think I have.
- It's a rather lurid cover.

402
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:03,632
It's, like, naked women and...

403
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,929
He's tied down to this table and they've
got whips and they're all semi-nude.

404
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:12,766
- What's your point?
- It's much worse than Smell The Glove.

405
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,436
He releases that and he's number three.

406
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:19,982
But he's the victim. Their objections
were that she was the victim.

407
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:22,735
If the singer's the victim, it's not sexist.

408
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:26,613
- He did a twist on it.
- We should've thought of that.

409
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,742
If we'd had you guys tied up,
that would've been fine.

410
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:33,620
It's such a fine line between stupid and...

411
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,040
- And clever.
- It's just that turnabout.

412
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:39,752
I have a piece of bad news.
Although it may not be that bad.

413
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:42,921
We're, er... we're cancelled here.

414
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,425
- At the hotel?
- No, the gig is cancelled.

415
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:47,968
Fuck!

416
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:52,973
"Memphis show cancelled
due to lack of advertising funds."

417
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:59,187
The last time Tap toured America, they
were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas

418
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:03,942
and 15,000-seat venues. And it seems
that now, on the current tour,

419
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:08,655
they're being booked into
1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.

420
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:13,118
I was wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

421
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:16,580
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, not at all.

422
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:21,710
I just think that... that their appeal
is becoming more selective.

423
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,630
I notice you got this cricket bat here.

424
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:29,718
- Do you play?
- No. I carry this partly out of...

425
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:32,554
I don't know. Sort of...

426
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,474
- I suppose... What's the word?
- Affectation?

427
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,769
Yes. It's a kind of totemistic thing,
you know.

428
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:43,898
To be frank, it's come in useful
in a couple of situations.

429
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:47,110
Certainly in the
topsy-turvy world of heavy rock.

430
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:52,157
Having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often... useful.

431
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:54,325
I miss you too, darling.

432
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:56,870
Um, not too well, actually.

433
00:27:57,036 --> 00:28:00,707
We got to Memphis
and there's no gig in Memphis.

434
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:04,210
And we find out
this promoter in the Midwest

435
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:07,672
has pulled out of St Louis
and Kansas City,

436
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,091
and, um,

437
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,051
oh, Des Moines.

438
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:14,512
I don't know. It's in Indiana or something.

439
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:18,850
I thought...

440
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:22,061
Oh, don't tease me. That's not until April.

441
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:26,399
Great! We'll do it! Oh, fuckin' great!

442
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:30,111
Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

443
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:33,156
I have no idea.
You might have to fly to New York

444
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:36,742
and then go to Milwaukee from there.

445
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,203
Oh, God, I love you too!

446
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,164
OK. Bye.

447
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:48,004
Well, my problems are solved, mate.
Jeanine, she's gonna come meet us.

448
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:54,051
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Khyatt's boutique, but...

449
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:57,972
- Is she coming to drop some stuff off?
- No, she's coming on the road.

450
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:01,684
She's gonna travel with us.
She's gonna go on the road with us.

451
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:05,146
She says she can hear that
I'm eating too much sugar on the phone.

452
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:07,440
She says my larynx is fat.

453
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:12,736
You might want to come next door.
The radio's playing a bit of your past.

454
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:15,906
Are you happy for me?

455
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:23,455
- I don't believe it!
- Just have a listen, man.

456
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:31,171
How sad it must end
but I'm glad I've a friend

457
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:34,299
Sharing cups and cakes with me

458
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:39,847
And cakes with me

459
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:43,350
Oh, yeah! Goin' all the way back to 1965!

460
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:48,480
Doesn't it feel good with
The Thames Men and "Cups & Cakes"?

461
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:53,235
The Thames Men later became Spinal Tap
and had a couple of nice-sized hits.

462
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:56,321
They're currently in the
"Where Are They Now?" file.

463
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:59,157
Johnny Q with you on Golden 106,
and right after we...

464
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:04,454
I'm not sure this was a good idea.
I don't feel any better.

465
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,456
GRACELAND
Memphis, Tennessee

466
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:11,420
He was gonna do a TV special
from here before he died.

467
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:15,132
Yeah, a musical version
of Somebody Up There Likes Me.

468
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:20,929
Well, since my baby left me

469
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:23,890
I found a new place to dwell

470
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:26,768
Well, it's down at the end
of Lonely Street

471
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,980
At Heartbreak Hotel

472
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:32,732
- Do it with the harmony parts.
- All right.

473
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,609
Well, since my baby

474
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:36,861
The same key, though, I think.

475
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:39,281
Well, since my baby left me

476
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:43,326
If I'm going:
Since my baby left me

477
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,454
- Me
- No, you can't hit that note.

478
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:50,166
Since my baby left me

479
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,086
Well, I found a new place to dwell

480
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:56,673
- That's all right.
- Not really.

481
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,385
- It sounds raga. You don't wanna go raga.
- Not with this, it don't.

482
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:03,638
- Since my baby left me
- It sounds fuckin' barbershop.

483
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:06,224
- Barbershop raga.
- Watch the language.

484
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:09,435
- You're in the presence of the King.
- Oh. Sorry.

485
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,398
This is thoroughly depressing.

486
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,234
Really puts a perspective on things,
doesn't it?

487
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:20,280
Too much. There's too much fuckin'
perspective now.

488
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:25,618
In 1967, that was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

489
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,912
The whole world was changing
in those days.

490
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,667
We had the world's ear because we had
just released an enormous-selling single.

491
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,128
- Listen To The Flower People.
- Flower People.

492
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,505
We toured the world.
We toured the States.

493
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:40,633
- Toured the world and elsewhere.
- A dream come true.

494
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,638
Listen to what the flower people say

495
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:49,350
"JAMBOREEPOP"
(American TV - 1967)

496
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:56,190
Listen, it's getting louder every day

497
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:04,240
Listen, it's like a bolt out of the blue

498
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:13,457
Listen, it could be calling out for you

499
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,271
In the Flower People period,
who was your drummer?

500
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:37,356
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond.

501
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:40,526
He also died in mysterious
circumstances.

502
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:44,113
We were playing a jazz blues festival.
Where was that?

503
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,282
- Blues jazz, really.
- Blues jazz festival.

504
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,451
That was in the Isle...

505
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:51,954
The Isle of Lucy jazz and blues festival.

506
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,834
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded onstage.

507
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,836
- Just like that.
- He just went up.

508
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:01,839
He just was like a flash of green light...

509
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:07,261
- And that was it. Nothing was left.
- It's true. This really did happen.

510
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:10,097
There was a little green globule
on his drum seat.

511
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,517
- Like a stain, really.
- More of a stain than a globule.

512
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:17,980
You know, several... dozens of people
spontaneously combust each year.

513
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:21,483
It's just not really widely reported.

514
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:23,485
SHANK HALL
Milwaukee, Wisconsin

515
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:25,237
Testing!

516
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,739
Test, test, test.
This is mike number one.

517
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,283
This is mike number one.
Isn't this a lot of fun?

518
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,119
OK, he's got the mikes.

519
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:35,330
Let's do GSM, all right? GSM.

520
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,502
Stop wastin' my time

521
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,880
You know what I want

522
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,674
Heavy up!

523
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,927
You know what I n-n-n-need

524
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:52,013
Or maybe you don't

525
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:59,145
Or do I have to come right
smack-dab out and tell you everythin'

526
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:02,357
Gimme some money!

527
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:06,528
Gimme some money!

528
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,279
Oh, yeah

529
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:16,371
Hello, darling!

530
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,831
Hello! I've got a surprise for you!

531
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:22,877
- Where'd you come from?
- Where do you think I came from?

532
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:26,047
The bloody aeroplane, didn't I? Right?

533
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,258
David?

534
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:32,095
David? David?

535
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:34,138
David?

536
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,683
Oh, that feels good!

537
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,228
Oh, I've been wanting to do that
for a long time!

538
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,941
- Want me to carry it about with me?
- What's all this?

539
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:48,152
That's the film crew. I told you about this.

540
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,198
- Martin, this is Jeanine.
- Hello.

541
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:56,327
Here it is! Here it is, lads!

542
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,705
Smell The Glove, me old beauties!

543
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:01,874
Gather round. Where's David?

544
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,834
David! David, get up here!

545
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:08,089
David, Smell The Glove is here.
Hello, Jeanine.

546
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,925
The moment we've all been waiting for!

547
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:14,553
- I never thought I'd see the day.
- Plenty for everybody!

548
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,724
- What do you think?
- Is this the test pressing?

549
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,434
No, this is it.

550
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:25,356
- This is Smell The Glove by Spinal Tap?
- That's the jacket cover

551
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,443
- That's going out across the country.
- This is the compromise you made?

552
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,154
- Is it going to say anything here?
- Nope, it's not gonna say anything.

553
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:36,617
- So it's just gonna be all black?
- Simple, beautiful, classic.

554
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:41,664
It does look like black leather.
You can see yourself in both sides.

555
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:43,999
It's like a black mirror.

556
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:47,211
I think it looks like death.
It looks like mourning.

557
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:51,965
Every movie in every cinema
is about death. Death sells.

558
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:56,011
I think he's right. There's something
about this that is so black,

559
00:35:56,136 --> 00:36:01,892
it's, like, how much more black could
this be? And the answer is... none. None...

560
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:07,314
You're rationalising this whole thing
like it's something you did on purpose.

561
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:11,652
I think we're stuck with a very stupid
and dismal-looking album.

562
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:16,782
It's something you wear around your arm.
You don't put it on your fuckin' turntable!

563
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:21,995
This is the turning point, OK?
I think this is... We're on our way now.

564
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:24,289
It's time... It's time to kick arse.

565
00:36:57,197 --> 00:37:01,284
When there was darkness
and the void was king

566
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:04,829
And ruled the elements

567
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:07,832
When there was silence, and the hush

568
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:11,044
Was almost deafening

569
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,384
- Out of the emptiness
- Salvation

570
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,345
Salvation

571
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:24,390
Rhythm and light and sound

572
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,478
'Twas a rock'n'roll creation

573
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,980
'Twas a terrible big bang

574
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:35,526
It was the ultimate mutation

575
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,696
Yin was searching for his Yang

576
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,368
And he looked
and he saw that it was good

577
00:37:54,462 --> 00:38:00,885
I look to the stars
and the answer is clear

578
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:08,392
I look in the mirror and see what I fear

579
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,203
'Tis the rock'n'roll creation

580
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:30,790
'Tis the absolute rebirth

581
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:34,210
It is the rolling of the ocean

582
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:36,962
And the rocking of the earth

583
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:42,259
And I looked and I saw that it was good

584
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:10,287
Given the history of Spinal Tap
drummers in the past,

585
00:39:10,454 --> 00:39:13,957
do you have any fears, uh... for your life?

586
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:16,376
When I did join, they did tell me.

587
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:20,756
They took me aside and said,
"Mick, you know, it's like this."

588
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:25,427
And it did kind of freak me out a bit,

589
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:28,805
but it can't always happen to every...
Can it?

590
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:31,933
The law of averages says you will survive.

591
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,726
Yeah.

592
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:39,399
Whoa, quite exciting.

593
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:42,319
Quite exciting, this computer magic.

594
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:48,658
- How many planets have you destroyed?
- About four for a fifth time round, I think.

595
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:51,745
We're doing really fine.
A few galaxies gone, you know.

596
00:39:54,456 --> 00:39:58,001
- This is Cindy's first moustache.
- Is it?

597
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,838
- Can I take it off now?
- Why, are you too hot in it?

598
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:06,051
No, it's... I thought I might go back
and see what they were up to.

599
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:10,096
I don't think they need to see this
until you're finished with it, you know?

600
00:40:10,263 --> 00:40:12,891
You were reading. You can read here.

601
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:15,852
Yeah, but they got
the new game back there.

602
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,564
I thought I could maybe
have a look at the new game.

603
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:23,568
- It's like a submarine thing.
- You've got stuff over you again.

604
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:26,988
Before I met Jeanine,
my life was a shambles.

605
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:32,660
I was using whatever Eastern philosophy
happened to drift through my transom.

606
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,958
And she sort of sorted it out for me.
Gave me a path, you know, to follow.

607
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,712
Do you have as much influence
over his musical expression?

608
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:48,301
Oh, yeah. I mean, I listen to him
when he's experimenting-don't I?

609
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:52,764
He plays things to me sometimes
when he's worked out...

610
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,600
He's got a new bit
he wants to tell me about.

611
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:59,395
And I say that's good or that's bad
or that's shit or whatever.

612
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,900
She's very honest. She's brutally frank.

613
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:07,278
How does that go over
with the other band members?

614
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:11,824
She gives me the brutally frank version,
and I sort of tart it up for them.

615
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:15,036
It's so strange because Nigel

616
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:21,208
and Jeanine are so similar
in so many ways, but they just can't...

617
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,169
They don't dislike each other.

618
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:25,796
- There's great love between them.
- Oh, yes.

619
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:30,676
But there's some sort of communication
that's just blocked or something.

620
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,944
- It's pretty.
- Yeah, I like it.

621
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:52,281
Been foolin' about with it
for a few months now.

622
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:54,074
Very delicate.

623
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:58,787
It's a bit of a departure from
the kind of thing you normally play.

624
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,749
Yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really.

625
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:04,585
A musical trilogy that I'm doing

626
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:10,257
in D... minor, which I always find
is really the saddest of all keys, really.

627
00:42:10,424 --> 00:42:14,553
I don't know why but it makes people
weep instantly if you play it.

628
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:19,933
- It's a horn part.
- It's very pretty.

629
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:25,522
You know, just simple lines, intertwining.

630
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:29,067
Very much like...
I'm really influenced by Mozart and Bach.

631
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:32,487
And it's sort of in between those,
like a Mach piece.

632
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:34,448
What do you call this?

633
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:37,701
This piece is called Lick My Love Pump.

634
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,126
Do you have any metal objects
in your pockets?

635
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,962
- Yeah.
- Put them in the bucket.

636
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,090
Coins... keys...

637
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:57,470
Tuning fork.

638
00:42:57,637 --> 00:43:00,473
Musician.
I have to stay in tune, you know?

639
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:05,687
Oh. OK.

640
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:11,234
- Could you take this jacket off, please?
- Oh, it's the zipper. Sets off the machine.

641
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:13,403
Let's go, hurry up!

642
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:19,451
Step over here, please.

643
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,286
Raise your arms.

644
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:27,000
Departure at gate 12 has been
delayed for approximately 20 minutes.

645
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,976
- Do you have artificial plates or limbs?
- Not really, no.

646
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:48,604
Would you, um...

647
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,332
I don't need a woman

648
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:11,419
I won't take me no wife

649
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:17,800
I got the rock'n'roll and that'll be my life

650
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:26,434
No page in history, baby,
that I don't need

651
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,480
I just wanna make some eardrums bleed

652
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:35,109
- Heavy
- Heavy

653
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:37,403
- Duty
- Duty

654
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,614
Heavy duty rock'n'roll

655
00:44:46,245 --> 00:44:47,663
- Heavy
- Heavy

656
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,331
- Duty
- Duty

657
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:55,462
Brings out the duty in my soul

658
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:23,532
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

659
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:30,622
Hi. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.
How are you?

660
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,792
- How you doing? You are... Derek.
- Derek.

661
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,961
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

662
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:39,214
I'm your promo man here in Chicago.
I love you guys.

663
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:43,093
And, of course, Nigel.
I love you. Nigel Tufnel.

664
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,470
I love your stuff. I go back with you guys.

665
00:45:45,637 --> 00:45:47,597
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

666
00:45:47,764 --> 00:45:50,559
- And who are you, darlin'?
- This is my special new friend, Cindy.

667
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:52,644
- Hello, Cindy.
- And this is Belinda.

668
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:55,522
Hello, Belinda.
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

669
00:45:55,689 --> 00:46:00,569
And I... Oh, what's going on here? Hi!
Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records.

670
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:03,196
Nice to see you. And where is David?

671
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:07,033
David, hi! Artie Fufkin.
How are you? Nice to see you.

672
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,621
- We've got something happening...
- It's the food! It's the food!

673
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:15,583
Oh! Thank God! Civilisation!
Where do I put this?

674
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,781
What are you doin' to me here? I thought
we had a relationship. What happened?

675
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:49,409
Business is terrible. What can I tell you?

676
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:53,413
A record store with a promotion
and nobody shows up?

677
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,581
This isn't a personal thing.

678
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:58,251
Forget personal thing.
We had a relationship.

679
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:00,169
What about our relationship?

680
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:05,383
I feel like a schlub.
I don't know what's happening.

681
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,010
It's me, that's what is happening. It's me.

682
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:09,887
I did it. It's my fault.

683
00:47:10,054 --> 00:47:12,265
We were told massive radio support.

684
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:16,435
We did! We did massive.
We saturated. We over-saturated.

685
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:19,063
It's me. I did it. I fucked up.

686
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:23,609
I fucked up the timing, that's all.
I got no timing. I got no timing.

687
00:47:23,776 --> 00:47:26,362
- You know what I want you to do?
- What?

688
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:29,657
Do me a favour. Just kick my ass, OK?

689
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:31,367
Kick this ass.

690
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:33,995
Kick my ass. Enjoy. Come on!

691
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:36,872
I'm not asking, I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.

692
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:43,504
XANADU STAR THEATER
Cleveland, Ohio

693
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:52,638
We've kept 'em waitin' long enough.
Let's do it.

694
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:55,182
Come on, Mick!

695
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:58,602
- Let's go, Mr Shrimpton!
- Rock'n'roll!

696
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:00,729
Rock'n'roll!

697
00:48:03,107 --> 00:48:04,900
Let's have some rock'n'roll!

698
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:07,736
Rock'n'roll! Let's go, then.

699
00:48:11,824 --> 00:48:14,243
- It's gonna be a hot one.
- It's gonna be great.

700
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,121
- Not an exit.
- We don't want an exit.

701
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,748
- No, that's true.
- This way.

702
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:22,334
Yeah, this way. Let's go.

703
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:27,297
Um...

704
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:31,051
- Wait. This looks familiar, though.
- Listen!

705
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,974
Shit!

706
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,978
Let's not lose it, let's not lose it.

707
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,271
Where the fuck is Ian?
He should be here.

708
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:45,524
Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!

709
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:50,529
We've gotta get to it some way.
We've been onstage, right?

710
00:48:51,905 --> 00:48:55,367
We're in the group.
We're in the group that's playin' tonight.

711
00:48:55,534 --> 00:49:00,539
You go straight through this door here,
down the hall, turn right,

712
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:04,501
and then there's a little jog,
about 30 feet. Jog to the left.

713
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:08,129
- We don't have time for that.
- Go straight ahead,

714
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:10,465
turn right at the next two corners.

715
00:49:10,632 --> 00:49:14,010
On the first door is a sign:
"authorised personnel only".

716
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:16,763
- Open that door. That's the stage.
- You think so?

717
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,599
You're authorised.
You're musicians, aren't ya?

718
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:21,685
Thank you. Thank you very much.

719
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:23,645
Rock'n'roll!

720
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:24,813
Rock'n'roll!

721
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:27,399
Let's get it! Let's get it!

722
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,734
- This way?
- No, this way.

723
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:31,945
Straight through. Rock'n'roll!

724
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:35,156
Hello, Cleveland! Hello, Cleveland!

725
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,745
- Fuck!
- You must've made a wrong turn.

726
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:46,417
- We gotta go another way.
- Other way, other way. Other way!

727
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:51,589
I hate to keep harping on, but the notion
of a black album has cursed us.

728
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:55,718
We're getting substantial reports
of airplay. Don't worry about that.

729
00:49:55,885 --> 00:50:00,598
But... it might have been better if the, uh...
album had been mixed right.

730
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:04,102
Well, no use crying over that,
but of course that's true.

731
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,729
Well, it was mixed all wrong, wasn't it?

732
00:50:06,896 --> 00:50:09,190
It was mixed wrong? Were you there?

733
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:14,153
- But she's heard the record.
- So your judgment is it was mixed wrong.

734
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,865
- You couldn't hear the lyrics.
- You don't agree?

735
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:20,701
- No, I do not agree.
- Well, I think maybe...

736
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:24,539
- It's interesting she's bringing it up.
- She'd like to hear the vocals.

737
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:28,626
It's like me saying you're using
the wrong conditioner for your hair.

738
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:31,295
It looks sort of frizzy.

739
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:35,633
- You don't do 'eavy metal in Dubly.
- In what? In what?

740
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,431
- In Dubly. You can't...
- She means Dolby, all right?

741
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:44,141
You know what she means.

742
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,353
You shan't recover from this one.

743
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,691
Can I have the floor for just one moment?
I've got something I'd like to show you.

744
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:56,403
Jeanine's been working
on these very hard.

745
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,990
- These are a new direction...
- A new presentation.

746
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,535
The stage look of the band,
based on the signs of the zodiac.

747
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:05,246
We need a new presentation.

748
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:11,418
This is a look for Viv. He's a Libra.
There's the sort of Yin/Yang sort of look.

749
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:14,546
This is Nigel. He's Capricorn.

750
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,091
- Sort of a goat look.
- With a beard.

751
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:19,426
- Is this a joke?
- This...

752
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:23,180
- Excuse me. Is this a joke?
- Just bear with us for one moment.

753
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:26,141
This... I love this.
I wish I were Cancer.

754
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:28,977
- That's attractive.
- This is your crab face.

755
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:30,938
Give it a chance.

756
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:34,650
- And this is...
- David, wait, please. Wait a minute.

757
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:40,322
Have you any idea what it will cost
to dress up the band as animals?

758
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:43,492
- Oh, it don't cost nothin'.
- They're not animals...

759
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:46,995
It's a way to fight the drabs.
We've got the drabs.

760
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:51,458
That's true. I think mine would look better
in Dubly. If it was done in Dubly...

761
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,293
Shut up!

762
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,130
- If you're not open-minded enough...
- David...

763
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:59,716
There are solutions to our problems.

764
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:03,220
- I think we know what they are.
- I've yet to hear them.

765
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,473
We can take a rational approach.
We can say...

766
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,560
- May I make a suggestion?
- Oh, let's hear your suggestion.

767
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,230
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

768
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,482
Best production value we've ever had.

769
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:19,486
But we haven't got the equipment.
We haven't got Stonehenge.

770
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,529
Please, please. Just a moment.

771
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:25,075
- Musically, we all know it.
- It's not a bad idea.

772
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:29,829
No problems musically.
We go right onstage and it's quite simple.

773
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:32,082
Ian can take care of this.

774
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,086
But we don't have
that piece of scenery any more.

775
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:38,797
I know! So we build a new one.

776
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:43,676
- And this is it.
- Consider it done.

777
00:52:43,843 --> 00:52:47,764
You're just gonna take care of it like that?
Using that as the plans?

778
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,141
- Let's try.
- If you can do it, I'll do the number.

779
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,478
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

780
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:58,066
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

781
00:52:58,232 --> 00:53:01,736
- The way you would like to?
- Well, I think I do, in my solos.

782
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:03,488
My solos are my trademark.

783
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:53,120
Perfect. It's the right proportions.

784
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:55,206
- It'll be this colour, right?
- Yeah.

785
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:58,751
That's just terrific.
It almost looks like the real thing.

786
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:00,336
- You got it.
- Yeah.

787
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,338
When we get the actual set,

788
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:06,425
it'll follow exactly these specifications?
Even these contours?

789
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:10,221
Um... I don't understand you.
The actual piece?

790
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:15,017
- When you build the actual piece...
- But this is what you asked for, isn't it?

791
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:17,770
- What?
- Well, this is the piece.

792
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:20,022
- This is the piece?
- Yes.

793
00:54:20,189 --> 00:54:25,069
Are you telling me that this is it?
This is scenery?

794
00:54:25,235 --> 00:54:27,237
Have you ever been to Stonehenge?

795
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:31,450
The triptychs are 20 feet high!
You can stand four men up 'em!

796
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:35,204
Ian, I was asked to build it 18 inches high!

797
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:38,248
Look. This is what I was asked to build.

798
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:42,085
18 inches. Right here.
It's specified, 18 inches.

799
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:45,714
- I was given this napkin.
- Forget this! Fuck the napkin!

800
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:53,055
In ancient times,

801
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:58,894
hundreds of years
before the dawn of history,

802
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:03,440
lived an ancient race of people.

803
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:07,277
The Druids.

804
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:19,998
No one knows who they were

805
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,919
or

806
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,504
what they were doing.

807
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:30,425
But their legacy remains.

808
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:33,511
Hewn

809
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:36,931
into the living rock

810
00:55:37,098 --> 00:55:39,309
of Stonehenge.

811
00:55:51,237 --> 00:55:54,324
Stonehenge-where the demons dwell

812
00:55:54,491 --> 00:55:58,244
Where the banshees live
and they do live well

813
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:01,748
Stonehenge-where a man is a man

814
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:05,376
And the children dance
to the pipes of Pan

815
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:12,467
And you, my love

816
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,844
Won't you take my hand

817
00:56:16,763 --> 00:56:18,765
We'll go back in time

818
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:22,351
To that mystic land

819
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:27,023
Where the dewdrops cry

820
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,317
And the cats meow

821
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,321
I will take you there

822
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,200
I will show you how

823
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:57,011
And, oh, how they danced,

824
00:56:57,178 --> 00:57:00,681
the little children of Stonehenge,

825
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:04,977
beneath the haunted moon,

826
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:08,439
for fear that daybreak

827
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:11,650
might come too soon.

828
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:37,885
The problem wasn't that the band was
down. The problem may have been

829
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:43,807
that there was a Stonehenge monument
in danger of being crushed... by a dwarf.

830
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:48,312
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

831
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:52,983
- You're making too big a thing out of it.
- Making a big thing was the idea.

832
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,819
Nigel gave me a drawing
that said 18 inches.

833
00:57:55,986 --> 00:57:56,945
I know...

834
00:57:57,112 --> 00:58:01,241
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

835
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:05,954
But you're not as confused as him. It's not
your job to be as confused as Nigel is.

836
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:10,542
It's my job to do what I'm asked to do
by the creative element of this band.

837
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:13,670
- The audience were laughing.
- So it became a comedy number.

838
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:18,133
Yes, it fuckin' did, and it was not pleasant
to be part of the comedy onstage.

839
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,719
Backstage, perhaps it was very amusing.

840
00:58:20,886 --> 00:58:24,806
Maybe we just fix the choreography,
keep the dwarf clear.

841
00:58:24,973 --> 00:58:27,392
- What do you mean?
- So he won't trod upon it.

842
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:31,187
That's not the issue.
I think it's symptomatic of taking on more

843
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:35,066
than you can, er... er... handle.

844
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:38,111
It's not the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

845
00:58:38,278 --> 00:58:43,158
There have been some gaping holes
in the business end...

846
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:47,787
Excuse me. This is a band meeting, right?
Are you here for some reason?

847
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:51,416
- She's with me.
- Is she now in the band?

848
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,751
I care what happens to the band.

849
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:58,381
David, whenever a single ruffle comes
into this adolescent fantasy world

850
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:00,884
you guys have built around yourself,

851
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:04,137
you start screaming like a bunch
of poncey hairdressers!

852
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:07,682
It's just a problem! It gets solved!

853
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:13,104
It doesn't! If it got solved, that would be
all right, but it doesn't get solved.

854
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,982
I mean, what got solved tonight?

855
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:20,528
For one single thing that goes wrong,
a hundred things go right.

856
00:59:20,695 --> 00:59:22,822
Do you know what
I spend my time doing?

857
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:26,909
I sleep two or three hours a night.
There's no sex and drugs for Ian, David.

858
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:29,078
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

859
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:31,914
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin.

860
00:59:32,081 --> 00:59:34,333
I prise the rent out of the local Hebrews.

861
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,378
Get someone else to find luggage,

862
00:59:37,545 --> 00:59:40,131
and you concentrate on the stage.

863
00:59:40,298 --> 00:59:44,677
- You'd like me to be road manager?
- No! All bad blood aside...

864
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:48,472
What Dave is trying to say,
if you'd let him get a word through,

865
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:53,728
- Is you could maybe do with some help.
- Some help?

866
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:56,480
- Managing the band.
- It's very simple.

867
00:59:56,647 --> 01:00:00,401
Maybe there's someone already here...
We don't have to pay insurance.

868
01:00:00,568 --> 01:00:04,697
We don't have to pay extra room...
since she's already here, among us,

869
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:08,951
- And she's capable of taking over.
- "She"? Wait a minute.

870
01:00:09,118 --> 01:00:11,328
Who do you think I'm talking about?

871
01:00:11,495 --> 01:00:14,665
I would never have dreamed
it was her you were talking about.

872
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,501
I am offering to help out here.

873
01:00:17,668 --> 01:00:20,254
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me.

874
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:22,923
Yes, that is exactly it.

875
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:27,303
I'm not gonna co-manage with some girl
just cos she's your girlfriend!

876
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:32,057
Oh! "Girlfriend", is it? I don't know
what you're doing managing the band!

877
01:00:32,224 --> 01:00:34,768
- Why don't we just...
- Shut up!

878
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:39,022
This is my position. I am not managing it
with you or any other woman.

879
01:00:39,189 --> 01:00:43,068
Especially one who dresses like an
Australian's nightmare. So fuck you!

880
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:47,656
Fuck all of you! Because I quit, all right?
That's it. Good night.

881
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:01,128
Can I raise a practical question
at this point?

882
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:03,422
Are we gonna do Stonehenge tomorrow?

883
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:06,758
No, we're not gonna
fuckin' do Stonehenge!

884
01:01:06,925 --> 01:01:09,428
OK, we're all set. Thank you.

885
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:15,684
All right, fellas. I got the tickets. We're on
the 3.10 flight at gate 24, all right?

886
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:20,605
It arrives at 4 o'clock in Colorado. Then
we got a limo to take us to the Lodge.

887
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:23,567
It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

888
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:28,405
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

889
01:01:28,572 --> 01:01:33,326
- This is so great.
- We know that the band's sign is Virgo.

890
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:38,331
You see, Saturn's in the third house,
and it's a bit rocky.

891
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:44,379
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

892
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:47,465
we're gonna pull through this
with great aplomb.

893
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:49,134
Has someone not got one?

894
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,389
Nigel hasn't got one.
Nigel! Nigel! We got pages for you here.

895
01:01:55,265 --> 01:01:57,267
He's got one. He's got it.

896
01:01:57,434 --> 01:02:00,728
Think what a jumble
a tour book usually is...

897
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:02,897
- He's got one.
- Right.

898
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:06,568
What I want to explain to you
is that Denver...

899
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:11,364
How would you characterise your
relationship with David over the years?

900
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:14,075
- Has it changed in any way?
- Not really.

901
01:02:14,242 --> 01:02:19,664
I mean, you know, we've grown up...
but really it's not...

902
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:24,127
No, not really.
We feel like children much of the time,

903
01:02:24,293 --> 01:02:26,546
even when we're playing.

904
01:02:26,713 --> 01:02:29,132
We're closer than brothers.

905
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,801
Brothers always fight.

906
01:02:31,968 --> 01:02:35,096
Sort of... disagreements and all that.

907
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,267
We really have a relationship that's way,
way past that.

908
01:02:45,523 --> 01:02:48,776
- He can't play any more.
- You know the parts.

909
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,946
If he knew the fuckin' part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

910
01:02:52,113 --> 01:02:56,867
- Are you walking out? Great!
- Just tell me what we're supposed to do.

911
01:02:57,034 --> 01:02:59,537
We're supposed to play the fuckin' thing!

912
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:02,498
- We've spent an hour and a half...
- I'm doing my part!

913
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:06,377
You know what would make this a lot
simpler? I hate to cut right to it here.

914
01:03:06,544 --> 01:03:11,215
Why don't you play this alone, without
some angel hanging over your head?

915
01:03:11,382 --> 01:03:14,301
Jesus Christ!
This is fuckin' all we need.

916
01:03:14,468 --> 01:03:18,055
You can't fuckin' concentrate
because of your fuckin' wife!

917
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:20,516
- It's your fuckin' wife!
- She's not my wife.

918
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:24,687
Whatever the fuck she is,
we can't fuckin' do the track!

919
01:03:24,853 --> 01:03:28,524
- This is unbelievable!
- No, it's not unbelievable at all!

920
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:32,820
Am I losing my fuckin' mind?!
Could you check me on this?

921
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:35,656
I don't understand
what this has to do with anything!

922
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:40,786
We're very lucky, in a sense,
that we've got two visionaries in the band.

923
01:03:40,953 --> 01:03:43,622
David and Nigel are both like...

924
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,501
Like poets,
like Shelley or Byron or people like that.

925
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:50,963
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

926
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,590
It's like fire and ice, basically.

927
01:03:53,757 --> 01:03:57,302
I feel my role in the band is to be
kind of in the middle of that,

928
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:59,555
kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

929
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,604
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

930
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:12,192
There's no time to go to the hotel.
You'd better go straight to the base.

931
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:14,194
- Base?
- The gig.

932
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:17,739
- To the Civic Arena, right?
- No.

933
01:04:17,906 --> 01:04:23,787
Wait a second. Hold it. Do you know
about this and we don't know about this?

934
01:04:23,954 --> 01:04:27,624
- We're going to the air-force base.
- Why go to an air-force base?

935
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:30,001
Because the original gig fell through!

936
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:37,175
- Lieutenant Hookstrat?
- Hookstratten.

937
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:41,721
- You are Spinal Tarp?
- I'm Jeanine and this is Spinal Tap.

938
01:04:41,888 --> 01:04:46,309
Spinal Tap. I'm Bob Hookstratten.
Welcome to Lindbergh Air Force Base.

939
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:49,437
Is this your first visit
to a military facility?

940
01:04:49,604 --> 01:04:52,691
May I start by saying
how thrilled we are to have you here.

941
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:56,069
We are such fans of your music
and all of your records.

942
01:04:56,236 --> 01:04:59,614
Not yours personally,
but the whole genre of rock'n'roll

943
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:02,075
and the exciting things in music today.

944
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:06,579
Let me explain what's going on.
This is our monthly at ease weekend.

945
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:11,543
It gives us a chance to let down our hair,
although I see you have a head start!

946
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:14,254
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster!

947
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:16,881
My hair's getting a little shaggy, too.

948
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:21,761
Better not get too close. They'll think
I'm in the band! I'm joking, of course.

949
01:05:22,804 --> 01:05:25,473
Walk this way, please.
Right through here.

950
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:30,228
Did you ever run into a group, works out
of Kansas City - Four Jacks And A Jill?

951
01:05:30,395 --> 01:05:36,984
If you're ever there and wanna hear some
good music, you might wanna drop by.

952
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:42,782
I would like to get the playing on
about 1900 hours, if that's satisfactory.

953
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:46,786
- When would that be?
- I make it now... it's about 1830 hours.

954
01:05:46,953 --> 01:05:49,872
- So that's what? 50 hours?
- 120 hours?

955
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:53,417
That's actually about 30 minutes...
give or take a few minutes.

956
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:57,588
I don't wanna rush you. The idea is
we can get it on and we get it over with.

957
01:05:57,755 --> 01:06:01,008
And would you play a couple
of slow numbers so I can dance?

958
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,469
Working on a sex farm

959
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:08,849
Ploughing through your bean field

960
01:06:10,017 --> 01:06:12,686
Gettin' out my pitchfork

961
01:06:14,146 --> 01:06:16,315
Pokin' your hay

962
01:06:18,192 --> 01:06:22,613
Sex farm woman,
I'm gonna mow you down

963
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,867
Sex farm woman,
I'll rake and hoe you down

964
01:06:27,034 --> 01:06:31,539
Sex farm woman,
don't you see my silo risin' high?

965
01:06:31,705 --> 01:06:33,707
High, high, high

966
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,919
Hi-i-i-i-gh...

967
01:06:56,563 --> 01:06:58,857
Working on a sex farm

968
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:04,404
Tryin' to raise some hard love

969
01:07:05,572 --> 01:07:08,242
Gettin' out my pitchfork

970
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:20,420
He totally ruined the gig there.
He walks off and then...

971
01:07:20,587 --> 01:07:25,050
He can't sit at home and get money.
We gotta get someone else in there.

972
01:07:25,217 --> 01:07:28,345
Has he done this before?
Has he quit the band before?

973
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:32,432
No, but you gotta understand that,
in the world of rock'n'roll,

974
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:36,186
there are certain changes
that sometimes occur.

975
01:07:36,353 --> 01:07:39,189
And you've just got to
sort of roll with them.

976
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:43,985
You saw exactly how many people
have been in this band over the years.

977
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:46,446
37 people have been in this band
over the years.

978
01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:50,784
I mean, six months from now,
I can't see myself missing Nige

979
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:54,496
any more than I might miss
Ross McLachness

980
01:07:54,663 --> 01:07:58,541
or Ronnie Pudding or Danny Uppam
or Danny Schindler or any of those.

981
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:05,048
I can't believe that. I can't believe that
you're lumping Nigel in with

982
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:08,635
the people you played with
for a short time.

983
01:08:08,802 --> 01:08:13,515
Well, I'd feel much worse if I weren't
under such heavy sedation, but

984
01:08:13,681 --> 01:08:16,809
you've gotta be realistic
about this sort of thing.

985
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:19,145
So what happens to the band now?

986
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:22,482
- What do you mean?
- He's not coming back or...

987
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:25,485
No. We shan't work together again.

988
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:32,950
THEMELAND AMUSEMENT PARK
Stockton, California

989
01:08:34,327 --> 01:08:35,745
- Oh, no.
- Great.

990
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:39,207
If I told them once,
I told them a hundred times

991
01:08:39,374 --> 01:08:42,835
to put Spinal Tap first
and Puppet Show last.

992
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,171
It's a morale builder, isn't it?

993
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:48,549
You got a big dressing room...
You got a big dressing room.

994
01:08:48,716 --> 01:08:51,886
A bigger dressing room than the puppets?
That's refreshing.

995
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,723
I've got some of this Mendocino rocket
fuel that's supposed to be really nice.

996
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:59,769
Can you play... Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line

997
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,313
like Nigel used to on Big Bottom?

998
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,316
Can you double that?
You remember it? It's in fifths.

999
01:09:05,483 --> 01:09:07,526
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got two hands here.

1000
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:11,864
- So we can play that one.
- Hole is out, Heavy is out.

1001
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:14,033
Right, right, right, right.

1002
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,370
America we can't do. It's Nigel's tune.
It's not my tune.

1003
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:21,082
- That's a nice, cosy ten-minute set.
- What are we gonna do?

1004
01:09:21,248 --> 01:09:24,543
- We got nothing to play.
- I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

1005
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:27,505
- What?
- Jazz Odyssey.

1006
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:33,969
We're not about to do a free-form jazz
exploration in front of a festival crowd.

1007
01:09:35,012 --> 01:09:40,476
You are witnesses at the new birth
of Spinal Tap, Mark 2.

1008
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:46,065
Hope you enjoy our new direction.

1009
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:09,963
On the bass - Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.

1010
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:19,389
END OF TOUR PARTY
Los Angeles

1011
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:22,225
So tonight's the last show of the tour.

1012
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,562
Is this your last waltz?
Are we talking the end of Spinal Tap

1013
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:28,815
or are you gonna try to milk it
for a few more years in Europe?

1014
01:10:28,982 --> 01:10:34,613
Well, I don't really think that the end...
can be assessed... er...

1015
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,199
as of itself as being the end.

1016
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:40,535
What does the end feel like?
It's like saying when you try

1017
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:43,205
to extrapolate the end of the universe.

1018
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:47,250
If the universe is indeed infinite,
then what does that mean?

1019
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:51,421
How far is all the way?
And then if it stops, what's stopping it?

1020
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:56,843
And what's behind what's stopping it?
"What's the end?" is my question to you.

1021
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,763
- It's a good crowd, good crowd.
- It is, isn't it?

1022
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:02,432
Yeah. Some of these things,
you know, don't mean much.

1023
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:07,270
It's hard to get at the last minute.
You can't arrange it all overnight.

1024
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:09,606
David, we had a 15-year ride, mate.

1025
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:13,276
Who wants to be
a 45-year-old rock'n'roller farting around

1026
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:15,987
in front of people less than half their age,

1027
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:20,575
cranking out some mediocre
head-banging bullshit we've forgotten?

1028
01:11:20,742 --> 01:11:24,496
- It's beneath us. Who wants to see that?
- Absolutely right.

1029
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:28,625
We can take all those projects
we didn't have time for.

1030
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:33,129
We didn't have time because of Tap.
Bring 'em back to life, maybe.

1031
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:35,923
- Do you remember what...
- At the Luton Palace,

1032
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:40,428
we were talking about a rock musical
based on the life of Jack the Ripper.

1033
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:43,181
- Yeah. Saucy Jack.
- Now is the time to do that.

1034
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:45,600
- You're a naughty one
- Saucy Jack

1035
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:48,019
You're a haughty one, Saucy Jack

1036
01:11:48,186 --> 01:11:51,063
It's a freeing up, innit?
It's all this free time.

1037
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:54,275
- Suddenly time is so elastic.
- It's a gift. A gift of freedom.

1038
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:58,196
I've always wanted to do
a collection of my acoustic numbers

1039
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:01,240
with the London Philharmonic,
as you know.

1040
01:12:01,407 --> 01:12:04,952
We're lucky.
People should be envying us, you know.

1041
01:12:05,077 --> 01:12:07,955
- I envy us.
- Yeah. Me too.

1042
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:18,090
It's gonna be fine, right?

1043
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,344
- We'll make 'em miss us.
- Nice thought.

1044
01:12:24,513 --> 01:12:27,266
I'm in. I'm in tune.

1045
01:12:27,433 --> 01:12:31,187
- The last tuning.
- I think we should go in.

1046
01:12:31,353 --> 01:12:33,856
I think it's time to go, right?

1047
01:12:34,023 --> 01:12:36,859
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

1048
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:41,697
We're gonna do Reach Out When You Die
In My Champagne.

1049
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:58,714
Come to see the show?

1050
01:12:59,131 --> 01:13:02,801
- Yeah. Hello, mate.
- Nige.

1051
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:10,100
So did you just come here
to hang around backstage?

1052
01:13:10,225 --> 01:13:13,729
- Is that what you're doin'?
- I'm really a messenger.

1053
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:17,024
- Oh, a messenger.
- Yeah. I bumped into Ian and, er...

1054
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:18,734
Ian?

1055
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,903
Oh, the other dead man, yeah.

1056
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:26,408
Seems that Sex Farm
is on the charts in Japan.

1057
01:13:26,575 --> 01:13:28,869
Spinal Tap's recording of Sex Farm?

1058
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:32,122
It was at number five last week, actually.

1059
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:35,375
So he asked me

1060
01:13:36,752 --> 01:13:40,130
to ask you, Tap,

1061
01:13:40,297 --> 01:13:43,133
if you'd be interested in re-forming

1062
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,887
and, er... doing a tour. Japan.

1063
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:50,724
So you've come back to re-plug
our life-support systems in?

1064
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:54,853
By the grace of your...
By the stroke of your hand...

1065
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,231
You're gonna bring us back to life?
Is that why you've come?

1066
01:13:58,398 --> 01:14:01,860
- No, I've come...
- I mean... The fuckin'...

1067
01:14:02,027 --> 01:14:05,113
nerve that you've displayed...

1068
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,658
I'm just passing on the information, really.

1069
01:14:08,825 --> 01:14:13,747
Well, it's time to go in. We haven't got
time to discuss this now. Come on.

1070
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,026
David,

1071
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:45,570
do a good show, all right?

1072
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:48,865
Yeah, OK.

1073
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,851
Little girl, it's a great big world

1074
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:19,020
But there's only one of me

1075
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:22,356
You can't touch cos I cost too much

1076
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,234
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1077
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:27,903
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1078
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,321
Tonight!

1079
01:15:39,123 --> 01:15:40,916
You're sweet but you're just four feet

1080
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,377
And you still got your baby teeth

1081
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,755
You're too young and I'm too well hung

1082
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:49,466
- But tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1083
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:52,136
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you
- Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1084
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:54,305
Tonight!

1085
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:57,516
Oh, yeah

1086
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:21,165
Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar!

1087
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,648
You're hot, you take all we've got

1088
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:49,943
JOE "MAMA" BESSER
Drums

1089
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,320
Next day, we'll be on our way

1090
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:53,488
But tonight I'm gonna rock you

1091
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,074
KOBE HALL
Tokyo, Japan

1092
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,284
Tonight I'm gonna rock you

1093
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,452
Tonight!

1094
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:11,589
Little girl, it's a great big world
but there's only one of

1095
01:17:13,758 --> 01:17:16,261
Me!

1096
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:36,155
Do you feel that playing rock'n'roll music

1097
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:40,827
keeps you a child? Keeps you
in a state of arrested development?

1098
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:43,580
No, no. I feel it's like...

1099
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:47,000
It's more like going
to a national park or something,

1100
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,419
and they've preserved the moose.

1101
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:53,464
And that's... my childhood
up there onstage is that moose.

1102
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,093
So when you're playing, you feel
like a preserved moose onstage?

1103
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:02,056
I've been listening to the classics.
I belong to a great series.

1104
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:04,976
It's called
The Namesake Series of cassettes.

1105
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:09,981
They send you works of famous authors
done by actors with the same last name.

1106
01:18:10,148 --> 01:18:13,526
So I've got Denholm Elliott
reading TS Eliot on this one.

1107
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:15,194
- Interesting.
- Yes.

1108
01:18:15,361 --> 01:18:19,240
I've got Danny Thomas doing A Child's
Christmas In Wales by Dylan Thomas.

1109
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:24,787
Next month it's McLean Stevenson
reads Robert Louis Stevenson.

1110
01:18:24,954 --> 01:18:28,124
- Treasure Island, I believe.
- Interesting. Fascinating.

1111
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:31,669
There's also the shorter works
of Washington Irving

1112
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:34,130
read by someone called Dr J.

1113
01:18:34,296 --> 01:18:39,969
- That's Julius Irving.
- There you go, in keeping with the series.

1114
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:42,346
- You like this?
- Looks like Halloween.

1115
01:18:42,513 --> 01:18:47,143
This is my exact inner structure
done in a T-shirt.

1116
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:50,187
Exactly medically accurate, see?

1117
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:53,732
So, if we were to take
all your flesh and blood...

1118
01:18:53,857 --> 01:18:57,903
- This is what you'd see.
- It wouldn't be green, though.

1119
01:18:58,028 --> 01:19:01,782
It is green.
See how your blood looks blue?

1120
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:06,036
That's just the vein, the colour of the vein.
The blood is actually red.

1121
01:19:06,203 --> 01:19:09,957
Oh, maybe it's not green, then.
Anyway, this is what I sleep in.

1122
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:15,504
Denis Eton-Hogg, President of Polymer
Records, was recently knighted.

1123
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:19,091
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

1124
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:23,720
The specific reason why he was knighted
was for the founding of Hoggwood,

1125
01:19:23,887 --> 01:19:27,641
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

1126
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:33,647
David St Hubbins. I must admit
I've never heard anybody with that name.

1127
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:37,985
It's an unusual name. He was an unusual
saint. He's not a very well-known saint.

1128
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:41,154
- Oh, there was a St Hubbins?
- Yes. That's right, yes.

1129
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,117
- What was he the saint of?
- The patron saint of quality footwear.

1130
01:19:45,283 --> 01:19:50,539
You play to predominantly...
predominantly a white audience.

1131
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:52,916
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

1132
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:55,377
- No, of course not.
- No, not at all.

1133
01:19:55,544 --> 01:19:59,256
We say, "Love your brother."
We don't say it really, but...

1134
01:19:59,422 --> 01:20:02,634
We don't literally say it.
We don't literally mean it.

1135
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:06,471
- We're not racists.
- But... that message should be clear.

1136
01:20:06,638 --> 01:20:08,098
We're anything but racists.

1137
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:11,977
We've grown musically. You listen
to some of the rubbish we did early on.

1138
01:20:12,143 --> 01:20:14,271
It was stupid, and now we're...

1139
01:20:14,437 --> 01:20:18,942
I mean, a song like Sex Farm,
we're taking a sophisticated view

1140
01:20:19,109 --> 01:20:24,155
- Of the idea of sex and music.
- And putting it on a farm.

1141
01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:30,703
If I were to ask you your philosophy of life
or your creed, what would that be?

1142
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:33,790
Have a good time

1143
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:37,085
all the time.

1144
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:39,379
That's my philosophy, Marty.

1145
01:20:39,546 --> 01:20:42,590
I believe virtually everything I read,
and I think that

1146
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:48,263
is what makes me more selective than
someone who doesn't believe anything.

1147
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:51,891
Do you have a philosophy
or a creed that you live by?

1148
01:20:52,058 --> 01:20:54,060
Well, personally,

1149
01:20:54,227 --> 01:20:57,939
I like to think about sex and drugs
and rock'n'roll. That's my life.

1150
01:20:58,106 --> 01:21:01,651
If you were to have something written
as your epitaph...

1151
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:06,072
Here lies David St Hubbins,

1152
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:10,701
and why not?

1153
01:21:11,577 --> 01:21:15,915
- You feel that sums up your life?
- No. It's the first thing I could think of.

1154
01:21:16,082 --> 01:21:18,084
It doesn't sum up anything, really.

1155
01:21:18,209 --> 01:21:21,337
I'm a real fish nut. I really like fish.

1156
01:21:21,504 --> 01:21:25,925
- What kind of fish?
- Well, in the United States, you have cod.

1157
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,678
I like cod. And I love tuna.

1158
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:32,556
Those little cans you've got here.
Tuna fish... I love that.

1159
01:21:32,723 --> 01:21:35,059
- No bones.
- Yeah.

1160
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:39,355
If you could not play rock'n'roll,
what would you do?

1161
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:41,440
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

1162
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:45,569
I'd probably get a bit stupid and start
to make a fool of myself in public,

1163
01:21:45,736 --> 01:21:47,655
cos there wouldn't be a stage.

1164
01:21:47,822 --> 01:21:49,824
Probably work with children.

1165
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:55,496
As long as there's, you know, sex and
drugs, I can do without the rock'n'roll.

1166
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:03,796
Well, I suppose I could work in a shop
of some kind, or do freelance selling

1167
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:06,632
of some sort of product.

1168
01:22:06,757 --> 01:22:10,511
- A salesman?
- Like, maybe in a haberdasher,

1169
01:22:10,678 --> 01:22:15,224
or maybe like a... um...
a chapeau shop or something.

1170
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:20,896
You know, "What size do you wear, sir?"
and then you answer me.

1171
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:24,691
- Seven and a quarter.
- "I think we have that."

1172
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:26,860
Something like that I could do.

1173
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:30,697
- You think you'd be happy...
- "No, we're all out. Do you wear black?"

1174
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,700
See, that sort of thing
I think I could muster up.

1175
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:36,828
Do you think you'd be happy doing that?

1176
01:22:36,954 --> 01:22:39,331
I don't know. What are the hours?

1177
01:22:39,498 --> 01:22:40,457
