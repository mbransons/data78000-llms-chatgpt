1
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,568
Security has been tightened
throughout the country.

2
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:35,349
All borders have been placed on full alert.

3
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,801
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

4
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:43,978
In addition, we have assurance
from our undercover agents in the West

5
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,814
that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

6
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,787
All military leaves have been cancelled,

7
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:54,143
and we have doubled the guard
around Dr Flammond.

8
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:57,978
Finally, all systems are in readiness

9
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,855
for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

10
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:05,745
- As you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

11
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:09,005
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here

12
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,361
on their manoeuvres,
and completely vulnerable.

13
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,923
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

14
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,525
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, Herr General.

15
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:26,361
You should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request,

16
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:30,771
the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

17
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:35,854
Well done, Herr Major.
Then everything has gone to plan?

18
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,689
Well, not exactly, mein General.

19
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:44,100
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

20
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,785
They are sending
another performer in his place.

21
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:51,674
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

22
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:55,510
His name is...Nick Rivers.

23
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,099
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

24
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:01,456
As long as the world's attention
is fixed on our cultural festival,

25
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:03,373
no one will know what is about to happen.

26
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,043
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

27
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:14,879
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

28
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,968
A pen.

29
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,571
A table.

30
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:12,845
A table.

31
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,132
The pen is on the table.

32
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:29,146
There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.

33
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,748
Come in.

34
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:43,528
What did he say?

35
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,118
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

36
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,611
Better have our passports ready.

37
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,966
This is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

38
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:56,761
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

39
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,446
And above all, we play by their rules.

40
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:02,034
Martin, I've been practising.
How's this?

41
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:09,226
- What does that mean?
- Is your daughter 18?

42
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,034
Your papers, please.

43
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,801
Mr Nick Rivers.

44
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:27,157
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

45
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,266
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

46
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,376
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble.

47
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:57,265
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

48
00:07:57,265 --> 00:08:01,677
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

49
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:08,196
Good day.

50
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,443
What the hell did you say to him?

51
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:21,046
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

52
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:26,031
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

53
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:27,949
Normally he wouldn't say...

54
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,840
Your attitude is being noted, Mr Rivers.

55
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,976
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for trouble.

56
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:32,960
I want a schnauzer
with my Wiener schnitzel.

57
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:24,259
from all over the world as our guests,

58
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,753
we wish to express our appreciation

59
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:29,342
by offering to you these keys to our city,

60
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:34,807
which will be presented by our
East German Women's Olympic Team.

61
00:10:54,464 --> 00:11:00,696
Tonight, we begin our Festival
at the Concert Hall,

62
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:04,532
where the distinguished Madam Bergerone
and her ballet company

63
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,025
will perform "The Nutcracker Suite".

64
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,257
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

65
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:18,915
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

66
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,353
Do you know any good white
basketball players?

67
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,188
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

68
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,161
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

69
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,750
They knew I was on that train.

70
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,544
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

71
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:45,380
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

72
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,845
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

73
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,749
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

74
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,954
Time is running out.

75
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:03,790
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

76
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:08,201
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

77
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,475
That's very good.

78
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:17,214
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

79
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:20,282
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

80
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,968
What are my instructions?

81
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:28,337
Here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

82
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:36,008
Go tonight to the ballet.
Use this ticket.

83
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:40,035
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

84
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:42,433
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's

85
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:44,925
on the corner of Der Fuhrer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

86
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,802
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

87
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:51,445
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog pooh.

88
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,035
What phoney dog pooh?

89
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,774
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

90
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:03,048
And now we conclude our ceremony

91
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,883
with the singing of our
East German National Anthem.

92
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,295
HAIL, HAIL, EAST GERMANY

93
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,130
LAND OF VINE AND GRAPE,

94
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,348
LAND WHERE YOU'LL REGRET

95
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,801
AND TRY TO ESCAPE

96
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,910
NO MATTER IF YOU TUNNEL UNDER

97
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,403
OR TAKE A RUNNING JUMP
AT THE WALL,

98
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:29,608
THE GUARDS WILL KILL YOU,

99
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,910
IF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE
DOESN'T FIRST.

100
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:43,224
Driver, why are we stopped here?
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

101
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,099
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

102
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,592
Ah, yes. Mr Rivers.

103
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:43,729
I have it right here, but we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

104
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:47,084
We will be very happy
to provide you with one.

105
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,099
That'll be fine.

106
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,633
Jurgen.

107
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:54,084
This way, sir.

108
00:14:57,152 --> 00:15:00,509
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

109
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,728
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

110
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:08,564
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

111
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:10,769
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

112
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,262
But of course, mein General.

113
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:18,536
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

114
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:21,125
I will take care of it.

115
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,179
Thank you.

116
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,699
Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

117
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,247
I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.

118
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:41,452
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

119
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,535
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry, Martin.

120
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,699
Why don't you get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

121
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,863
No. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

122
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:55,452
I got them right here.

123
00:15:55,452 --> 00:16:01,013
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

124
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,123
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

125
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:34,478
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

126
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:38,313
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

127
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,614
Have you heard from Cedric?

128
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,259
He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

129
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,327
This letter has to be in New York
by T uesday.

130
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:49,915
Now, go! Quickly!

131
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,558
I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

132
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,558
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

133
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,831
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

134
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:08,255
Excuse me, this lady is with me.

135
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,707
Mr Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

136
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:15,542
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

137
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,569
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

138
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,816
- That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,501
I was looking for someone to dance with.

140
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,665
- You're an American.
- That's right.

141
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:36,829
- My uncle was born in America.
- Really?

142
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,705
But he was one of the lucky ones.

143
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:44,692
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

144
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,568
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

145
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:51,884
He would tell me about
the large houses and expensive cars.

146
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:56,294
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll.

147
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:59,074
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

148
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,568
"M*A*S*H" was OK
and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

149
00:19:01,568 --> 00:19:05,787
It just seems like young people
of America take freedom for granted.

150
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,896
Wait. I don't think you're being fair.

151
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,349
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

152
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:15,855
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

153
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:20,650
but still don't know
what it's like to have to fight for it.

154
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:42,703
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

155
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,196
I am grateful for what you did back there.

156
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:47,882
You'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell,

157
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:50,662
Disneyland on both coasts.
It's happening.

158
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,689
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

159
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,141
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

160
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,524
What do you recommend?

161
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:07,538
I recommend the pork bellies

162
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,223
marinated in diced pig entrails

163
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:13,003
or the roast swine knuckles

164
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:17,127
poached with flaming hog balls.

165
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,770
Anything's fine.

166
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:27,674
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

167
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:30,455
That's an unusual name.

168
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:35,632
It's German. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

169
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:41,482
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

170
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:44,358
Nick, what does that mean?

171
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:47,427
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

172
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,865
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

173
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,454
Some things are better left unsaid.

174
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,042
Like what?

175
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:07,563
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse.

176
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:13,795
Then you reach for your lipstick, your hand
gushes into it, and it goes all over...

177
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,193
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

178
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,946
Thank you very much.

179
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,302
Ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:30,671
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent

181
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:34,507
is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

182
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:37,767
He truly has the gift of song.

183
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,877
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

184
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,849
Is there something wrong?

185
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,151
I was afraid this might happen.

186
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:49,945
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer,

187
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:53,301
and owns a complete set of his works.

188
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:56,657
He is a very shy and gentle man,

189
00:21:56,657 --> 00:22:00,492
but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

190
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,793
Shall we ask him?

191
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:10,848
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

192
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,382
Thank you, sir.

193
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,984
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

194
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,327
Oh, my God.

195
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:45,129
Your hog balls, sir.

196
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,677
Cedric!

197
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:18,307
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

198
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:21,950
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

199
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,018
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

200
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:27,608
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

201
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:29,909
But what are we going to do?

202
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:31,059
I was...

203
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:35,757
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight,

204
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:38,539
to meet a man called "The Torch".

205
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,169
Thank you.

206
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,812
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

207
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:47,648
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

208
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,428
I must! He'll be tortured.

209
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:53,496
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

210
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:55,798
Where is the ticket?

211
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:58,195
In the glove compartment.

212
00:25:58,195 --> 00:25:59,825
Can you reach it from the inside?

213
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:05,483
How about the other hand?

214
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,811
No, that's not it. Let me try.

215
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:18,140
Here it is.

216
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:12,437
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

217
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:16,559
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

218
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:24,326
In here.

219
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,874
We can get out this way.

220
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:38,613
- Wait. First you can explain.
- I'm not sure I can.

221
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:46,859
I only know I have put you in great danger.

222
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,969
Trust me. You must come with me.

223
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:52,421
I don't know what trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

224
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:55,298
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

225
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,790
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

226
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,777
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

227
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:32,598
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

228
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,447
Nick, I've tried everything.

229
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:41,707
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

230
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:45,542
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

231
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,803
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

232
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,405
That's a shame, Martin.

233
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,514
Have you tried one of these?

234
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:02,418
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

235
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:09,322
I'm getting worried about this place.
I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

236
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:12,582
All I know is, after you left the cafe
last night, I met a girl.

237
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:15,075
Later at the ballet she was alone.

238
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,761
Then I see this guy with a gun at her head.

239
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:21,596
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and might have if I hadn't stepped in.

240
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:26,295
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this mess out.

241
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:30,130
I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

242
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:33,102
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

243
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:37,513
Just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

244
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,059
Amen.

245
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,799
We wish to impress upon you, Mr Rivers,

246
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,442
that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

247
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:41,277
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

248
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:45,113
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

249
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:50,674
Might I remind you, Mr Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

250
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:54,510
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

251
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:01,413
It is the hospital, mein General.

252
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:05,249
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

253
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:11,098
I see. Let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

254
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,496
He is dead.

255
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:21,933
You leave me no alternative,
but to introduce two of my associates.

256
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:27,111
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

257
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,385
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

258
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:35,741
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness

259
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,946
however long they may work on him.

260
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:39,864
You don't scare me.

261
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:42,837
My manager is on his way
to the American Consulate.

262
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,905
Do not be so sure, Mr Rivers.

263
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:48,014
Evidently, your friend did not realise

264
00:32:48,014 --> 00:32:51,659
that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

265
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,973
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

266
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,082
Our surgeons did what they could

267
00:32:58,082 --> 00:33:02,686
but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

268
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,246
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

269
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:22,246
Make sure they leave no marks.

270
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,423
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

271
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:51,588
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

272
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:54,272
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

273
00:33:54,272 --> 00:34:00,122
No, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

274
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,998
I can't believe I'm back in school.

275
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:07,792
Thank God.

276
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,217
Well?

277
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:17,380
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

278
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,778
They've tried everything.

279
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:22,463
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

280
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:26,298
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

281
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:28,696
We'll break him tomorrow.

282
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,323
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

283
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:50,966
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

284
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:56,720
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you.

285
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,171
A year ago, I was close to perfecting

286
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:03,527
the first magnetic desalinisation process.

287
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:07,363
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt

288
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:11,006
from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

289
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:14,842
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

290
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,540
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

291
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:23,471
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

292
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:26,732
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

293
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:29,417
and brought me to this dungeon.

294
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,047
That sucks!

295
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,828
For the first time in my life,

296
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:38,142
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

297
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:41,978
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

298
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:45,430
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

299
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,306
But they are holding my daughter.

300
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,621
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

301
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:55,978
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

302
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:58,950
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

303
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,347
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

304
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,553
Is this the Polaris mine?

305
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:08,347
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

306
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:11,702
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine

307
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:16,114
so powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

308
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:19,661
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

309
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:30,304
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

310
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,469
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

311
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,208
Right away.

312
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,989
- Von Horst!
- Ja, mein General.

313
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:49,961
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

314
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:52,647
Mr Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

315
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:55,427
He is to be executed this very minute.

316
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:59,262
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
- Ja, mein General.

317
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,882
Those bikes!

318
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,512
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

319
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:54,977
They're in the Eastern sector.

320
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:57,182
I want the whole area sealed off!

321
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,551
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

322
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,277
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

323
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:22,784
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

324
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:27,194
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

325
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:30,359
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

326
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,249
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

327
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,125
at the University of Blaupunkt.

328
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:43,400
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

329
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,564
I've been trying to find him ever since.

330
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:50,304
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

331
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:52,988
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

332
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:55,385
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

333
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,878
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

334
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:00,947
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

335
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:04,303
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

336
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:47,069
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

337
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:07,588
May I help you?

338
00:45:08,643 --> 00:45:10,848
My father is Dr. Paul Flammond

339
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:14,587
I'm sorry. I don't know a Dr. Flammond.

340
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:19,478
He told me you may have a book of
Swedish poems by Von Brieson.

341
00:45:21,587 --> 00:45:24,080
So you are Hillary Flammond!

342
00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:31,368
What can I do for you?

343
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,436
We must speak with "The Torch".

344
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:36,450
That will be very difficult.

345
00:45:44,312 --> 00:45:46,902
But I will try to arrange it.

346
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,066
Can we leave tonight?

347
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:56,586
It is too dangerous to travel at night.

348
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:02,339
You will be taken in the morning
to a potato farm.

349
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,737
Where can we stay tonight?

350
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:06,559
There is a loft upstairs.

351
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,955
You can use that fire pole.

352
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:28,037
That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

353
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:30,146
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

354
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:33,118
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

355
00:46:33,118 --> 00:46:37,434
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

356
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:40,118
Can you believe they print this trash?

357
00:46:40,118 --> 00:46:43,571
Don't worry about it. You were going
to tell me something about your childhood.

358
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:48,365
When I was a young girl,

359
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:50,953
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

360
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:52,968
But there was a terrible storm

361
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:55,365
and the boat sank.

362
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:57,858
I managed to swim to a deserted island

363
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:00,254
with a young boy, named Nigel.

364
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:02,652
Together we had to learn to survive.

365
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:08,117
Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

366
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,994
which Nigel would catch every day.

367
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,063
Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

368
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:18,665
from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

369
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:22,405
We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

370
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:24,898
with dried seaweed and snot.

371
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:28,062
This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

372
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:30,938
but sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

373
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:33,815
which would periodically
ravage the island.

374
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:36,500
The years passed and as we grew up,

375
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,006
we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

376
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:43,500
There was no one around to explain this.

377
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,184
We had to learn by ourselves.

378
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:17,251
Then one day he went fishing.

379
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:20,704
That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

380
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:23,772
I spent months by myself on that island,

381
00:48:23,772 --> 00:48:27,224
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

382
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:29,813
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

383
00:48:29,813 --> 00:48:32,018
You can't imagine what it's like

384
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:34,128
to be separated from your family

385
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:36,237
at such a young age.

386
00:48:36,237 --> 00:48:37,867
I think I can.

387
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:46,017
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

388
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:50,525
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

389
00:48:50,525 --> 00:48:53,017
They tried to page her,

390
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,990
but the PA system was on the fritz.

391
00:48:57,044 --> 00:49:00,017
I never saw my momma again.

392
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:02,798
Some people
from the cosmetics department

393
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:05,099
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

394
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,208
Days stretched into weeks.

395
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:09,414
One February they got jammed up

396
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:12,099
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

397
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:14,496
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

398
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:19,387
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

399
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:22,455
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

400
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:26,002
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

401
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:29,838
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

402
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,523
It went something like this.

403
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,301
Oh, Nick.

404
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:30,655
All right, this is it.

405
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,668
I must leave you here.

406
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:36,217
Go now, quickly.

407
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:42,161
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

408
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:44,271
He's just a little hoarse.

409
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,285
Giddy-up, Mario.

410
00:51:57,983 --> 00:52:00,763
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

411
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:04,983
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

412
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:07,955
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

413
00:52:11,886 --> 00:52:13,613
Come this way.

414
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:42,762
- What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

415
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,022
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

416
00:52:46,022 --> 00:52:51,584
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

417
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:54,076
We shall see.

418
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:09,418
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

419
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:19,678
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

420
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:22,555
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

421
00:53:22,555 --> 00:53:27,157
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

422
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:30,514
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

423
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:34,157
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

424
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:37,225
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

425
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:41,061
Forgive us, Mr Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

426
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:47,005
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

427
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:50,746
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

428
00:53:50,746 --> 00:53:52,376
Very well.

429
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:59,280
This is Chevalier, Montage, Detente,

430
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,594
Avant Garde, and Déjà Vu.

431
00:54:04,457 --> 00:54:06,950
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

432
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:09,635
I don't think so.

433
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:15,771
Over there...

434
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:20,662
Croissant, Souffle, Escargot,

435
00:54:20,662 --> 00:54:22,963
and Chocolate Mousse.

436
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:32,264
Now, Mr Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

437
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:35,332
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

438
00:54:35,332 --> 00:54:38,881
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

439
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:41,182
Sacrebleu.

440
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:44,825
We'll have to move out tonight.

441
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:46,935
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

442
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:49,141
Prepare the gear for the jump.

443
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:51,058
Cordon bleu. Zut!

444
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:53,934
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

445
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:57,387
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

446
00:54:57,387 --> 00:55:00,455
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

447
00:55:00,455 --> 00:55:03,811
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

448
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:07,263
who, 15 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

449
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,427
It all sounds like some bad movie.

450
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:22,317
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

451
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:26,153
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

452
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:29,796
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

453
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:34,974
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

454
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,042
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

455
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:02,301
Life is filled with its little miseries.

456
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:06,138
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

457
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,014
in a mature and adult fashion.

458
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:23,013
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

459
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:26,369
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

460
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:34,712
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

461
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,396
He seems a good chap, really.

462
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:39,889
How wonderful you've returned to me,

463
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:43,438
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

464
00:56:43,438 --> 00:56:47,081
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

465
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:51,587
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

466
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:54,081
And by all rights I should be.

467
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,670
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

468
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,833
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

469
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,711
I tried to get them to save you too.

470
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,491
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

471
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:10,573
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

472
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:13,738
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

473
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:19,203
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

474
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,682
Latrine!

475
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:33,586
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

476
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:35,504
We never had a chance.

477
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:37,421
It was a slaughter.

478
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:40,489
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

479
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:43,654
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

480
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:48,544
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

481
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,215
Take this.

482
00:59:06,404 --> 00:59:07,554
Grenade.

483
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:22,609
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

484
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:24,718
We'll have to make a break for it.

485
00:59:24,718 --> 00:59:27,308
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

486
00:59:27,308 --> 00:59:28,362
Wait!

487
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:46,677
Nice shooting.

488
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:47,732
My man!

489
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,963
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

490
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:18,223
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1:00 am.

491
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,141
What about the American?

492
01:00:20,141 --> 01:00:22,921
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

493
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:25,894
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

494
01:00:25,894 --> 01:00:29,634
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

495
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:37,209
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

496
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:39,989
how do you say, indispensable?

497
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:41,715
Indispensable.

498
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:45,264
That's what I thought.

499
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:49,099
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

500
01:00:49,195 --> 01:00:51,496
I got a truck to meet.

501
01:00:54,373 --> 01:00:58,208
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

502
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:02,043
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

503
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:04,441
I know how you feel about me.

504
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:07,605
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

505
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:11,056
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

506
01:01:11,056 --> 01:01:14,221
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

507
01:01:14,221 --> 01:01:16,331
That's exactly what I mean.

508
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:21,316
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

509
01:01:21,316 --> 01:01:23,618
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

510
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:27,453
Latrine.

511
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,535
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

512
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:35,604
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

513
01:01:35,604 --> 01:01:37,521
Not the bird, you fool!

514
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:41,356
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

515
01:01:41,452 --> 01:01:44,042
Look, a message.

516
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:49,603
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

517
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:54,014
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

518
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:04,657
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

519
01:02:06,383 --> 01:02:08,301
No, I'm not.

520
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:11,465
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

521
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:14,342
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

522
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:17,602
I'm Mel Torme.

523
01:02:22,397 --> 01:02:24,122
That was close.

524
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:27,958
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

525
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:31,794
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

526
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:35,725
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

527
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:39,560
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

528
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,862
He came to us with no credentials.

529
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:45,697
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

530
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:48,477
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

531
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:51,163
Nigel, what are you saying?

532
01:02:52,217 --> 01:02:55,669
How do we know
he's not Mel Torme?

533
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,436
Look, he's at the jukebox.

534
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,157
This is not Mel Torme.

535
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,690
Oh, Nick.

536
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:44,622
Yes?

537
01:05:44,622 --> 01:05:48,265
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

538
01:05:48,265 --> 01:05:52,771
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

539
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:55,553
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

540
01:05:55,553 --> 01:05:57,758
You must know that when we were
together last night,

541
01:05:57,758 --> 01:06:00,442
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

542
01:06:00,442 --> 01:06:02,647
And now that you know?

543
01:06:04,182 --> 01:06:07,538
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

544
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:12,715
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

545
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:17,031
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

546
01:06:17,031 --> 01:06:20,483
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

547
01:06:24,223 --> 01:06:27,578
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

548
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:14,467
I've spotted the herd.

549
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,960
They're the key to the whole plan.

550
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,644
Now, we're here.

551
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:23,576
Every morning at 7:15

552
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:26,932
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

553
01:07:26,932 --> 01:07:29,712
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

554
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:33,453
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

555
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:38,438
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

556
01:07:38,438 --> 01:07:40,932
Then we'll break away from the other cows

557
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:43,233
and enter the generator building here.

558
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:47,835
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

559
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:51,671
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

560
01:07:51,959 --> 01:07:54,452
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

561
01:07:54,452 --> 01:07:57,807
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

562
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,972
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

563
01:08:00,972 --> 01:08:03,561
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

564
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:19,383
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

565
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:21,492
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

566
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:25,135
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

567
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:28,203
All right, be an asshole.

568
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,573
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

569
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:49,203
All right, let's go. Double time.

570
01:08:58,024 --> 01:09:01,860
We only have five minutes to get
to the circuit box and throw the switch.

571
01:09:02,148 --> 01:09:05,120
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

572
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,668
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

573
01:09:08,668 --> 01:09:11,449
I can only see one.

574
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:13,846
There girl, move along.

575
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:23,818
Stay behind the guards.

576
01:09:23,818 --> 01:09:27,366
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

577
01:09:27,366 --> 01:09:29,284
OK, now!

578
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,735
I think we did it.

579
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:40,790
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

580
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,379
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

581
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:46,159
Mon Dieu!

582
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:54,501
Nigel, you OK?

583
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:56,324
Oh, yeah.

584
01:09:56,324 --> 01:09:58,241
Let's go.

585
01:09:58,241 --> 01:10:02,939
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

586
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,008
I just wanted to take a...rest.

587
01:10:23,747 --> 01:10:27,295
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

588
01:10:27,295 --> 01:10:29,980
Three more minutes.

589
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,185
Then we can cut the wire.

590
01:10:55,774 --> 01:10:57,787
There it is.

591
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,114
Lovely.

592
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:03,278
You're all right now. I'm here.

593
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:05,962
It's all right.

594
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:13,538
Hey.

595
01:12:32,044 --> 01:12:33,098
Here, here.

596
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:42,112
Vive la France!

597
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:58,699
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

598
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:01,193
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

599
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:05,028
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

600
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:07,905
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

601
01:13:09,534 --> 01:13:12,891
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

602
01:13:12,891 --> 01:13:17,589
So, it is you who is the traitor!

603
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:36,671
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

604
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:39,452
Now, get over there and...

605
01:13:47,985 --> 01:13:50,575
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

606
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:53,068
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

607
01:13:53,068 --> 01:13:55,752
Thank God, but how ironic.

608
01:13:55,752 --> 01:13:59,588
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

609
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,835
Nice work.

610
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:32,093
Nigel.

611
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,203
Very clever, my darling.

612
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,888
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

613
01:14:36,888 --> 01:14:40,436
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

614
01:14:40,436 --> 01:14:44,271
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

615
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,436
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

616
01:14:47,436 --> 01:14:50,600
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

617
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,517
Comrades?

618
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:56,545
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

619
01:14:56,545 --> 01:14:59,901
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

620
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:03,736
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

621
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:06,134
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

622
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:09,777
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.

623
01:15:33,556 --> 01:15:35,762
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

624
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:37,680
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

625
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:47,077
What happened?

626
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:51,871
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

627
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:54,556
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

628
01:15:55,611 --> 01:15:58,871
And what does he want us to do now?

629
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:01,459
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

630
01:16:28,596 --> 01:16:30,321
Latrine!

631
01:16:32,431 --> 01:16:36,267
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

632
01:16:36,363 --> 01:16:39,335
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

633
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:42,883
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

634
01:16:42,883 --> 01:16:45,088
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

635
01:16:45,088 --> 01:16:48,732
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 18:00.

636
01:16:48,732 --> 01:16:52,087
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

637
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:54,389
especially at this time of year.

638
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:57,170
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

639
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,704
Good luck.

640
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:11,073
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

641
01:19:33,657 --> 01:19:35,670
Goodbye.

642
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:07,984
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

643
01:20:07,984 --> 01:20:10,190
I will not leave without my daughter.

644
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:13,066
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn

645
01:20:13,066 --> 01:20:16,614
and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

646
01:20:16,614 --> 01:20:18,628
There they are!

647
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:26,299
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

648
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:29,271
How I feared I would never see you again.

649
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,668
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

650
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:35,312
There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

651
01:20:35,312 --> 01:20:38,476
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

652
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:43,078
I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower

653
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:45,189
under the iron fist of oppression,

654
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:47,298
as long as a child cries out in the night,

655
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:51,612
or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

656
01:20:51,612 --> 01:20:53,050
No, Hillary.

657
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:56,024
It is too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

658
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:59,092
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

659
01:20:59,092 --> 01:21:01,776
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

660
01:21:01,776 --> 01:21:05,612
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

661
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,735
And as long as we do,
we know we are not alone in our fight.

662
01:21:10,023 --> 01:21:13,571
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

663
01:21:13,571 --> 01:21:16,927
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything will be fine.

664
01:21:16,927 --> 01:21:22,583
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

665
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,598
I want you to be with me.

666
01:21:24,598 --> 01:21:28,433
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

667
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:32,364
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say it now.

668
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:37,734
Want!
Want more than anything!

669
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:40,610
Take me. Take me with you!

670
01:21:53,268 --> 01:21:57,582
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

671
01:21:57,582 --> 01:22:01,226
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

672
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:06,404
Goodbye, Déjà Vu.
I will always remember you.

673
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,239
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.
