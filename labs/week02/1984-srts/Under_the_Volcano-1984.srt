1
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,211
Anda, perro. ˇQuítese!

2
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,323
Buenas tardes

3
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,749
Why are you afraid of me?

4
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,580
I love you. I love you.

5
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,746
You came to life for me.

6
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,051
Don't you know me?

7
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,059
Buenas noches, doctor

8
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,925
- Ah. Buenas noches, seńor Geoffrey
- Buenas noches

9
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,930
Just in time. Exactamente

10
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,023
The inglés is always by the clock.

11
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,037
You go to the Red Cross, I think.

12
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,943
Mm-mmm. It's good.

13
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,706
Very good.

14
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,179
But, no, there is something wrong.

15
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,779
I know, seńor.
You have no socks.

16
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,291
Quite. No socks.

17
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,336
With that espléndida vestimenta,
there must be socks.

18
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:55,567
- You want I should bring you?
- No. Gracias Not necessary.

19
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,702
By the way, seńor Bustamante,
did you find any letters -

20
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,303
cartas - any letters addressed to me?

21
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,782
No. No, seńor.
I find no letters for you.

22
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,381
What letters have you lost?

23
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,516
From my wife.

24
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,823
From Yvonne.

25
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,228
You have heard from her then.
What does she say?

26
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,494
Is she coming back to Mexico?

27
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,901
No. I don't think so.

28
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,371
I'm sorry to see you apart.

29
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,342
I have always great admiration
for seńora Yvonne.

30
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,276
I think she comes back.

31
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,178
She writes to you,
then she will come back.

32
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,459
I also received a letter
from her lawyer.

33
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,629
It seems we're divorced now.

34
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,893
Uy, amigo

35
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,026
- Is this true?
- Yes.

36
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,773
It's true.

37
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,238
Let me go!

38
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,815
- I promise to come back
- You are lying

39
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,477
- No!
- You won't come back

40
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,613
- You hate me You despise me
- No No

41
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,214
Liar! Hypocrite!

42
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,836
Las Manos de Orlac.
The Hands of Orlac, no?

43
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,838
It's a good story.

44
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,774
A man is a pianist,
but loses his hands under a train.

45
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,779
Is given him another,
but they are the hands of a killer.

46
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,782
Uh, these hands murder people.

47
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:49,548
But his heart does not,
and he's very, very sorry.

48
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,751
Some things you can't apologize for.

49
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,987
The fate of all the world is changed, I think.

50
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,427
Only in Mexico
is death an occasion for laughter.

51
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:08,633
On Day of the Dead,
when their spirits come back to us...

52
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,871
the road from heaven
must be made - made easy...

53
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,947
and not slippery with tears.

54
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,244
Sorry, old girl.
They won't let you into this occasion.

55
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,147
Your gown's cut far too low.

56
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,083
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

57
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,854
- How are you?
- You know the doctor.

58
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,464
Poquito de brandy.

59
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,591
Poquito de anís

60
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,000
Poquito de tequila

61
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,598
Mmm. Poquito de whiskey.

62
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,608
Poquito de mezcal

63
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,645
Oh, no, no. No mescal.
Never touch mescal.

64
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,842
I'd go thirsty
before drinking mescal.

65
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,612
Is loco.
Mescal is just the tequila of the poor.

66
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,654
Mescal is for the damned.

67
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,555
Oh, good Christ.
Last blast of diplomacy coming up.

68
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,427
- Buenas noches, seńor Firmin
- Buenas noches

69
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,059
I wish to introduce to you
Herr Krausberg, German attaché.

70
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,332
Herr Krausberg, Mr. Firmin.

71
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,408
Former British Consul to Cuernavaca.

72
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,703
It's a great pleasure for me
to meet you, Mr. Firmin.

73
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,405
- Same, I'm sure.
- Un cocktail de champagne

74
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,882
I hope your next, uh, post
will be as beautiful as Cuernavaca.

75
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,385
- Nothing next. I've retired.
- Oh, have you really?

76
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,447
"Cut is the branch that might have grown
full straight," or something like that.

77
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,551
I'm going to stay on here in Mexico.

78
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,495
Oh, how fortunate for me.

79
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,964
I hope to have a friendship with you...

80
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,867
as close, as cordial, as the friendship
between our two nations.

81
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,067
Actually, Herr Krausberg,
you may be able to do me a great service.

82
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,609
I would be very happy to help
in whatever way I can.

83
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,611
It's to do with my brother-
half brother.

84
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,681
- Do you understand "half brother"?
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,115
F-Father remarried
an American Southern beauty.

86
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,586
Hugh. Uh, newspaperman.
Freelance sort of stuff.

87
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,954
He's chasing some rumor down
right now.

88
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,859
- But you may be able to shed some light.
- Most gladly, if I can.

89
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,797
Is Germany financing a Nazi movement
here in Mexico?

90
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,328
- Of course not. Your brother, Mr. Firmin -
- Half. Half.

91
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,703
Half. Sorry. Your half brother...

92
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,675
obviously suffers
from an overactive imagination.

93
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,338
Called the sinarquistas,
if I'm not mistaken.

94
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,974
Nonsense. It's just a rumor, as you said.

95
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,918
In any case,
we are allies now, aren't we?

96
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,517
Since that marvelous agreement between
your prime minister and our führer.

97
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,755
So, let's drink together, shall we?

98
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,264
To, uh -To the understanding of our nations.

99
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,861
It is a union I'm, uh, convinced...

100
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,735
that will assure peace
for many, many years to come.

101
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,809
Prost, Herr Firmin.

102
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,273
Yes, quite.
The Munich Pact and all that.

103
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,748
"Peace in our time."
But let's not be too hasty.

104
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:44,380
Let's hedge our bets, what?
After all, the Mexican railroad has.

105
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,924
They don't mean to be taken by surprise.

106
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,895
Just take a look at their newest timetable -
at the fine print.

107
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,491
Corpses must be transported by express.

108
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,934
Each of these express corpses...

109
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:03,372
must be accompanied
by a first-class passenger.

110
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:08,276
Now, let's suppose, uh, the treaty fails
and it's bloody Armageddon.

111
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,041
- Just think of it.
- You -You -

112
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,980
Railways stand to make a fortune.

113
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,245
- You're right. You're right.
- But just think of it.

114
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,221
All of those bloody corpses,
each holding a first-class ticket.

115
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,019
Absolutely.

116
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,060
One Day of the Dead won't be enough.

117
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,529
Month. Decade.

118
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,430
Age of the Dead, more like it!

119
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,868
The whole world
will learn to laugh...

120
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,066
at the sight of stinking cadavers.

121
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,576
Oh, ha, ha.
Bloody ha, ha, ha!

122
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,578
Oh, good God.

123
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,582
Express trains will be booked up
years in advance.

124
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:50,553
Corpses hand in hand
with bloody first-class ticket holders...

125
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,820
standing in lines for miles
waiting for transport.

126
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,827
Aha. Yes.

127
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,157
Ladies and gentlemen of the Red Cross...

128
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,066
you have your bloody work
cut out for you.

129
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,264
- Arranging storage of, uh -
- Amigo. Seńor.

130
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,605
Storage for this bumper crop
of dancing carcasses.

131
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,941
- Seńor Geoffrey.
- Build special depots.

132
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,641
Uh, stack them in layers.

133
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,980
Or squeeze - squeeze them in upright.

134
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,610
No, better still - cut them in pieces.

135
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,657
Chop them up
and stash them in sacks.

136
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,592
- And paint red crosses on them.
- Come, seńor.

137
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,422
Come, amigo.
Throw away your mind.

138
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:40,233
It is sad to spend your life
in such continual tragedies.

139
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,175
Ah, it's not in the times, of course,
but in the heart.

140
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,146
No se puede vivir sin amar

141
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,582
Uh. No se puede vivir sin amar

142
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,421
Hmm. I woke up one morning,
she was gone.

143
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:05,091
Nothing. Just a bloody note.

144
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,324
I need her.

145
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,561
Come. I know what you must do.

146
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,570
Come with me.
It is not far. Come.

147
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,010
She is the Virgin of Soledad.

148
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,871
La santa patrona

149
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,146
for those who have nobody with

150
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,651
and those what are lost...

151
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,759
and mariners at sea.

152
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,499
You must ask...

153
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
for your esposa again.

154
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,763
Ask her.

155
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,240
I can't.

156
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,842
It's like asking my fairy godmother
for three wishes.

157
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:14,081
You must forgive my compańero

158
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,454
He's too borracho to pray.

159
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:26,632
No se puede vivir sin amar, Madrecita

160
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,908
And he -

161
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,837
He - He has lost his esposa

162
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,475
And he ask for your help.

163
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,853
Please.

164
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,017
Pray to the Virgin.

165
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm dying without you.

166
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,342
Come back to me, Yvonne.

167
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,740
Are you listening, Fernando?

168
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,375
Si es absolutamente necesario

169
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,217
Pay close attention.
A lesson. A parable.

170
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,884
I'm telling you about responsibility,
Fernando.

171
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,655
Si es absolutamente necesario

172
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:02,928
This ship was a thoroughgoing lie...

173
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,061
and I was the commanding officer.

174
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:12,408
This ship - the S. S. Samaritan

175
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,411
it was called...

176
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:20,213
looked from the outside
like a harmless, fat old lady-

177
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,149
a laden freighter
lying heavy on the sea.

178
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,716
Are you listening, Fernando?

179
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,743
Chamacos

180
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,431
sink anything the Germans
might send our way!

181
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,130
It was 1917, spring.

182
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,611
We sight a periscope sighting us.

183
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,015
Are you listening, Fernando?

184
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,018
They prepare to board us.

185
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,655
Then the big surprise.

186
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,466
Are you listening, Fernando?

187
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,775
Oh.

188
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,245
We drop our disguise.

189
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,145
The predator suddenly becomes the prey.

190
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,657
I got a medal for capturing that sub.

191
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,791
But first I had to be tried
at a court-martial.

192
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,098
The mystery
of the missing German officers.

193
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,172
You see...

194
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,334
the remains of seven men...

195
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,708
were found in the furnace ashes.

196
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,816
Rather gruesome, hmm?

197
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,891
It just isn't done, Fernando.

198
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:45,190
People just don't go around
putting other people into furnaces.

199
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,632
Hmm. Yvonne.

200
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,634
I'm back.

201
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,374
- Is it really you?
- Of course it's me.

202
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,244
Can't be.

203
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:11,145
I wrote you I was coming.
Didn't you get my letters?

204
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,725
I wasn't even sure you were still here.
I had to call the Foreign Office.

205
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,694
I am always more or less here.

206
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,790
Uh, I did go away, uh, once,
just last week.

207
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,426
To a bullfight, in Tomalin.

208
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,437
Wound up in El Farolito.

209
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,939
But just for drinks, mind you

210
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,967
How did you get here?

211
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,675
I came by, uh, boat from New York.

212
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,982
- I caught a plane from Veracruz.
- I see.

213
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,283
You must be exhausted.

214
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:51,953
Not really. I had a million hours
of sleep on the boat.

215
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,260
The worst part
was the ride from the airfield.

216
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,267
A bus.

217
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:14,181
It's the shakes that make this life
insupportable.

218
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,917
But they subside, if handled properly...

219
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:23,893
with the necessary swigs,
the therapeutic touch.

220
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:30,532
- Have a drink with me.
- No, you have one. I'll cheer.

221
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,721
- Calle Nicaragua 52
- Sí, seńora

222
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,618
How, unless you drink as I do...

223
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,024
can you hope to understand the beauty
of an old Indian woman...

224
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,119
playing dominoes with a chicken?

225
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,344
Well, the taxis seem
to have all disappeared.

226
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,322
- Shall we walk?
- Why? What's happened to the car?

227
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,495
You haven't smashed it up again,
have you?

228
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,589
Well, as a matter of fact,
I lost it.

229
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,600
- You lost it?
- Mmm.

230
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,762
Look here, dash it all,
you must be terribly tired, Yvonne.

231
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,897
Let's not walk.
Let's sit and wait for a taxi.

232
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,601
No, not at all. I would think
that you're the one who's tired.

233
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,111
Oh, no, no. Fine here.

234
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:28,417
Glad to get some circulation
going in the old legs.

235
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,689
Did they tell you, the Foreign Office,
that I'd resigned?

236
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,124
What happened?

237
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,127
Just fed up.

238
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,693
Geoffrey, why didn't you
answer my letters?

239
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,363
Shakes, you know.
Bit unsteady with a pen.

240
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,742
You might have hired him

241
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,743
Dear Yvonne...

242
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,941
I'm taking the easy, only way out -
Semicolon.

243
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,744
Good-bye - Full stop.

244
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,184
Change of paragraph.
Change of chapter.

245
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,784
Change of world.

246
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,002
# How sweetly blooms the graves #

247
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,097
#With fragrant flowers #

248
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,042
#Just once a year
the dead live for the day #

249
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,546
Do you remember that Strauss song,
Geoffrey, called "All Soul's Day"?

250
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:38,181
# Return to me, my love
that I may hold you #

251
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,716
#As once in May #

252
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,593
#As once in May ##

253
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:53,736
What have you been doing for the past year
besides getting a divorce?

254
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,502
Mostly I was in New York.

255
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,170
I got a part in a revival
of The Italian Straw Hat

256
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,739
Remember-
the play I was in when we met?

257
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,114
I was the ingenue then.

258
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,449
Afraid those days are gone.

259
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,855
This time, I only had a character part.
We closed last week.

260
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,859
I see.

261
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,001
Look, his eyes are closed.
The horse knows his way home.

262
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,950
- Gracias
- Gracias, gracias

263
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,390
Oh, hello, hello!
Look who comes here!

264
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,227
My little Oedipuss.

265
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,233
Hello!

266
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,928
Oh, there you are.

267
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,237
- Do you think he's forgotten me?
- No, he's not forgotten you.

268
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,738
I never believed it - that cats are not
attached to people but to places.

269
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,751
I've missed you, Oedipuss.

270
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,820
He's missed you too.

271
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,052
ˇSeńora, qué gusto!

272
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,490
- Oh!
- Buenos días

273
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,654
- Buenos días, Concepta
- Cómo la he extrańado

274
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,130
Oh, I've missed you too, Concepta.

275
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,106
What happened to my beautiful garden,
my camellias?

276
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,270
It became a bit of a jungle, I'm afraid

277
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,848
But look here,
just suppose for argument's sake

278
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,747
that you, uh, abandoned a besieged town

279
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,618
and somehow or other,
not long afterwards, you come back

280
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:56,353
You can't well expect to invite yourself
into the same green graces

281
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,760
quite the same, uh, oh

282
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,833
dear old welcome here and there,
can you, hmm?

283
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,906
Have you come back,
or are you just visiting?

284
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,977
I'm here, aren't I?

285
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,483
Hugh! Come out here!

286
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,485
You'll never guess who's just popped in

287
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,182
- Is Hugh here?
- Oh. Didn't I tell you?

288
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,191
Oh, he's been back some time.

289
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,454
He came straight
from the Spanish Civil War.

290
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,655
Been playing Florence Nightingale for me.

291
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,891
Hugh. Where are you?

292
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,231
He was quite disappointed when he got back
and, uh, discovered you'd flown the coop.

293
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,170
I do believe he's missed you
full as much as I.

294
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,039
Hugh. Where are you?
Where can the young pup be?

295
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:50,376
Hugh! An emissary calls.

296
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,678
The Consul of Cuckold's Haven.

297
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,346
Come and give the wife
a "welcome back" kiss.

298
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,693
Oh, I forgot. He's in Mexico City.
Be back some time today.

299
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,560
He'd gotten a wind of some,
uh, rumor, and he -

300
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,861
he chased off
like a hound after a hare.

301
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,477
Geoffrey. Just tell me.
I can go.

302
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:28,917
This is Hugh's home cure for alcoholism.

303
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,920
Strychnine.

304
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,855
He bribes Concepta to poison me.

305
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,085
- Veneno
- Seńora, eso no es verdad

306
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,530
- It's dreadful.
- It is.

307
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:44,891
Uh, would you like a whiskey?

308
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,138
I haven't had breakfast yet.

309
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,550
Geoffrey?

310
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,149
- Geoffrey. Take it.
- What?

311
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,349
For God's sake, drink it.
I'm not expecting miracles.

312
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:12,760
No, no, no, no. I'll stick to the old,
uh, medicine, thank you.

313
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,206
- Have you really resigned?
- Absolutely.

314
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,282
No more diplomacy for me.

315
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,982
Well, then there's nothing really
holding you here anymore.

316
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,055
Magic.

317
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:43,116
"He on whose heart
the dust of Mexico has lain...

318
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,923
will find no peace
in any other land "

319
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,464
But nothing's really holding you.

320
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,330
There's nothing more real than magic.

321
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,401
All right, Geoffrey, we can
talk about it when you're rested.

322
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,407
When I'm sober, you mean

323
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,036
Surely you know by this time that I can't
get drunk, however much I drink...

324
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,547
and that I'm only drunk in the conventional,
incoherent staggering sense...

325
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,016
when I haven't had a drink

326
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,783
Surely you appreciate the, mmm -
the fine balance I must strike...

327
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:18,192
between the, uh, shakes of too little
and, uh, the abyss of too much.

328
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,158
- I do appreciate it.
- Yes. Quite. Well.

329
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,672
Well, I'd like to have a bath.

330
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,037
Have your drink.

331
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,077
Ah.

332
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,253
Concepta!

333
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,551
- Seńor
- Tequila, por favor

334
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,559
- No hay nada que tomar
- Nothing?

335
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,152
Nada

336
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,535
- Ah, good morning, Quincey.
- What's good about it?

337
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,840
I have just been
inspecting my paradise.

338
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:27,179
I half expected to see Adam
come riding out of it on a tiger.

339
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,049
- On a what?
- On a tiger.

340
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,352
I would imagine -
lots of tigers and pink elephants too.

341
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,450
- About your cat, Firmin -
- I've been giving a lot of thought to Eden

342
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,554
Finding a path back to our origins.

343
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:46,160
Perhaps I'll go and live among the Indians,
like William Blackstone...

344
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,999
stripped of useless trappings.

345
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,703
Unaccommodated man - the thing itself.
You know about Blackstone?

346
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,578
My wife and I are kept awake half the night
with its infernal howling.

347
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,084
- Or don't you hear it?
- Blackstone's a character I've always admired.

348
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:05,781
He lived peacefully
among the Indians, in, uh -

349
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,723
somewhere in what is now Massachusetts.

350
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,386
But the-the Puritans found him...

351
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,931
and tried to-to coax him back
to a respectable life.

352
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,399
If you don't do something
about your cat, I will.

353
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:22,996
But Blackstone didn't like the Puritans.
Oh, no. No, he didn't.

354
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,905
He'd have none of them.

355
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,810
So he went further
into the wilderness...

356
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,508
never to be heard from again.

357
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,984
I'll strangle that damn cat
with my bare hands

358
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:44,187
Don't worry, Quincey.
Oedipuss only howled for Yvonne.

359
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,263
And she's come back.

360
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,502
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

361
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,601
- Cat
- Cat who?

362
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,976
Cat-astrophe.

363
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,981
Catastrophe who?

364
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:10,611
Oh, uh, cat-astrophysicist?

365
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,291
- Have a bite of breakfast?
- I already partook.

366
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,963
- You look weary.
- No, I'm fine.

367
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,736
Hah.

368
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,208
You've always done that -

369
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,772
always carefully cradled
your lemon wedges.

370
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,783
So meticulous.

371
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,738
Oh.

372
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,805
Do you remember the names of the months,
the Mayan months?

373
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,018
- Pop
- Mm-hmm. Uo

374
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:22,091
- Zotz
- Uh, Tzed Xal

375
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,184
Yaxkin

376
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,525
Mac Isn't there one called Mac?

377
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,326
There's Yax and Zac

378
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,526
"In receipt of yours, dated Zac the first"?

379
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:39,505
My favorite was always uayeb-

380
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,547
the poor little month
that only had five days.

381
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,357
I've wanted you back so badly.

382
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,032
I'll do anything.
I'll stop drinking.

383
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,664
I'll do anything for you.

384
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,243
It's us. It's - It's us again.

385
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,892
Oh, Geoffrey!

386
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,778
I'm sorry.

387
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,872
It isn't any good, I'm afraid.

388
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,489
Stay.

389
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,046
Where are you, old man?

390
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,855
Hello, Hugh.

391
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,192
Yvonne.

392
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,871
Well, how absolutely...
something or other.

393
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,751
Geoffrey told me you were here.

394
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,989
Did he?

395
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,786
He did.

396
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,566
You look awfully well.

397
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,102
You too. Quite a get-up.

398
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,639
- Like the Ringo Kid.
- With a touch of Savile Row.

399
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,731
- I thought you were in Spain.
- I was.

400
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,834
- What happened?
- What?

401
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,044
Why did you leave?
The war's not over yet, is it?

402
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,677
Why, I was sort of wounded.

403
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,015
Hugh.

404
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,990
On the way to watch the battle for Madrid.
Fell out of an ambulance.

405
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,187
Seven cases ofbeer and six journalists
fell on top of me

406
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,262
Ah, it's a lost cause by now anyway

407
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,272
Franco has all the soldiers
and the tanks and the aeroplanes...

408
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,467
and all the Loyalists seem to have
are good songs.

409
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,604
# Sólo es nuestro deseo #

410
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,343
# Rumbala, rumbala, rumbala ##

411
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,147
- When did you get here?
- Just this morning.

412
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,724
Well, where is he -

413
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,655
our monarch?

414
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,696
He's gone out.
For a bottle, I believe.

415
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,070
You just... appeared?

416
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,969
- What?
- No warning.

417
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,043
No, I wrote.

418
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,113
Still I -

419
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,878
I think I...
caught him by surprise.

420
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,687
- How did he react?
- Glad to see me, I think.

421
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,786
I'm sure he was.

422
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,600
- How do you find him?
- His drinking, you mean?

423
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:37,197
- Well, yes, his drinking.
- Half the time, I can't tell when he's tight.

424
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,276
He has the constitution
of a bull, you know

425
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,368
He's gone down, I think.

426
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:46,916
Well, now you've come back like this...

427
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,518
perhaps he'll stop.

428
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,425
Yeah.

429
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,010
Look here, is everything all right?

430
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,172
I say.
I say, what's the matter here?

431
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,775
Nothing. Absolutely all right.

432
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,377
All right? But you were lying down
in the middle of the road.

433
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,856
All right just the same.
Thank you very much.

434
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,951
My dear fellow, you were lying right down here
I might have run you over

435
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,223
- Are you sure there's nothing wrong?
- No.

436
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,925
What? Are you sure you're all right?

437
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,002
Oh.

438
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,576
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Oxford?

439
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,339
- No. Cambridge.
- You're wearing an Oxford tie.

440
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:53,143
Oh, the tie. That belongs to my cousin.
We're headed for Guatemala.

441
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,651
We're making a little tour of the temples,
don't you know?

442
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,120
- Splendid country, isn't it?
- Splendid.

443
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:03,023
Look, are you absolutely sure
there are no bones broken?

444
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,425
No, no bones broken -

445
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,054
Oh, my dear fellow.
My dear fellow. Here.

446
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,696
Now, listen.
We are staying at the Bella Vista.

447
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,865
Why don't we pop back to the hotel,
and you can have a little bit of a lie-down?

448
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,034
- No, fine, thank you.
- No?

449
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,477
Well, I always keep something
in the car for emergencies.

450
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,781
Irish. Burke's Irish.

451
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,051
Mmm. Thanks a million.

452
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,890
- No, no. Carry on, my dear fellow. Carry on.
- Ah. Mmm.

453
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,201
Awfully decent of you, old chap.

454
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,603
I say. I know where I last saw you.

455
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,198
You were that chap
who made that speech last night.

456
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,835
- Is that right, old man?
- Quite right.

457
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,779
Didn't really get through to me completely,
but you sounded jolly good.

458
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:02,978
Look, if you're absolutely sure that you're
feeling all right, I'd better be pushing off.

459
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,953
- Top hole.
- Don't go falling into roads anymore, will you?

460
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:09,025
You might get run over or run in. Ha, ha.

461
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,424
- Bloody awful road, isn't it?
- Dreadful. Dreadful.

462
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,520
Yes, yes. The weather's splendid.
Cheerio.

463
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,600
Let me know if you're ever
in any kind of jam.

464
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,337
- Tallyho!
- Tallyho!

465
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:53,401
Hey, Hugh!
You old snake in the grass.

466
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:57,303
- Hello, Geoff, old man
- Quite a surprise, huh, Yvonne appearing like this?

467
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,307
Calls for a celebration.

468
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,436
God, I forgot. I haven't got a drop in the house.
What kind of a host does that make me?

469
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,448
I just popped out for the champagne,
bumped into an old college chum.

470
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,246
Maudlin man.
Sit down, you two.

471
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,186
Did you tell Hugh
about your return to the stage?

472
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,484
She's made a comeback.
Great success.

473
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,889
Hugh's looking well, isn't he? Huh?

474
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,622
Mexico agrees with him.
Brown as a berry.

475
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,597
Why, he's been taking
splendid care of me.

476
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,259
And I do believe
results are beginning to show.

477
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,428
I feel strong as a horse.
Strong as a horse.

478
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:31,166
All due to Hugh's wonder drug.
Kill or cure.

479
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:34,676
Oh, we could all have a strychnine.

480
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,713
Excuse me, will you?
Uh, I'll, um -

481
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,941
Amuse yourselves
for a few moments.

482
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,484
I'll, uh, tidy up a bit.

483
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,520
Aah.

484
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,092
Yvonne, forgive my asking like this...

485
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,358
but, uh, have you
really come back to him?

486
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,601
Or what?

487
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,939
I mean, I'd just... like to know
precisely what the situation is.

488
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,470
- So would I.
- You don't know?

489
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,048
Yes. I've come back to him.

490
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,959
All right?

491
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,397
All right?

492
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,079
- Right here, old man.
- Oh, Geoffrey.

493
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,445
Upsy-daisy. There we go.

494
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,576
Can't stop bouncing about.

495
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,627
- I wonder what this is like.
- Geoffrey!

496
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,325
Not bad. Not bad.
Slightly under proof.

497
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,333
A little like Pernod.

498
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,461
Still, it keeps
the galloping cockroaches at bay.

499
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,870
Oh. Oh!

500
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,942
Into the shower.

501
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,550
No hot water!

502
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:29,755
Little cockroach on the wall...

503
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,454
ain't you got no one at all?

504
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,836
Ah. Allow me.

505
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,871
Ooh. Oh!

506
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,582
- Feeling better?
- New man. Revived.

507
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,085
No past, only future.

508
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,156
Now be still.

509
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:10,663
Oh, hey. No, listen.
We ought to go to the fiesta.

510
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:17,200
- What, now?
- Yes, it will be all, all gone tomorrow.

511
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:21,141
I mean, we ought to,
unless, of course, you're too fagged.

512
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,973
No, I'm fine.

513
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,947
Now hold still.
I'm doing your neck.

514
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:30,986
"Don't be careful,"
as the Mexicans say.

515
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,591
I'll be back in a moment

516
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,888
Mm-hmm.

517
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,167
All right.

518
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,703
She looks well.

519
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:53,575
- Doesn't she, huh?
- Yes. She does.

520
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,577
Mmm. Looks well.

521
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,579
I think-

522
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:03,051
I think I will only drink beer
today on our outing.

523
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,678
Chin. Chin.

524
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,519
There's nothing like...

525
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,525
beer-

526
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,027
beer to straighten one out.

527
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,825
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,831
- And then -
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

529
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:21,495
Then go back to the strychnine.

530
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,774
Strychnine. Who knows?

531
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,436
Uh-huh.

532
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,843
Who knows?
I may actually-

533
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,976
I may get off it completely.

534
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:38,714
- Well, you ought to try.
- Yes.

535
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,985
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- All right?

536
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,992
Yes, yes, yes.

537
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,033
Look, Geoff, shouldn't I -

538
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,399
Shouldn't I leave?

539
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,472
- Leave?
- Yes.

540
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,564
Immediately,
rather than hang around.

541
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,041
Whatever for?

542
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,079
Well, I thought
it might make things easier.

543
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,979
M-Make what eas-easier?

544
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,920
For the two of you. Here.

545
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,456
- For the two of us?
- Yes.

546
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,289
I mean, now that Yvonne's back,
you'll be very well looked after.

547
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,524
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

548
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:28,598
Yvonne's wiles
or your own baser instincts?

549
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,071
For Christ's sake,
should I go or not?

550
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,507
Wouldn't it look rather odd,
you just shooting off?

551
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,443
Stay, Hugh.

552
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,849
Hmm. Of course. You must stay.

553
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,300
Ready.

554
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,734
You look very... very.

555
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,831
Thank you.

556
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,007
Mmm. Here.

557
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:43,177
No se puede vivir sin amar

558
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,271
What?

559
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,714
"One cannot live without love."

560
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:55,881
It really is an extraordinarily nice day
for a trip.

561
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,621
We should, uh, carry on to Tomalin
after the fiesta.

562
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,924
No car.

563
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,059
Where's your sense of adventure?
We can take the bus.

564
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:10,196
Get there in time for the charreada
ˇOlé! and all that.

565
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,606
- Are we up to that?
- "Up to that?"

566
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,610
"Up to that?" What a question.

567
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,723
Oh, they look so serene.

568
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,952
Our ever-present guardian angels

569
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,520
Popocatepetl and his sleeping lady

570
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:37,532
- We should pay them a visit.
- That's the spirit.

571
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,728
After the bulls,
we'll pop up old Popo...

572
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,305
and look into the hot heart
of the volcano.

573
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,636
One step at a time, old man.

574
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:51,080
Doctor Vigil!

575
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,548
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días

576
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,586
I am glad, after last night,
you are among the living.

577
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,990
- Buenos días, doctor
- Buenos días

578
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,265
Hello, Doctor.

579
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,801
Nice to see you again.

580
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:17,304
- Since when you are here?
- I came this morning.

581
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,307
Miraculous.

582
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,776
Truly it is a miracle.

583
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,373
In the night, we pray to the Virgin
for those who have nobody them with.

584
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,317
The consul and me,
we pray for your return...

585
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,014
and now you are here.

586
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,091
Is it not wonderful?

587
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,689
Geoffrey? Did you?

588
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,766
I might point out, amigo,
Yvonne left New York over a week ago.

589
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,301
It seems your miracle is after the fact.

590
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:51,602
Ah, but the Virgin, she knew you were
going to pray before ever you prayed.

591
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,676
Is still more miracle.

592
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:58,009
The good doctor makes logic and faith
lie down together like the lion and the lamb.

593
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,981
Doctor, what would you prescribe
for a chronic case...

594
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,576
of uncontrollable, all-possessing
and inescapable delirium tremens?

595
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,020
More alcohol is best,
in a quantity moderated.

596
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,854
- Precisely. You hear that, you two?
- Uh, I heard "moderated."

597
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,987
Doctor, would you care to join me
in a little moderation?

598
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,966
I cannot. I must see to a child coming.

599
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,663
So I leave the family to be together.

600
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,866
Seńora Firmin, truly you are a miracle.

601
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,875
Thank you, Doctor.

602
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,674
Buenos días
It's a lovely day.

603
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,749
We shall have thunder.

604
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,752
- Adiós.
- Adiós

605
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:55,607
- Did you?
- What?

606
00:57:55,717 --> 00:57:57,742
Go to the shrine.

607
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,253
I'm sure I couldn't tell you honestly.

608
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:03,552
Uh, the events of last night
are somewhat, uh, dim.

609
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:07,761
Ah.

610
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:14,296
"Plingen, plangen, auf gefangen...

611
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:18,066
swingen, swangen at my s-side."

612
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:22,269
Uh - "Swootle, pootle...

613
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:24,277
"off to Bootle.

614
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,313
Nemesis: a pleasant ride!"

615
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:28,645
I arrived in heaven!

616
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:20,563
Dońa Inés

617
00:59:20,669 --> 00:59:24,002
ˇDońa Inés! ˇDońa Inés!

618
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,672
That's the way to contend
with the grim reaper.

619
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:05,177
Offer him a drink and a dance!

620
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,847
Will you two talk to me
after I've gone?

621
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:17,323
Offer me bread and sugar skulls to help me
on my journey into the next world?

622
01:00:17,425 --> 01:00:20,326
Oh, absolutely, old man.
Once a year.

623
01:00:21,596 --> 01:00:24,360
You should write something
about the Day of the Dead.

624
01:00:24,466 --> 01:00:26,366
- It's been done.
- Oh.

625
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:30,063
Give it a -
Give it a Marxist interpretation.

626
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:33,800
Matter of fact, I've about decided
to trade in the old typewriter...

627
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:36,605
for a musket.

628
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:38,611
I might -

629
01:00:38,713 --> 01:00:42,114
I just might go back to England,
enlist in the R.A.F.

630
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:45,353
This next war will be fought in the air.

631
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:48,388
The next war?
Just the same old one.

632
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,390
Oh, no, no, Geoff.

633
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:54,326
This time, it won't be for territories
or possessions, but for our very souls.

634
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:57,125
Our souls? Ah, good.

635
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:59,860
So we still have them, do we?
I thought, uh -

636
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:03,699
But no, I mustn't judge others
as I judge myself.

637
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:06,069
You have a soul, Geoff.
You have a great soul.

638
01:01:06,174 --> 01:01:10,304
I must have mislaid it then.
Perhaps you'll help me to find it, my dear.

639
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,482
- Well, shall we brave the rides?
- The infernal machine?

640
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,314
Not me You two go on I'll catch up

641
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,287
- Shall we go back?
- No, no. Go on. Enjoy yourselves.

642
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:24,790
I'll fortify myself for the bus ride.
Hair of the dog, you know.

643
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:27,953
Go on. I'll - I'll, uh, catch up.

644
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:33,401
I think perhaps you've
come back just in time.

645
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,935
I would've come back sooner.

646
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:37,937
Why didn't you?

647
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:42,408
Well, I wasn't sure he wanted me to.
He never answered my letters.

648
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,478
I don't think he ever read them.

649
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:47,480
- What?
- Your letters.

650
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:50,449
He carries them around
stuffed inside his shirt...

651
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:52,611
but I don't think he ever opened them.

652
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:57,917
I cannot find them at all.

653
01:01:58,026 --> 01:02:00,392
Think of places you can go.

654
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:04,693
Think in your mind the cantinas
where you go all the time.

655
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,666
- Think.
- Bustamante's.

656
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,670
Hmm. Sí El Sol de la Noche.

657
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:12,672
They're not there.

658
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:16,266
El Popo? No. El Petate? No.

659
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:20,440
Uh, Todos Contentos y Yo También?

660
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:22,675
No.

661
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:25,617
- El Farolito.
- [Laughs] No.

662
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,746
Seńor Cónsul, you never been there.

663
01:02:28,857 --> 01:02:32,623
- Yes, once.
- Oh, you makin' a joke on me.

664
01:02:32,727 --> 01:02:35,355
Gentlemens never go to El Farolito.

665
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:38,455
Es horrible Es muy malo

666
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:41,467
Men balls turn blue...

667
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:44,538
and then they go sick,
and then they go crazy and they die.

668
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,370
Ha! If anybody be there,
I break the glass here.

669
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:53,438
Believe me, dońa Gregoria,
I am as chaste as a new-frocked priest.

670
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:57,251
There's no need to break my glass.

671
01:02:57,352 --> 01:02:59,820
Only fill it again on your own,
dońa Gregoria.

672
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:02,617
Ay, seńor Cónsul Hmm.

673
01:03:02,724 --> 01:03:05,022
After a while, I began to wonder.

674
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,426
If a man can hold his liquor as well as Geoff,
why shouldn't he drink?

675
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:12,022
Somehow, Hugh,
that is not very consoling.

676
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:15,364
I'm simply at a loss
as to how to help him.

677
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,871
Perhaps we should get away from here,
away from Cuernavaca.

678
01:03:19,908 --> 01:03:23,435
- Find a farm somewhere.
- A farm?

679
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:27,845
A real farm, with a red barn and silos
and pigs and chickens.

680
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:30,417
What, no guinea fowl?
No peacocks?

681
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:36,019
- Is it so fantastic?
- Perhaps not.

682
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:38,285
We have money. Enough.

683
01:03:38,393 --> 01:03:41,851
I'm sorry.

684
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:44,090
It's just the notion of Geoff
among the alfalfa...

685
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,498
in bib overalls and a straw hat,
soberly hoeing.

686
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:51,129
Well, it wouldn't have to be
as soberly as all that.

687
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,207
What if he hates farms?

688
01:03:53,308 --> 01:03:56,175
Maybe the mere sight of a cow
makes him seasick.

689
01:03:56,277 --> 01:04:00,373
Well, maybe it's ridiculous, but at least
it's better than sitting here doing nothing.

690
01:04:02,484 --> 01:04:05,009
No. Gracias No. No.

691
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,588
No!

692
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:12,757
- No, gracias
- Let me pass.

693
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:14,988
- No, gracias
- No, gracias

694
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:20,433
Here's to your love.

695
01:04:21,736 --> 01:04:24,170
- Well -
- I hope that she come back to you soon.

696
01:04:24,272 --> 01:04:26,604
In fact, she has.

697
01:04:28,843 --> 01:04:31,607
So it is. One day,
maybe she come back to you.

698
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:34,841
She has.
This morning, on the bus.

699
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:38,350
Seńor Cónsul, if you had esposa...

700
01:04:38,453 --> 01:04:41,047
you would lose everything
in that love.

701
01:04:41,156 --> 01:04:43,124
Oh.

702
01:04:44,526 --> 01:04:47,393
Because is beautiful to have love

703
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:51,557
But your mind is "occupated"
on one thing

704
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:55,568
So you will never lose your mind

705
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:05,806
I hope your wife come back soon

706
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:10,010
She's there, right now. Out there.

707
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:14,820
You can ever think of it.

708
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:17,687
Ay, seńor Cónsul
żNo quiere otra?

709
01:05:18,726 --> 01:05:22,218
- No, a bottle of Habanero, por favor
- Ay

710
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,298
Cómo no, seńor Cónsul

711
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:26,299
Ahora se la traigo

712
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,307
Ah, you know, seńor Cónsul

713
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:39,470
I think you going to see
your esposa very soon.

714
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:43,075
I can see you together...

715
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:46,381
laughing in a very nice place.

716
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:49,684
In the place you used to laugh.

717
01:05:49,791 --> 01:05:51,691
Huh?

718
01:05:53,294 --> 01:05:55,524
Ay, gracias, seńor Cónsul

719
01:05:59,234 --> 01:06:03,170
- Adiós
- Adiós, dońa Gregoria

720
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:18,951

721
01:06:21,522 --> 01:06:24,457
Whoa!

722
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:02,419
Here we go.

723
01:07:11,472 --> 01:07:13,997
Whoa!

724
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,882
Ride 'em, cowboy!

725
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:33,521
Go on, my beauty!

726
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:35,493
For your life!

727
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,772
M-My heels kicked at heaven!

728
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:58,113
Oh! ˇGracias!

Gracias Gracias
Gracias Gracias

733
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:14,093
- Let's forget the charreada, Geoff.
- Absolutely not.

734
01:08:14,202 --> 01:08:16,830
Forward to the arena!

735
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,719
It's like riding over the moon.

736
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:50,198
I thought divorcées didn't wear
their wedding rings.

737
01:08:50,304 --> 01:08:52,738
- They don't.
- Well then?

738
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:55,909
I couldn't get the ring off.

739
01:08:58,613 --> 01:09:02,674
He's a bloody sinarquista
Look at that badge on his lapel.

740
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:05,548
They're the ones
I've been writing about.

741
01:09:05,653 --> 01:09:07,814
The ones getting money
from the Nazis.

742
01:09:28,276 --> 01:09:31,040
Stop Stop the bus Alto.

743
01:09:44,692 --> 01:09:46,785
- Prohibido
- The hell it is.

744
01:09:54,268 --> 01:09:56,168
Good Christ.

745
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,261
Geoffrey, it's the flute player.

746
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:00,397
- A doctor in Tomalin?
- Sí

747
01:10:00,508 --> 01:10:03,341
- Go on, Geoff. Let's get him on the bus.
- Stop. Prohibido Don't touch.

748
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:07,005
No, seńor. We go to jail.
No mi camión

749
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:09,606
It is the law
You will be made accomplices

750
01:10:09,717 --> 01:10:11,810
Let it go, Hugh.
Here come the local authorities.

751
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:16,481
Well, we have to help him.

752
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,491
It's too late.

753
01:10:21,462 --> 01:10:23,362
What you doing?

754
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:30,668
- You murder?
- No, of course not.

755
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:33,399
- You know who murder?
- No!

756
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:35,942
He's dead, Hugh. Let it go.

757
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:46,445
ˇVámonos!

758
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,568
He was thrown from the horse.

759
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:05,401
Come from the market.
Mucho dinero

760
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:12,638
Could've gotten yourself shot

761
01:12:02,096 --> 01:12:03,996
ˇOlé!

762
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,000

Buenas tardes

765
01:12:34,428 --> 01:12:36,658
Perhaps you'd like to start
little "hin fish."

766
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:39,562
- "Hin fish?"
- Nice "hin fish"

767
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:42,192
Gin fizz.

- Tequila doble, por favor

772
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:54,212
You like eggs, seńora?

773
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:57,682
Stepped-on eggs? Divorced eggs?
Poxy eggs on toast?

774
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:01,287
Uh, no "poxy" eggs for me.

775
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:04,381
What's this?
"Spectral chicken of the house"?

776
01:13:04,492 --> 01:13:07,017
- Pollo de la casa.
- Ah.

777
01:13:07,128 --> 01:13:10,529
- Shall we try the spectral chicken?
- Uh, sounds heavenly.

778
01:13:10,631 --> 01:13:13,293
Pollo para todos, por favor

01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:14,357
# Madrid, you wondrous city #

789
01:14:14,462 --> 01:14:16,828
#Mamita mía #

790
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:19,593
#We wanted to take you #

791
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:23,261
#They wanted #

792
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:26,306
#To take you #

793
01:14:30,544 --> 01:14:33,536
# But your courageous children #

794
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:38,016
#But your courageous children #

795
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:42,385
#But your courageous children #

796
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:46,927
# Mamita mía
Did not disgrace you #

797
01:14:47,027 --> 01:14:51,123
# Did not #

798
01:14:51,232 --> 01:14:53,700
# Disgrace you #

799
01:14:57,972 --> 01:15:01,499
#And all your tears of sorrow #

800
01:15:01,609 --> 01:15:05,602
- #And all your tears of sorrow #
- ##[Harmonizing Continues]

801
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:09,911
#And all your tears of sorrow #

802
01:15:10,017 --> 01:15:15,148
# Mamita mía
We shall avenge them #

803
01:15:15,256 --> 01:15:19,454
#We shall #

804
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,758
#Avenge them ##

805
01:15:27,968 --> 01:15:32,871
- Gracias, seńor.
- Good. Very good.

806
01:15:32,973 --> 01:15:34,873
Gracias, seńor

807
01:15:41,015 --> 01:15:43,813
Had an English friend fighting in Spain.

808
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:46,512
He was there from the start

809
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,781
During the Battle of Madrid

810
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:52,450
he lay holed up with a machine gun
in the library of University City

811
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,994
reading Carlyle between attacks.

812
01:15:57,398 --> 01:15:59,866
He was a Communist.

813
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:02,265
Approximately the best man I ever met.

814
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:07,766
Had a taste for Vin Rosé d'Anjou

815
01:16:08,943 --> 01:16:10,843
and a dog named Harpo.

816
01:16:12,146 --> 01:16:15,445
You wouldn't expect a Communist
to have a dog named Harpo

817
01:16:15,549 --> 01:16:17,915
Or would one?

818
01:16:18,018 --> 01:16:20,748
He'd been reported dead
twice before

819
01:16:20,855 --> 01:16:23,323
and both times
he showed up again at the front.

820
01:16:24,425 --> 01:16:26,916
So when he was listed
as a casualty the third time...

821
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:29,791
no one took any notice

822
01:16:29,897 --> 01:16:31,865
expecting him
to turn up again any day

823
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:33,934
hale as ever.

824
01:16:36,403 --> 01:16:38,769
He didn't.

825
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:43,844
Cervantes! ˇOtros tequila, por favor!

826
01:16:43,944 --> 01:16:45,844
A bottle!

827
01:16:47,948 --> 01:16:50,678
When I think of the men I knew there -

828
01:16:50,784 --> 01:16:53,014
the ones who stayed and died -

829
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:56,180
Christ, I feel like a deserter.

830
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:58,224
I should never have left.

831
01:16:58,325 --> 01:17:00,793
You said yourself it was a lost cause.

832
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:03,557
My conscience says that's no excuse.

833
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:06,963
What do you know
about conscience and about guilt?

834
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:09,592
Remember who you're talking to

835
01:17:09,703 --> 01:17:11,671
Master of the S. S. Samaritan

836
01:17:11,772 --> 01:17:14,969
whose hands - these very hands -
los manos to Firmin -

837
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:18,533
flung seven German officers
into her fiery furnace

838
01:17:18,646 --> 01:17:22,480
- You did not.
- One after the other, kicking and squealing.

839
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:25,347
The tale gets taller
each time he tells it.

840
01:17:25,452 --> 01:17:27,579
Geoffrey, you know very well you didn't.

841
01:17:27,688 --> 01:17:29,952
The British Navy doesn't
give medals to murderers.

842
01:17:30,991 --> 01:17:33,255
Well, I might have done it.

843
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,158
I was the commanding officer responsible.

844
01:17:37,197 --> 01:17:39,290
You can't apologize for some things.

845
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,391
The past fills up quicker than we know.

846
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:45,302
"Firmin innocent.
Bears guilt of world on shoulders."

847
01:17:47,441 --> 01:17:50,774
Bears your guilt as well, doesn't he?

848
01:17:52,846 --> 01:17:54,746
He invited

849
01:17:54,848 --> 01:17:57,339
the heart full of dust

850
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:59,351
that he got.

851
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:01,353
Cervantes! Tequila!

852
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:04,983
ˇOlé!

853
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:11,485
He's quite good actually.
I say, well done!

854
01:19:13,193 --> 01:19:15,718
ˇOlé!

855
01:19:15,829 --> 01:19:17,729
ˇOlé!

856
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,862
ˇOlé! ˇOlé!

857
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,438
It was always one of his dreams -
to be a matador.

858
01:19:25,539 --> 01:19:29,100
He practices veronicas
in front of a mirror.

859
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:34,871
ˇOlé!

860
01:19:36,216 --> 01:19:38,116
ˇOlé!

861
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,594
ˇOlé!

862
01:19:50,497 --> 01:19:52,431
ˇOlé!

863
01:19:57,705 --> 01:20:00,572
ˇOlé! Bravo, Hugh!

864
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,544
ˇToreador! i: Toreador! i: Toreador! i: Toreador!

865
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:16,919
ˇToreador! ˇToreador!
ˇToreador! ˇToreador!

866
01:20:17,024 --> 01:20:19,584
ˇToreador! i: Toreador!

867
01:20:19,693 --> 01:20:22,355
ˇToreador! i: Toreador!

868
01:20:22,463 --> 01:20:24,863
ˇToreador! i: Toreador!

869
01:20:24,965 --> 01:20:28,662
ˇToreador! i: Toreador! i: Toreador!

870
01:20:42,182 --> 01:20:45,083
- Geoffrey, listen. Look at me.
- What?

871
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:48,621
- There's nothing holding us here any longer.
- No, there's nothing holding us.

872
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:51,987
- Let's go away together.
- No.

873
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:54,060
It's not too late.

874
01:20:54,161 --> 01:20:56,789
- We can -We can start again.
- Start again?

875
01:20:56,897 --> 01:21:00,128
Yes, in another place.
A new place will give us a better chance.

876
01:21:00,234 --> 01:21:04,102
Why not?
Why not, for sweetJesus' sake? Let's go.

877
01:21:04,204 --> 01:21:06,764
Oh, I love you.
I want our marriage back.

878
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:09,468
So do I. So do I.

879
01:21:09,576 --> 01:21:12,374
- I've fallen down somewhat.
- Never mind.

880
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:15,505
- We could go north, to Maine or Canada.
- Yes! Yes. Anywhere.

881
01:21:15,616 --> 01:21:17,982
Find a cabin slap-bang on the sea.

882
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:21,919
Cliffs beaten by the surf.
Um, a small pier in a cove.

883
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:24,820
- We could. We really could.
We could live on very little.
- Yes. We could.

884
01:21:24,925 --> 01:21:26,893
Draw our own water.
Chop our own wood.

885
01:21:26,994 --> 01:21:29,519
- After all, I'm still as strong as a horse
- Yes

886
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,030
- What's all this?
- We're leaving.

887
01:21:32,132 --> 01:21:35,932
Headed north, where there's snow
and the year's divided into seasons.

888
01:21:36,036 --> 01:21:38,129
A farm with a red barn?

889
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:40,138
No, no.

890
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:44,677
Escape into the wilderness
like good old William Blackstone.

891
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:48,305
Get to know the trappers
and the fishermen -

892
01:21:48,415 --> 01:21:50,679
the last free men on Earth.

893
01:21:50,784 --> 01:21:53,981
Nothing but tall pines.
No phones, no electricity.

894
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:57,079
Quite a life. Tranquil isolation.

895
01:21:57,191 --> 01:21:59,557
Quite.

896
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,788
Stuck between the forest and the sea...

897
01:22:02,896 --> 01:22:05,865
where there's all the time there is.

898
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:07,934
Yvonne'll make pottery.

899
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:10,367
I'll write my memoirs

900
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:14,903
Go further north each winter.

901
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:18,774
Strike for the Pole.
Wear bearskins. Chew seal blubber.

902
01:22:20,013 --> 01:22:22,277
Build igloos
Live among the Eskimo

903
01:22:22,382 --> 01:22:26,512
Uh, uh, when-
when Brother Hugh comes on a visit

904
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,714
fresh from his heroics
in, uh, Spain or wherever

905
01:22:29,823 --> 01:22:32,758
I'll show proper Eskimo hospitality
and give him my wife...

906
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:36,694
to bed down with
during the cold northern night.

907
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:41,399
Geoff, what possesses you?

908
01:22:45,839 --> 01:22:47,864
Sobriety, I'm afraid.

909
01:22:47,975 --> 01:22:49,943
Too much moderation.

910
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,107
I need drink desperately.
Get my balance back.

911
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:11,030
What an uncommon time
they must have had of it...

912
01:23:12,866 --> 01:23:14,891
paddling palms,
playing bubbies and titties...

913
01:23:15,002 --> 01:23:17,493
while I was having bouts
with rats and roaches.

914
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:23,900
"It isn't too late,"she said

915
01:23:24,011 --> 01:23:27,310
Why isn't it too late?
Why isn't it? Did I say so? No.

916
01:23:27,414 --> 01:23:30,941
No, I thought it was -
it was all legally settled.

917
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:34,851
It's only she that insists
it isn't too late...

918
01:23:34,955 --> 01:23:39,756
because she can't get
the bloody ring off.

919
01:23:41,028 --> 01:23:43,929
Geoffrey. Geoffrey, I've come...

920
01:23:46,033 --> 01:23:48,160
cr- crawling back.

921
01:23:51,004 --> 01:23:53,768
What m-more can I do?

922
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:57,833
Let me be your wife.

923
01:23:57,945 --> 01:24:01,346
When has she ever been a wife to me?

924
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:03,712
Where are the children
I might have had...

925
01:24:03,817 --> 01:24:05,682
that drowned to the rattling-

926
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:08,846
of a thousand douche bags?

927
01:24:10,057 --> 01:24:13,959
Hugh, on the threshold of paradise

928
01:24:14,061 --> 01:24:18,691
puffing over her gills like a codfish,
veins like a racehorse...

929
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:23,236
prime as a goat, hot as a monkey,
salt as a wolf in pride.

930
01:24:23,337 --> 01:24:28,365
Let them wallow here in their bliss
with my blessing

931
01:24:30,143 --> 01:24:32,373
Hell's...

932
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:34,947
my preference.

933
01:24:36,783 --> 01:24:39,377
I choose hell.

934
01:24:41,488 --> 01:24:47,222
Hell is my natural habitat.

935
01:25:04,277 --> 01:25:06,404
Let him go, Yvonne.

936
01:25:06,513 --> 01:25:09,676
- There's nothing one can do when he's like this.
- Something will happen to him.

937
01:25:09,783 --> 01:25:12,547
He'll drink himself sober
and come dragging home in the morning.

938
01:25:12,652 --> 01:25:15,314
- Hugh, we were wrong, not Geoffrey.
- And we'll never make up for it.

939
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:18,414
He won't let us.
He doesn't want your help.

940
01:25:18,525 --> 01:25:20,789
I want his.

941
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,607
ˇHola! Bus!

942
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:42,213
Geoffrey!

943
01:26:42,476 --> 01:26:44,671
Mezcal

944
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:56,748
Mezcal, por favor

945
01:27:01,895 --> 01:27:03,863
Ay, el inglés

946

01:39:22,068 --> 01:39:25,401
That's my religion

1044
01:39:25,504 --> 01:39:27,870
Mozart was a lawyer.
Stick by that, you'll be all right.

Looking at your horse. Admiring.

1071
01:41:50,249 --> 01:41:54,948
For why you look at mi caballo?
Huh? For why?
