1
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,792
Watch it!

2
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,931
Just like the one that got away

3
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:41,309
So close, but yet so far

4
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:42,810
UP THE CREEK

5
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,313
I threw my hook into the water

6
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,315
I nearly caught her

7
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,400
How bizarre

8
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,153
Now I'm up the creek

9
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:54,072
Though I have lost a little pride

10
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,782
I'm up the creek

11
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,575
I know that time is on my side

12
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,535
I'm up the creek

13
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,412
Though you have pulled the plug on me

14
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,289
I'm up the creek

15
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,249
There's more than one fish in the sea

16
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,085
I'm not about to let it be

17
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,504
I know that I am up the creek

18
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:12,382
Hey! Hey!

19
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,764
The foreign legion's always there

20
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,600
I need a holiday

21
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,479
Daydream in the desert

22
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:28,314
With no pressure

23
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:33,069
That's the way
'cause I'm up the creek

24
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,904
Oh, I've lost a little pride

25
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:36,823
I'm up the creek

26
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:38,741
I know that time is on my side

27
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,535
I'm up the creek

28
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,245
Though you have pulled the plug on me

29
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,288
I'm up the creek

30
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,165
There's more than one fish in the sea

31
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not about to let it be

32
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,420
I know that I am up the creek

33
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,049
I'm up the creek

34
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,926
Without a paddle

35
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,761
I'm up the creek

36
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,139
But that don't matter at all

37
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,309
Don't matter at all

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,897
I'm up the creek

39
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,733
Without a paddle

40
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:13,359
I'm up the creek

41
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:16,612
But it don't matter at all

42
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,575
Don't matter at all

43
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh!

44
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,165
Hey! Hey!

45
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:39,010
LEPETOMANE UNIVERSITY
LAST CAMPUS

46
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:59,030
LEPETOMANE
SECURITY

47
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,550
Excuse me, could you...

48
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,222
What a big nightstick!

49
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,954
Mom? No! Take me!

50
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,748
It wasn't Mr. Moo-moo.
Don't wake Mr. Moo-moo!

51
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:51,958
No!

52
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:08,724
Okay, okay.
How about lunch?

53
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:09,892
Gotta get lunch, right?

54
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,435
Max, it's five in the morning!

55
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,855
What about dinner?
You gotta get hungry sometime today...

56
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:14,981
Hello?

57
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,068
Desperation's not pretty.

58
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:46,971
Cheese!

59
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,824
Hey!

60
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,754
See Jose run.

61
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:23,925
Run, Jose, run!

62
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:30,598
Jose has no green card.

63
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,071
It was open!

64
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,281
Get out of bed, McGraw,
we haven't got all day.

65
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,408
The 200's out then, huh?

66
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,035
I've seen your record, McGraw.

67
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,828
I know what kind of a guy you are,

68
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:54,455
so don't give me
an excuse to use this.

69
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,233
Your mother's ugly.
You're stupid.

70
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,934
- Your sister makes it with...
- You stinking...

71
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,962
Stop it, Leslie.
Get ahold of yourself!

72
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,588
Don't let this jerk get to you.

73
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,966
Come on, I'm sorry.

74
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:06,968
Let's just forget
I said anything, okay?

75
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,261
Let's be pals.

76
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,847
What do you say, Leslie?

77
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,099
Leslie!

78
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,850
Come on,
let me hit him just once.

79
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,603
Just one little crack on the head,
that's all I'm asking.

80
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,564
All right. Just a little one.
But make it fast.

81
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,858
Hey, don't you guys
have a sense of humor?

82
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,702
Get rid of the bottle, McGraw.

83
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,413
Oh, Leslie.
For you, anything.

84
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,875
Come on. Come on.

85
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,017
Hey!

86
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,477
Dean Burch.

87
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:03,232
You've had quite a colorful
career as a student, Mr. McGraw.

88
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,986
You've managed to be suspended,
expelled, or physically thrown out of

89
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,822
16 colleges and universities
throughout the country.

90
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:14,243
You've changed your major 23 times.

91
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:17,079
And your presence has been tied directly

92
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:20,416
to three university presidents
losing their jobs,

93
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,502
two others being
committed to sanitariums,

94
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:26,005
and at least one known suicide.

95
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,883
Have I left anything out?

96
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,634
Just the good stuff.

97
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,724
Mr. McGraw, as you are aware,

98
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:40,019
this university, our university

99
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:44,273
has the reputation as the single worst
educational institution in the country.

100
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,150
That's because it is the worst

101
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,402
educational institution
in the country, sir.

102
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:52,364
Do you realize
that not one single student,

103
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:55,076
including you, and them,

104
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,829
has ever won any award
for anything?

105
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,124
Not one ribbon, not one trophy.

106
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,752
In fact,
the only certifiable recognition

107
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:07,338
that any of our alumni
have ever received

108
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,923
is a parole.

109
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:16,347
Mr. McGraw,
every year for the past 15 years

110
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,474
the colleges and
universities of this country

111
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:21,769
have held an
intercollegiate raft race.

112
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:26,524
If just once we...

113
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,943
I mean you

114
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,862
could win this race for our school,

115
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,781
it would mean an end

116
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:36,117
to jokes like "Lobotomy U."

117
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,875
it would mean that
for the first time in our history...

118
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:49,672
Let me clarify my position,
so that you can understand.

119
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,591
A raft means a river,

120
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:55,594
and a river means rapids,

121
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,472
and rapids spells death.

122
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,182
You got the wrong guy!

123
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,434
Not so fast, McGraw!

124
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:04,436
Okay.

125
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,982
You've got the wrong guy.

126
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,317
Excuse me, Dean Burch.

127
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,362
Um, I think there's another point
that should be made.

128
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:15,072
I don't need this aggravation,

129
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,199
and this really
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

130
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:18,951
I'm damned if I'll let my university

131
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,453
be the laughing stock
of this country any longer!

132
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:24,373
I want a victory with a capital "V"
and I want it now!

133
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:27,209
No more excuses!
No more holding back!

134
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,004
That's why I picked you.
And them!

135
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,214
You have the distinct honor of being

136
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:34,925
the four worst students
in the entire country.

137
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,678
You are not
at the bottom of the list,

138
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,889
you are the bottom of the list!

139
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:43,684
That's why you're going to
win this race for me and Lepetomane.

140
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,520
You're the only men
who virtually have nothing left to lose!

141
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,772
Except my temper.

142
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:50,900
Mr. McGraw,

143
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,694
I'm not asking you
to do this for nothing.

144
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:57,615
In fact, I'm prepared to
make a very generous offer.

145
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,201
Degrees.

146
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,620
For all of you.

147
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,164
Degrees?

148
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,374
In whatever subject you like.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,251
English lit?

150
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,961
If that's what you want.

151
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,464
Providing, of course, that you win.

152
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,882
Physics?

153
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,509
Biochemistry.
With a minor in art history.

154
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,220
Home Ec?

155
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,645
And what if I say no?

156
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,482
I was hoping
we could avoid this scene,

157
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,526
but since you feel
the need to test me...

158
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,029
I suppose you know nothing
about the student loans

159
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:40,282
you've taken out
in 35 different names.

160
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:44,161
Or last semester's bookmaking
operation in the computer center.

161
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,831
You think you can blackmail me

162
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:51,085
into playing this
little game of yours, don't you?

163
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,504
Well, I got news for you, Mister.

164
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,840
This aingt just any dumb schmo
you're dealing with here,

165
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,470
this is Bob McGraw.
The Bob McGraw.

166
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:04,932
And it's gonna take men
a lot bigger than you

167
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,851
to make this guy play ball.

168
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,824
How about Poli-Sci?

169
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:26,787
I don't believe it!

170
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,039
Bob, listen to this.
She dumped me!

171
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,666
Aw, come on, Max.

172
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,252
Bob, she said she never
wants to see me again.

173
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:35,879
Let me tell you something about women.

174
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,632
They always say
the opposite of what they mean.

175
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,467
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,720
"If you come within
a three block radius of my house,

177
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,097
"I will have my new boyfriend Vito

178
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,891
"rip off your head
and spit in your neck."

179
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,728
You're right, kid.
You've been dumped.

180
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,813
Forget about her.
Have a drink, huh?

181
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,482
The bar is now open.
Cocktails, anyone?

182
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,319
- Banana daiquiri.
- Martini, straight up.

183
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,113
Okay. Here you go,
extra dry, just the way you like it.

184
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:02,531
Thank you.

185
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,075
How about you, big guy?

186
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,368
I'm all set.

187
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,874
Gonzer, do you realize
what you're doing to your body?

188
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,709
That stuff's gonna kill you!

189
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,128
Maybe not today
and maybe not tomorrow,

190
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,255
but soon,
and for the rest of your life.

191
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,757
Gonz, your body is your temple.

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,134
If you don't worship it,
who will?

193
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,636
And, Gonz, your temple
is starting to resemble the astrodome.

194
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,641
Hey, Max is right.
Get rid of that shit.

195
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,977
Come on, Gonzer,
show food who's boss.

196
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,187
Throw it out the window.

197
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,106
Gonzer! Gonzer!

198
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,777
Gonzer! Gonzer! Gonzer!

199
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,660
- That's the way to go!
- All right, Gonz!

200
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,412
What would you like to drink?

201
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,123
- Let me have a Brandy Alexander.
- Brandy Alexander.

202
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:55,626
There you go.
Especially for you.

203
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,878
Gonz, you look thinner already.

204
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,964
Excuse me. Excuse me.

205
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:07,429
Uh, look, Bob,
I know we're not exactly the best.

206
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,307
As a matter of fact,
we're not even very good.

207
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,267
But, uh, do you think
we have a chance?

208
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,770
Everybody's got a chance, kid.

209
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:16,688
This is America.

210
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,816
Let's take you, for example.

211
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,068
Skinny, uncoordinated,

212
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:23,695
got a yellow streak
down your back a mile wide,

213
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:27,032
you're anemic,
you dress like a creep,

214
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,952
you've got the personality
of a mayo and baloney on white.

215
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,081
You're the kind of guy most people
wouldn't give the time of day to.

216
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,083
What does that mean?

217
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,376
I don't know.

218
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,627
- That doesn't mean...
- Bob!

219
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,795
...you don't have a chance.

220
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:40,921
Look at me!

221
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,885
Gee, I never thought of it like that.

222
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,012
Hey, don't mention it, kid.

223
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,979
Oh, geez!

224
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:58,480
Gonzer!

225
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,234
Oh, man!

226
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,194
Gonzer!

227
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,905
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

228
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:09,032
It wasn't me, man.

229
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,368
Who was it?

230
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:13,412
- It wasn't!
- Who was it?

231
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:14,997
It was Chuck!

232
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,972
Ivy U! Ivy U!

233
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:45,986
Roland Tozer.

234
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:47,696
- Rex Crandall.
- Rex.

235
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,448
- Roger Van Dyke.
- Roger.

236
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,368
Men, I have a lot of race preparation
to do before tomorrow morning.

237
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:57,164
What do you say we just cut the bullshit
and get down to business?

238
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,001
Standard race equipment.

239
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:04,671
Regulation handle,
stock and blade.

240
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,040
With the exception of
a little added feature.

241
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,844
Which is quite effective
when it comes to

242
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:13,972
slashing the tubes of rafts
without dropping a stroke.

243
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,433
-Impressive.
- Adequate.

244
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,644
You haven't seen anything yet.

245
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,104
The Ivy U race kit.

246
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,106
Baby!

247
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,527
These ought to take care
of any front runners.

248
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,945
Explosives!

249
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,072
Is this it?

250
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:33,242
Not to worry.
There's plenty more back at my house.

251
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:35,994
What you cannot destroy or disable,

252
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,539
I will have my referees disqualify.

253
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,041
Good. Very good.

254
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,462
Here it is. $5,000 in hundreds,
just like you requested.

255
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,422
Well, thanks.

256
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,508
Would you like the trophy now,

257
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:52,135
or do you want to wait until
you actually cross the finish line?

258
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,304
What,
and disappoint the crowd?

259
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,808
I can't wait to be
standing on my deck

260
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,978
watching you come
around that bend. Thanks.

261
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,313
Aren't you gonna count it?

262
00:16:04,523 --> 00:16:08,151
What, distrust of an alumnus?
Class of '63.

263
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:12,406
I'll see you in the winner's circle.

264
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:14,199
Thank you, sir.

265
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,204
HINEWILLE
GAS - FOOD - BEER - FISHING TACKLE

266
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:40,350
I need a shave. Bath.
Cup of coffee and a good woman.

267
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:44,021
Something told me
we've come to the wrong place.

268
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,147
Fill it up, Gonz.

269
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:51,570
You got any money?

270
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:59,536
What the hell's this?

271
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,209
Will you check the oil?

272
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,670
Yes, sir.
Just as soon as I'm done here.

273
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:10,839
What the heck,
I'll do that for you.

274
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:13,175
No use you standing there
holding your hose.

275
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,511
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

276
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,222
Sure. That's it there.

277
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,517
- Hiya.
- Hi, how are ya?

278
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:23,727
Not bad. Yourself?

279
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,145
- Okay.
- Good.

280
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,606
Lots of grit.

281
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,025
Yeah, they get
that way, I guess.

282
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,114
Looks good.

283
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:37,824
Looks great to me.

284
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,331
Wait. Wait.
Maybe you better check the battery.

285
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:45,957
It's in here somewhere.
I'm not sure where it is.

286
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,209
It's over here.

287
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,087
- Oh, that's a big one.
- Yeah, they gotta be.

288
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:51,505
Get up!

289
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:53,465
You give me a hard on!

290
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:54,591
Get up!

291
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,968
Party!

292
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,721
Ivy U! Ivy U!

293
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,124
Listen to this part, you guys.

294
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,293
"His strong hands
ran over her hardened nipples.

295
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,838
"The tender touch
of his glistening body

296
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:35,966
"sent shock waves
running through her naked breasts."

297
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,719
I believe I've read
this book before, Molly.

298
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,637
You know, I think I read it, too.

299
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,097
I think it's in the next chapter

300
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,975
where they start talking about
his "throbbing spaceship of love."

301
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,061
Is that what Rexy-poo calls it?

302
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,522
Never mind, Corky.

303
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:55,861
Look! It's Rexy and the Ivy boys.

304
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,612
If it isn't the spaceship of love.

305
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:59,990
And it's throbbing away, I'm sure.

306
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,576
Can you believe it?
We actually caught up with these guys!

307
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,161
At 110 miles per hour,

308
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,746
I'm surprised
we didn't run them over.

309
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:06,872
Really!

310
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,598
Looks like Rex has other things
on his mind besides me.

311
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,183
Oh!

312
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,518
Fill it up, okay?

313
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,947
Okay. ls there anything else?

314
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:43,617
Gaskets? New upholstery?
Retreads? Paint job?

315
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,660
No, I think that's about it.

316
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,245
I think everything's okey-dokey.

317
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,413
- O key-dokey?
- Yeah.

318
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,463
Wait!

319
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:05,764
Is that it?

320
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,849
Well, the air cleaner.

321
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:10,727
We've been having trouble
with the suction.

322
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:16,358
Rex, I know you're in there!
Now open this door now!

323
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,277
Ladies!

324
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:20,904
May I be of some assistance here?

325
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,197
Not unless you can open that door.

326
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,657
No problem. Hair pin?

327
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:27,118
- Heather!
- Listen, if you guys aren't busy later...

328
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,873
You can't see a thing.

329
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,668
Come on, Rex has got
business to take care of.

330
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,509
Heather! Hi.

331
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:46,471
Peaches!
What are you doing here?

332
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:50,225
That's it. That does it.
It's over!

333
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,644
Maybe dinner?
Some dancing?

334
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:53,979
You're an asshole!

335
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:55,230
Asshole already?

336
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:56,481
Heather, wait a minute!

337
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,109
Chuck, next time don't drink
out of the toilet bowl

338
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,277
till I check it first, okay?

339
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,821
- Heather...
- Not now.

340
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:05,323
Heather!

341
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,783
I have nothing to say to you.

342
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,410
I'm sure if you just
took the time to get to know me

343
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:09,995
-we could work something out.
- Heather.

344
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,664
I don't even want to see you again, ever.
Do you understand that?

345
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,082
You are nothing
but a cheap, lying bastard.

346
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:16,209
- I've had enough!
- Calm down!

347
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:18,837
Who are you?
Get out of my way.

348
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,046
No, no, no. She's right.

349
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,799
You are a cheap, lying bastard
and we've had enough.

350
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,384
You stinking...

351
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,222
I'm so sorry, Heather! I...

352
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:31,641
Take your hands off her!

353
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:32,976
Take your hands off of me!

354
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,936
Take your hands off of her!

355
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,565
If ever I can be
of further assistance,

356
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,275
feel free to call on me.

357
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,569
Anytime, anywhere.

358
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,115
Thank you.

359
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,205
You son of a bitch.

360
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,086
Sorry.

361
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,964
You get in my way again,
and you're gonna be sorry you were born.

362
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,009
He knew then and there that the
friendship they had had since youth

363
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,219
had died a sudden
and tragic death,

364
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,013
destroyed by
the love of a woman.

365
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,312
Heather! Cupcake, listen to me!

366
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:18,855
Forget it, Rex! You're history!

367
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,149
Shit.

368
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,404
213.37 - TOTAL SALE
155.9 - GALLONS

369
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:28,281
$213.37?

370
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,160
Keep the change, pal.

371
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:47,676
I don't think I need
to remind you gentlemen

372
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,719
about the importance of this race.

373
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,847
I don't think I have to
bore you with the fact

374
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,016
that the Washington Military Institute

375
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,728
has won this race
for the past three years!

376
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,147
I don't think I need
to stress the fact

377
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,192
that we will win this race
at any cost,

378
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,362
because a corpsman,
in his heart, in his gut,

379
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:09,239
knows no such thing as defeat!

380
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:13,535
Victory is the only thing he'll eat.

381
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,745
And he'll eat it raw!

382
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,039
Will We Win?

383
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:19,249
Yes, sir!

384
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,209
Then move out!

385
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,211
Detail, hut!

386
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:31,386
All right, roll!

387
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,806
You see that?

388
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:41,021
WELCOME RIVER RACERS

389
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:48,278
A town like any other town.

390
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:50,613
A town with nothing to hide.

391
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,199
Until they arrived.

392
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:54,617
Okay!

393
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,582
Come on, Chuck.

394
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,376
Here we are.

395
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:05,837
Ladies.

396
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:14,679
Gonzer! Down, boy!
Down, boy. Here you go. Good boy.

397
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,519
Nice finger.

398
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:23,021
I was just checking out
the competition.

399
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:24,647
Come on, Chuck!

400
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:29,486
We're the men from WM!

401
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,404
Shalom aleichem.

402
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,783
Yeah, a few more guys...

403
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:38,787
Excuse me.

404
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,914
Is that spacelab
up there?

405
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:43,041
- No, I guess not.
- No.

406
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,053
The competition looks
a little weirder than I expected.

407
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:03,603
What's the matter, Chuck?
You're not thirsty?

408
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,194
Oh, it's the call, isn't it, Chuck?

409
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,239
It's reaching out to you.

410
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:15,865
It's pulling you from the gut.

411
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:17,283
Isn't that right, boy?

412
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:20,829
You meet me tomorrow morning,
10:00, at the portage.

413
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,372
Don't be late.

414
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:25,500
Come here, come here.
Come here, slugger.

415
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,756
Don't stay up all night,
and don't drink too much.

416
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,635
Remember that night on the west side
with that bitch, binga, binga?

417
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,053
Go on, get outta here.

418
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,432
Horny bastard.

419
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,400
Thank you.

420
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:54,904
Nice jugs.

421
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:02,537
Ringside seats.

422
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:07,083
Lively crowd, huh?

423
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:09,794
Hey, did you order me
that old fashioned?

424
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:12,172
Oh, yeah, just the way
you like it, extra bitters.

425
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:15,258
I knew I could count on you.
Here's to mediocrity.

426
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,218
Mediocrity, yeah!

427
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:25,435
Nice right cross.

428
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,273
Now, there's a girl
who knows how to party.

429
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,696
Gonz,
who ordered this?

430
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,239
I'll take it.

431
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:44,162
There's the woman-hitter
and his colleagues.

432
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:45,580
Nice hair.

433
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,419
I don't think he likes you.

434
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,675
Would you look at
all that beefcake.

435
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:01,012
The odds are definitely in our favor.

436
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,764
Take no prisoners.

437
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,686
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thanks.

438
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,063
My pleasure.

439
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:12,815
So you girls here
for the big race tomorrow?

440
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:16,110
No, actually,
we're here to get laid.

441
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:22,617
Look at that one there!

442
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,577
Gonzer, that's a guy.

443
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,167
Hey, can I buy you a drink, Irwin?

444
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:32,752
No, no, I'm fine.

445
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,212
Pink dress.

446
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,089
Max, no!

447
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:37,382
Come on.

448
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,178
Is it slowing?

449
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,402
- Way to go, Gonz!
- Good job, buddy!

450
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:02,615
Gentlemen!
Soldiers, the map! Once again.

451
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,242
Johnson!

452
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,327
We enter left,
we paddle right behind the big rock.

453
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:08,454
Then left again
past the dead tree, sir!

454
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:09,664
Brown !

455
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:11,791
Hard forward
till we reach the turn of the rapids,

456
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,126
then hug the shore, sir.

457
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:14,752
Lieutenant Whitney!

458
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,504
Baron's rapids,
head for the hole,

459
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:19,382
do a 360 degree turn
and paddle hard right, sir!

460
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:21,384
Good. Good.

461
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,220
Now it's time for night-night.

462
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:30,476
All right, guys, there's work to be done.
It's sabotage time.

463
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,573
- What do you want?
- Stoli with a twist.

464
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,286
Thank you.

465
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:09,015
Hey, want a little popcorn?

466
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:11,100
Oh! Excuse me.
Gosh, I spilled that.

467
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,269
I'll get it. That's...

468
00:29:17,774 --> 00:29:19,233
Hey, watch it.

469
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,069
Watch what?

470
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:23,988
Watch what a fool
I can make out of myself.

471
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:25,990
Is that worth watching?

472
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:27,867
I'm very good at it,

473
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,454
especially when I'm in the company
of such an attractive woman.

474
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,539
Haven't we met
somewhere before?

475
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,001
I suppose

476
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,670
next you're gonna ask me
if you can buy me a drink.

477
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,256
"Aha" he says to himself,

478
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,968
"here is a woman who knows
a come-on when she hears one.

479
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,763
"He thinks he's got her
where he wants her,

480
00:29:48,846 --> 00:29:50,473
"but he has to make sure."

481
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:52,809
Can I buy you a drink?

482
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:55,978
She refuses with a shake
of her beautiful head.

483
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,355
That's perfect!

484
00:29:57,438 --> 00:30:01,401
She's passed the second test,
but she's not an easy mark.

485
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:04,153
Still, he must try the last line.

486
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:05,947
What...

487
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,156
What's your major?

488
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,659
Gin and tonic.

489
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:10,993
Gin and tonic for the lady!

490
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:16,624
Make it two, will you?
Thank you, my man.

491
00:30:16,707 --> 00:30:18,501
You wanna fool around?
You wanna get married?

492
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,752
Want fellatio or what?

493
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:22,505
If I'm being too forward,
just tell me to back off.

494
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,382
How about a name first?

495
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:27,218
An old-fashioned girl,
I like that.

496
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,011
McGraw.

497
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:31,973
Bob McGraw.

498
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,268
Rex, where you going?

499
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,602
Hey, man!

500
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:39,063
I'm Heather.

501
00:30:39,897 --> 00:30:41,691
Heather Merriweather.

502
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:56,622
If I'm being too forward,
just tell me.

503
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:59,584
No, no, no. Not at all.

504
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:04,505
You know, it's a little crowded in here,
don't you think?

505
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:05,965
Smoky.

506
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,675
Noisy.

507
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:09,802
Crowded.

508
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,722
What do you say we go for a walk?

509
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,265
To my room.

510
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:15,683
What do you say we run?

511
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,270
What do you say
give me 10 minutes?

512
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,230
I'm in room 27.

513
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,357
Do you think
you can remember that?

514
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,611
I'll carve it in the back of my hand.

515
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,541
I guess this means no bedtime story.

516
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,336
If I'm not back in two hours,

517
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,921
borrow a book.

518
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:46,422
Book?

519
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:14,408
You beautiful bomb.

520
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,387
It was a night.

521
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,556
A real, wide open night

522
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,600
filled with the stars
of a thousand dreams.

523
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:43,563
It was the kind of night
that could only be found

524
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,982
in a place called the West.

525
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:49,819
Or maybe in a cheap spy novel.

526
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:53,906
The kind with gorgeous,
smooth-skinned women

527
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,660
with accents and .45 caliber lips.

528
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:10,840
My, how time flies.
You dropped this!

529
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,726
Are you all right?

530
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,688
I'm gonna...

531
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,815
I'm gonna get...

532
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:29,525
I'm gonna get...

533
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:35,906
Who's "ooh"?

534
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,342
Who is it?

535
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:00,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

536
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:03,893
Why don't you come on in
and shut the door?

537
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:09,732
Why don't you lock it?

538
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:17,657
- Why don't you...
- I think I can take it from here.

539
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:26,749
Well...

540
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,834
Here we are.

541
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:31,379
All by ourselves.

542
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:32,546
With the door locked.

543
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,508
And me lying on the bed
in a robe.

544
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:40,638
I like a woman
who's not afraid to play hard to get.

545
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,141
I like a man
who's not afraid to play hard.

546
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:50,690
You know something,
Bob McGraw?

547
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:54,068
You look a little warm.

548
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:57,905
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable?

549
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:01,325
I didn't bring anything
"more comfortable."

550
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,620
Well, how about me?

551
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,375
You talked me into it.

552
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:19,885
For crying out loud.

553
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:23,097
This is a race, not a battlefield.

554
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:26,892
With blatant disregard
for rules and regulations,

555
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,895
frivolous misuse of
equipment and personnel...

556
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:32,690
Where did you learn
to be a soldier, soldier?

557
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:33,941
The institute, sir.

558
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:35,526
Well, I hope, for your sake,

559
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,319
the institute is a lenient one.

560
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,824
Under the circumstances,
I have no choice

561
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,660
but to impound your raft
and disqualify you.

562
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:55,296
MOOSEHEAD

563
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,136
- Tell me something.
- What?

564
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,432
Was that as good for you
as it was for me?

565
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:09,143
No. It was...

566
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,522
Heather, it's Rex!
Are you in there?

567
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:15,816
- Company. How nice.
- Heather!

568
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,652
Rex, go away!
I have nothing to say to you.

569
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:21,280
You can just stay right here
and just ignore him, okay?

570
00:36:21,363 --> 00:36:22,698
I hate to eat and run, but...

571
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,787
Bob, am I ever
gonna see you again?

572
00:36:28,537 --> 00:36:30,581
We are going to
see each other again.

573
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,625
You wouldn't lie to me?

574
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:35,044
Of course I'd lie to you,
I'm a guy.

575
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,004
But I'm not lying now.

576
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,507
You mean it?

577
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,674
Honest.

578
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:46,972
Hey, GUYS,

579
00:36:47,056 --> 00:36:49,141
it's a little early for the Easter parade,
don't you think?

580
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,018
Look! It's Hailey's comet!

581
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,730
Bright, real bright. Bye!

582
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:16,836
Hello, asshole.

583
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,712
Oops.

584
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,549
Things looked bad for McGraw.
He had to think fast.

585
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,179
Get him!

586
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,098
Oh, shit! Hold it!

587
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,683
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Guys, guys...

588
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:33,310
Now, I know you're wondering
why I called you all here tonight,

589
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:35,938
because I want to talk
to you about herpes.

590
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:48,909
That's the end of that chapter.

591
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,330
I don't wanna die tomorrow!

592
00:37:53,414 --> 00:37:56,166
You know I hate water.
It ruins a good drink.

593
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,460
Oh, I'm gonna
projectile vomit on everyone!

594
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:00,462
Excuse me.

595
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:03,007
What am I, a turnstile?

596
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,093
Bay mist.

597
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:10,306
No, it's either
Misty Crevice or Savage Truth.

598
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,933
No, no, Bay Mist,
I'm telling you.

599
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,313
Bob!

600
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:21,025
What happened?
Are you okay?

601
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,193
Bob, it's us!

602
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,656
Oh, boy!
Am I glad to see you guys.

603
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,409
This is a terrible place
to spend the night alone.

604
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:31,952
Who did it?

605
00:38:32,703 --> 00:38:34,496
They got you, too?

606
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,040
Bob, how many were there?

607
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:38,042
I didn't get all their names,

608
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:42,546
but they all wore
the same cologne.

609
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:50,054
You know, this is gonna be
a piece of fucking cake.

610
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:55,392
Good afternoon and welcome
to this year's annual collegiate

611
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,311
White Water Rafting Race.

612
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:00,940
It's a perfect day
for rapid competition.

613
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:03,817
The temperature is
a comfortable 86 degrees,

614
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:06,987
the water at
a refreshing 53 degrees.

615
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:11,408
With the disqualification
of last year's winner,

616
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:13,661
Washington Military Institute,

617
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:15,871
we have 13 entries this year.

618
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:19,541
Good luck to all
of our participants!

619
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:25,589
It's either lose or win

620
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:28,676
You'll either break or bend

621
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:31,428
Pushing it one more inch

622
00:39:31,512 --> 00:39:34,848
You better be steady, boy

623
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:37,977
It's waiting all for you

624
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,105
Need to give all you've got

625
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:43,649
It's time to take your shot

626
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,986
You got nothing to lose

627
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:01,500
I thought we got rid of him.

628
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,420
Well, he's obviously a slow learner.

629
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:18,934
Bob, what happened?

630
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:22,354
Does it hurt?

631
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:25,024
Not so much anymore,
now that you're here.

632
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,400
Was it that creep?

633
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:29,153
Let's just say I slipped
on a bar of soap in the shower

634
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:30,612
as a bus ran out of control

635
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,322
and crashed into
the medicine cabinet.

636
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:35,909
I'm really sorry.
ls there anything I can do?

637
00:40:35,993 --> 00:40:38,203
Actually,
I made a list, but, uh...

638
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,457
This will have to suffice
until the race is over.

639
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:51,759
Ten minutes!
Ten minutes to starting time!

640
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,344
Okay, come on, guys!
Where's your spirit?

641
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:57,639
We oughta give these teams
some support!

642
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:02,102
Come on, we can't send
'em down the river with nothing.

643
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:03,520
What do you say?

644
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,233
Yeah! What do you say?

645
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:26,335
There they are.

646
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:31,590
All getting ready for
the start of their little race.

647
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:36,303
Does that civilian mashed potato
think he can disqualify us?

648
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,181
They'll see.

649
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,225
They'll see!

650
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,353
The race will continue for two days.

651
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:47,606
Today you will race
to this point, Beaver Flats,

652
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:50,192
where the first five teams
will pick up flags.

653
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:53,028
And only the first five teams
to pick up flags

654
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:54,780
will be in the second day.

655
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:56,949
And those of you who pick up flags

656
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:58,992
will then portage to Chicken Falls

657
00:41:59,076 --> 00:42:01,203
where you will spend the night
and turn in your flags.

658
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,872
Then tomorrow morning at 10:00,

659
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,291
you will continue the race downriver.

660
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:10,379
Now, you all come here to represent
your colleges and your universities.

661
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:13,257
You have come here
to participate in an annual event

662
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,053
that shows good, healthy
American competition is still alive.

663
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:21,890
Before we start the race,

664
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,017
I'd like to thank you for participating,

665
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,937
wish you good luck, godspeed,

666
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,647
and may the best team win.

667
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,320
There he is.

668
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:38,031
There he is.

669
00:42:38,532 --> 00:42:42,369
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch
if it's the last thing I ever do!

670
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:49,042
All right.
Rafters, man your paddles!

671
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:53,672
Ready.

672
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:58,260
Set.

673
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:11,064
<i>There's the gun, and they're off!</i>

674
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:14,359
We've got 13 rafts
racing for their school's honor.

675
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:17,279
The rivalry between
Arkansas Christian State

676
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:21,491
and St. Martings Bible College
heats up once again!

677
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:29,958
And they're hitting the water, folks!

678
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,879
<i>Oh, my, folks, this is bedlam!</i>

679
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:38,634
The ladies of Iowa A&M...

680
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:42,804
Uh-oh, what's this?
Oh, that's too bad,

681
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,682
looks like one more
faulty equipment.

682
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:49,895
We are now down
to nine rafts, just nine!

683
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:51,521
No, Bob!

684
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,400
Look, guys, please!
I don't wanna die!

685
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:58,737
I'm so young,
I've got my looks, I've got my health.

686
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,073
- I've got my whole life ahead of me!
- To the water!

687
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:02,950
I've got too much to live for!

688
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:05,577
Like what?

689
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,496
Like what? Like what?

690
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,872
Women.

691
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:11,833
There might be a woman out there
who might want to have sex with me.

692
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:21,134
And that's Ivy U!
Yes, Ivy U, this year's favorite.

693
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:24,221
Three, two, one!

694
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,020
Please don't make me do this.

695
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:35,065
Don't make me go, all right?
I'm gonna die!

696
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:38,235
I don't wanna die!
I wanna live!

697
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:45,409
Thanks. I needed that.

698
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:47,619
Shall we go?

699
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:55,961
Get him out of there!

700
00:44:57,379 --> 00:44:58,672
Get in here, Shamu!

701
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,427
Hey, that's good.

702
00:45:46,386 --> 00:45:47,721
All right.

703
00:45:48,597 --> 00:45:50,265
Give me a hard left.

704
00:45:55,812 --> 00:45:58,440
Their situation seemed utterly hopeless.

705
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:00,359
And with damn good reason.

706
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:16,416
Yeah! All right!

707
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:26,385
Pull! Pull!

708
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:30,555
Come on!

709
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:07,968
This is it, guys.

710
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:11,638
We can do it, guys,
I know we can. I can feel it.

711
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,807
It's just water and rock, that's all!

712
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,351
We'll show this river who's boss!

713
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:18,061
This river will be ours!

714
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,734
This is not a good sign.

715
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:26,278
No.

716
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,283
Sorry, guys,
I guess I got a little carried away.

717
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,669
Stop! Stop!

718
00:47:44,212 --> 00:47:46,506
Oh, my God!

719
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:22,501
- That was great!
- We did it!

720
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,880
I don't believe it!

721
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:30,509
Son of a bitch, we did it.
And we're still alive!

722
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:33,094
Un-fucking-believable!

723
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:35,805
Wasn't bad for
a bunch of losers!

724
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:40,018
Well, you have just made it through
the world's most dangerous rapid!

725
00:48:40,268 --> 00:48:42,646
And now, it's beer time!

726
00:48:44,397 --> 00:48:47,108
I risked my life,
and you give me light beer?

727
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:50,779
Lepetomane!
Lepetomane!

728
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,280
Lepetomane!

729
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:58,453
Das raft!

730
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:00,872
We toast you!

731
00:49:02,374 --> 00:49:04,584
Hey, where've you
Nazis been, huh?

732
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:06,044
Didn't you see us
go through those rapids?

733
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:07,879
You think we're
kidding around here?

734
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,676
Hi, boys!

735
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:15,011
Shoot him, Rex.

736
00:49:15,637 --> 00:49:17,889
I don't like those guys.

737
00:49:19,432 --> 00:49:21,518
I warned you, you bozo!

738
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:29,025
What the hell is that?

739
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:31,361
Oh, they hit us with a little dart.

740
00:49:32,571 --> 00:49:34,364
Good shot, Rex, good shot.

741
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,450
Bob, it's ticking.

742
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:50,380
Five, four, three, two, one!

743
00:49:55,677 --> 00:49:57,178
Take that, suckers!

744
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:01,725
Were those the guys
that got you last night?

745
00:50:01,808 --> 00:50:03,018
How could ya tell?

746
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,978
They're all wearing
the same cologne.

747
00:50:06,896 --> 00:50:08,023
Come on, guys,

748
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:09,858
let's get the hell
out of Dodge!

749
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:19,075
All right, now get that rock
in the sling...

750
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,660
I'm going up!

751
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:29,085
- Push, man!
- I'm pushing!

752
00:50:43,391 --> 00:50:44,476
How we doing, guys?

753
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,602
Ready, Bob.

754
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:47,312
- Okay, let's go.
- Darn, it's empty.

755
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:50,774
Bob, it's empty.

756
00:50:50,857 --> 00:50:53,193
I gotta have a drink.
I don't think I can make it.

757
00:50:53,276 --> 00:50:54,402
You can do it, kid,
I know you can.

758
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:55,987
No,no,no.
I don't think I can.

759
00:50:57,072 --> 00:50:58,823
You're not trying.

760
00:50:59,908 --> 00:51:01,409
Lemme give it another shot.

761
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:03,536
I knew you could do it.

762
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:06,623
Irwin.

763
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:20,970
All right. Left turn!

764
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:23,306
Forward easy!

765
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,736
- Push, man!
- I'm pushing!

766
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,656
Now!

767
00:51:40,782 --> 00:51:41,908
- Now?
- Now?

768
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,877
Unidentified flying asshole.

769
00:51:57,048 --> 00:51:58,967
- Party time!
- Two! Two!

770
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:41,634
Let's move!

771
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,474
BEAVER FLATS
PORTAGE

772
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:53,396
Where's Ivy U?

773
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,231
Who cares, as long as
they're not ahead of us!

774
00:52:55,315 --> 00:52:56,733
Let's go)!

775
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:00,862
Grab a flag!

776
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,240
Got a flag!

777
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,119
- Brown.
- Sir!

778
00:53:08,244 --> 00:53:09,579
- Johnson.
- Sir!

779
00:53:09,662 --> 00:53:11,414
Good job, men, good job!

780
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,252
Whitney.

781
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,421
Soon...

782
00:53:21,883 --> 00:53:23,176
Soon.

783
00:53:41,694 --> 00:53:42,987
Look at that!

784
00:53:43,071 --> 00:53:45,198
Now, that can stop us.

785
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:47,158
Duck! Duck!

786
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:04,050
Say your prayers, gentlemen.

787
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:10,557
Come on, come on!
They're gonna get past!

788
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,933
Now!

789
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,729
It's going the wrong way!

790
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,654
- Go! Go!
- Move it! Move it!

791
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:48,887
Tonight, we are gonna be
in bimbette's heaven!

792
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:52,056
Good work!

793
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:54,309
All right, now, Rocky,

794
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,352
get one flag
and lose the other!

795
00:54:56,436 --> 00:54:57,770
Gotcha.

796
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:00,189
Let's go, man.

797
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:03,026
- One, two...
- Yeah!

798
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,405
Keep it up, guys-

799
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,032
Keep it going.

800
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,159
I know it's tough.

801
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:12,827
And I know that
you know it's tough.

802
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,079
But try not to think about it.

803
00:55:15,538 --> 00:55:17,415
Think about those degrees
we're gonna get

804
00:55:17,498 --> 00:55:19,417
when we win this race!

805
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,461
Maybe that'll help you
forget the pain.

806
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,800
More likely it won't,
but give it a shot.

807
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:32,388
Your bag of goodies
was a real bargain, Doctor.

808
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:33,556
You bet your bottom dollar.

809
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,766
There's only four boats left.

810
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:37,852
I think we earned
that little soiree of yours tonight.

811
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,771
St. Martings, Sara Teasdale,
Texas State, and us.

812
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:41,439
And Lepetomane.

813
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:42,982
- Lepetomane?
- What?

814
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:45,443
We took care of those remedials
after the first rapids!

815
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:47,654
Well, whoever "we" is
didn't do a very thorough job,

816
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:48,947
'cause they're still on the river.

817
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,156
- What?
- I don't believe it.

818
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:52,075
I thought we nailed those Twinkies!

819
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,252
Control tower to Ivy,
you're cleared for takeoff.

820
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:07,173
I love it.

821
00:56:12,387 --> 00:56:14,013
I don't like the sound of this.

822
00:56:15,264 --> 00:56:18,142
It's too quiet.

823
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:21,813
What could it be?

824
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:24,357
Indians!

825
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:30,405
What the hell is that?

826
00:56:31,072 --> 00:56:32,490
Sounds like big mosquitoes.

827
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:43,334
It's coming at us!

828
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:44,961
Get down!

829
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:51,092
It's coming back!

830
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,303
Bob, get down!

831
00:56:55,763 --> 00:56:56,973
This is dangerous!

832
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,060
How'd you like that, guys?

833
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:11,070
This has gone far enough!

834
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:14,907
He's right!
It's gone far enough!

835
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:24,250
Gonz! Get down!

836
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:33,468
Abandon ship!

837
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:35,928
- Get out! Get out!
- Not again!

838
00:57:36,804 --> 00:57:38,306
Kamikaze!

839
00:57:45,855 --> 00:57:48,274
Let's see you get out of that one,
you dipshit!

840
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:49,442
Let's get out of here.

841
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:50,777
Max!

842
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,696
Hey, Max!

843
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:02,038
I want the blond!

844
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:03,748
- You putz!
- Are those real breasts?

845
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,754
I want leverage!

846
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:14,342
Him, his doggie,
one of his men, anyone!

847
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,928
Reconnoiter 0600 sharp!

848
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,682
Come back with a prisoner,

849
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,685
or don't come back!

850
00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:26,062
Yes, sir!

851
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,940
Hey, it's Chuck!

852
00:58:29,023 --> 00:58:31,317
Wow, he's got the last flag!

853
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:37,490
What is this?
An attitude?

854
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:40,618
I'm sorry if we were a little bit late,

855
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:42,620
we had a few problems.

856
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:45,248
We weren't out on the town
like someone I could mention.

857
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:47,959
- Chuck, he was mugged last night!
- Let him be!

858
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:49,752
If he wants to be
a complete jerk, let him.

859
00:58:49,919 --> 00:58:51,712
I don't think we need to
explain to him that somebody

860
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:55,258
tried to destroy our raft,
knock us out of the race.

861
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:57,260
No, if he's gonna get
his nose bent out of shape

862
00:58:57,343 --> 00:58:59,095
over a little lost time,

863
00:58:59,178 --> 00:59:01,597
I'd rather not talk to him, either.
You're a dog.

864
00:59:02,598 --> 00:59:03,683
Grab the raft.

865
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:10,481
I suppose it doesn't make any difference
that they beat up Bob?

866
00:59:11,774 --> 00:59:15,069
That's right. Pipes, bottles,
chains, hitting, pain...

867
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:17,280
There were 10 of 'em.
Ten big ones.

868
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,031
Maybe eleven.

869
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:21,909
Oh, and you should've heard
the names they called him.

870
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:26,372
Sensitive dog.

871
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:32,170
Yes, okay, okay, I forgive you.

872
00:59:32,253 --> 00:59:34,422
I know you were playing hard to get.

873
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,258
Chuck, what is it?

874
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,467
I smell it, too.

875
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:40,219
It smells like...

876
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,637
Cologne.

877
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:48,978
Suddenly he knew what
the night held in store for them.

878
00:59:50,062 --> 00:59:52,190
And he liked the smell of it.

879
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:57,945
Are you okay?

880
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,324
You know something?

881
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:05,119
I really thought that McGraw
had a chance.

882
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:06,913
I mean, however slim,

883
01:00:06,996 --> 01:00:08,915
I really thought
that he might make it.

884
01:00:09,749 --> 01:00:11,459
I would have liked
to have seen him again.

885
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:13,252
"Seen," young lady?

886
01:00:13,336 --> 01:00:14,670
For starters.

887
01:00:14,754 --> 01:00:16,881
You mean to tell me
you're not coming?

888
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:18,674
No.

889
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:20,509
Okey-dokey, honey.
See ya later.

890
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,221
- Happy trails.
- Bye-bye, hon.

891
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,529
Revenge is a dish
best eaten cold

892
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:42,448
and with your hands.

893
01:00:51,499 --> 01:00:53,960
It's a little early
for Christmas, isn't it?

894
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:24,407
Tomorrow should be a breeze.

895
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,409
By the time you cross that finish line,

896
01:01:26,492 --> 01:01:29,745
I'm betting that yours
is the only raft on the river.

897
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:54,103
Let's have some more champagne!

898
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,533
Waiter!

899
01:02:23,758 --> 01:02:25,468
Wait a minute, I know that dog!

900
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:28,637
I know that dog!

901
01:02:29,263 --> 01:02:30,973
Hey, what's going on?

902
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:32,767
Wait a minute!

903
01:02:47,406 --> 01:02:48,783
Well, well, what is this?

904
01:02:48,866 --> 01:02:50,785
A meeting of the assholes of America?

905
01:02:50,951 --> 01:02:52,244
Look who's here.

906
01:02:52,328 --> 01:02:53,579
We missed you guys!

907
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:55,247
We didn't miss you, you jerk.

908
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:57,458
Hurry up, put that on!
I haven't got all night!

909
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,793
You asshole!

910
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,503
Oh, excuse me.

911
01:03:19,188 --> 01:03:21,315
You wouldn't hit a lady,
would you?

912
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,324
Mocha.

913
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:40,167
No,no,no,no!
No. No.

914
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:43,504
Get out, come on.

915
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,299
Now I got you, you bastard.

916
01:03:49,343 --> 01:03:51,720
It's so much better this way.

917
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:56,100
So much for the piano.

918
01:03:59,478 --> 01:04:01,147
Bob. The tub.

919
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:04,692
Bye.

920
01:04:05,151 --> 01:04:06,694
Table for one.

921
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:22,960
You incompetent twits!

922
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,839
Let's get outta here!

923
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:46,775
There you are.

924
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:50,821
Bob! Where have you been?
What's going on around here?

925
01:04:50,905 --> 01:04:53,115
It's such a long story.

926
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:56,994
Gosh, is there someplace
that we can talk?

927
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:04,001
Well, is there someplace
that we can pet heavily?

928
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:15,930
Terrific!

929
01:05:16,388 --> 01:05:17,473
Look at that!

930
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,685
Wait! What...

931
01:05:31,654 --> 01:05:33,239
Now, tell me,

932
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:38,327
was it as good for you
as it was for me that time?

933
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,539
Not exactly.

934
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:44,667
Bob! Irwings gone,
we can't find him anywhere.

935
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,627
I think something happened to him.

936
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:48,712
Did I interrupt anything?

937
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,341
Not exactly.

938
01:05:52,424 --> 01:05:54,218
Look, I'll meet you at the raft.

939
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:55,803
Oh, Max, this is Heather.
Heather, this Max.

940
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:56,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

941
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,682
Pleasure to meet you.

942
01:06:00,558 --> 01:06:01,600
Do you need any help?

943
01:06:02,184 --> 01:06:04,770
No, thanks. I've been
dressing myself for years.

944
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:07,022
But I appreciate the offer.

945
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:12,570
When this is over

946
01:06:12,653 --> 01:06:14,822
and somebody's won this damn thing,

947
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:16,991
I'd like to think I could
jump on you again sometime.

948
01:06:28,419 --> 01:06:30,713
Disqualify me, will they?

949
01:06:31,046 --> 01:06:35,092
Well, now I've got them
right where I want them!

950
01:06:35,843 --> 01:06:38,762
You thought the disguise would fool me?

951
01:06:40,598 --> 01:06:43,058
They can't beat me. No!

952
01:06:43,642 --> 01:06:46,353
Because I'm the cream
of the military crop,

953
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:48,814
and I have a hostage.

954
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:52,943
A living, human hostage!

955
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,571
I can't find Irwin anywhere.

956
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,072
Poor little guy.

957
01:06:57,156 --> 01:06:58,907
Hey, Gonz, don't you worry.

958
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:01,285
We're gonna find lrwin
if it takes a hundred years.

959
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:03,454
Hey, Bob.
He'll be dead by then.

960
01:07:04,288 --> 01:07:05,706
Good point.

961
01:07:06,749 --> 01:07:07,875
Wait a minute.

962
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:10,127
Wait a minute!
What about Chuck?

963
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:14,506
Come on, Chuck.

964
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:17,009
I know you're tired,
but we need your help.

965
01:07:17,092 --> 01:07:19,762
We've got to find Irwin
before it's too late!

966
01:07:19,845 --> 01:07:21,764
We'll take the water,
you take the land. Whaddya say?

967
01:07:21,847 --> 01:07:22,931
Come on, Chuck,
you remember Irwin.

968
01:07:23,015 --> 01:07:25,142
He's got glasses,
he's skinny, he drinks a lot.

969
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:29,855
Here, Chuck, here. Try this.

970
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,691
You remember him now,
don't you, Chuck?

971
01:07:34,652 --> 01:07:36,695
All right. All right, Chuck,

972
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,031
there's a new collar
in it for you, huh?

973
01:07:39,114 --> 01:07:41,241
Does that jar your memory?

974
01:07:42,242 --> 01:07:43,661
Okey, Okey.

975
01:07:44,203 --> 01:07:46,997
No more plain-wrap dog food.
Does that ring any bells for you?

976
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:52,336
I'll put you up for stud.
But that's it, take it or leave it.

977
01:07:59,927 --> 01:08:01,095
Boy, what's the world coming to

978
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:03,305
when you have to
bribe your own dog?

979
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:04,723
The dog's a whore, Bob.

980
01:08:04,807 --> 01:08:06,225
I trained him well.

981
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:11,522
Nobody does that to Ivy!

982
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:15,234
Guys, we got a race to win here,
act like adults.

983
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:17,611
I'm gonna get that weenie!

984
01:08:17,736 --> 01:08:19,613
We're gonna get that weenie!

985
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:21,323
We're gonna win this race!

986
01:08:21,448 --> 01:08:24,118
Geez, Rex, too much caffeine
making you tense?

987
01:08:24,952 --> 01:08:27,705
After last night,
you wanna go again, huh?

988
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:29,748
- That's right.
- You must've liked it, huh?

989
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:30,958
I'm ready and willing.

990
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:33,419
- I'm always able.
- All right! Nice!

991
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:35,421
Left turn, men,
we've got company!

992
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:36,630
What?

993
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,136
Check it out.

994
01:08:42,845 --> 01:08:44,596
- Hey.
- The bleach boys.

995
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,932
Good afternoon, ladies!

996
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,268
All right, guys, listen.

997
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:50,853
We're gonna beat 'em,
and we're gonna win,

998
01:08:50,936 --> 01:08:52,896
and let's go into a hard forward.

999
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:56,525
The instrument, maestro,
if you will.

1000
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:58,694
See ya, ladies!

1001
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:01,697
They'll like this, won't they?

1002
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,866
- What's that?
- What the hell is that?

1003
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:05,367
All right,
sweetheart.

1004
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:10,581
- It's a torpedo.
- Oh, shit!

1005
01:09:18,297 --> 01:09:19,965
Good shot, Rex, good shot!

1006
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:22,301
You jerks!

1007
01:09:27,347 --> 01:09:28,390
Adios, ladies!

1008
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:34,313
We got those morons.
So let's go get Lepetomane!

1009
01:09:35,564 --> 01:09:37,483
Well done, soldiers, well done!

1010
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,280
From here, we take the island.

1011
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:45,115
We beach the craft in the south,

1012
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,242
then move to a high point above.

1013
01:09:47,326 --> 01:09:51,622
Then, we hang the bait, and wait!

1014
01:09:52,331 --> 01:09:53,957
Now move out!

1015
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:59,129
Stroke! Stroke!

1016
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:01,256
Stroke!

1017
01:10:01,673 --> 01:10:03,091
Stroke!

1018
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,846
Johnson,

1019
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,807
ready the jet.

1020
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,809
Yes, sir.

1021
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:16,563
Brown, ready the wireless control system.

1022
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:17,898
Yes, sir.

1023
01:10:21,902 --> 01:10:23,987
It's those G.l. Joe guys!

1024
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:26,949
- Where?
- There.

1025
01:10:31,954 --> 01:10:33,497
Get back in your pouch!

1026
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:36,708
They got lrwin!
In a wet bag!

1027
01:10:38,627 --> 01:10:39,962
Come on!

1028
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:42,840
It's toboggan time!

1029
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:46,093
Wait a minute, Bob!
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1030
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:48,136
Nah, but at this point
it's beside the point.

1031
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,805
Oh, boy.

1032
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:52,516
Forward easy.

1033
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:57,062
Bob!No!

1034
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:00,816
- Too fast! Too fast!
- Shit!

1035
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:05,070
No!

1036
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:10,909
We're gonna get wet again!

1037
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:19,877
Nice shot, Bob.

1038
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,587
Come on!
Irwings getting away!

1039
01:11:24,339 --> 01:11:26,884
All right, so I miscalculated.
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1040
01:11:27,092 --> 01:11:28,844
I'll think about it.

1041
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,430
Stroke!

1042
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:32,806
Stroke!

1043
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,182
Stroke!

1044
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,767
- Stroke!
- Sir!

1045
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:38,979
The island's just up ahead, sir!

1046
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:41,565
Good. Good.

1047
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:43,901
I'm ready with the jet, sir.

1048
01:11:43,984 --> 01:11:47,070
Ready with the wireless
control system, sir.

1049
01:11:49,907 --> 01:11:51,074
Now!

1050
01:12:05,339 --> 01:12:08,300
Victory! We are men!

1051
01:12:44,962 --> 01:12:46,630
All right, meatheads!

1052
01:12:46,713 --> 01:12:49,049
What are you sitting around for?
This is no picnic!

1053
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:50,676
Captain, we can't win.

1054
01:12:50,759 --> 01:12:52,594
We were disqualified yesterday.

1055
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:55,389
Disqualified?
We're not disqualified!

1056
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:58,392
Not till I say we're disqualified!

1057
01:12:58,684 --> 01:13:01,603
It takes a river to win this war.

1058
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:05,440
And there can't be a winner,

1059
01:13:05,524 --> 01:13:07,776
if there isn't a river!

1060
01:13:08,193 --> 01:13:09,319
Sir?

1061
01:13:10,278 --> 01:13:13,949
We're gonna blow the mother up!

1062
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:28,255
All right!

1063
01:13:28,338 --> 01:13:29,631
Women!

1064
01:13:34,219 --> 01:13:35,637
What is she doing out there?

1065
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:37,764
Getting tanned.

1066
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:39,975
Forward easy.

1067
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:46,314
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1068
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:49,526
Let me guess what happened.

1069
01:13:50,402 --> 01:13:51,695
That good old Ivy U.

1070
01:13:51,778 --> 01:13:54,948
You didn't have to tell me,
I woulda caught it.

1071
01:13:59,036 --> 01:14:01,246
Those guys almost killed us.

1072
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,249
He's beginning to get a little nervy.

1073
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:07,419
The thought of them winning this race
really makes me sick.

1074
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,422
It isn't over yet.

1075
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:12,132
Well, what are we waiting for?

1076
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:15,844
Just a few indecent thoughts.

1077
01:14:19,806 --> 01:14:21,725
Okay, I'm ready now.

1078
01:14:21,808 --> 01:14:24,853
First, we get Irwin.
Then we get the trophy!

1079
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:27,647
Hey, you guys!
I'll see you later, okay?

1080
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,900
Revenge! Revenge!
Get 'em!

1081
01:14:32,027 --> 01:14:33,153
Forward easy!

1082
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:39,659
Soon the river will go ka-boom!

1083
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:45,248
A commander couldn't ask
for better soldiers.

1084
01:14:57,552 --> 01:14:58,804
Well,

1085
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:01,014
while we're waiting for your captain

1086
01:15:01,098 --> 01:15:02,974
to come to your rescue,

1087
01:15:03,058 --> 01:15:05,143
maybe I should
warm up on you a little.

1088
01:15:05,227 --> 01:15:06,895
No? All right.

1089
01:15:08,647 --> 01:15:11,650
How about the old bamboo
under the fingernails?

1090
01:15:12,484 --> 01:15:15,153
It's a personal favorite of mine,

1091
01:15:15,237 --> 01:15:17,489
and a nice way to loosen up, too,

1092
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:19,533
you little schmo!

1093
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:25,664
No!

1094
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:48,103
Chuck, puppy! Am I glad to see you!
Where the hell you been?

1095
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,605
Chuck, we're in
some kind of trouble, okay?

1096
01:15:50,689 --> 01:15:52,274
The guys are heading
right in for a trap,

1097
01:15:52,357 --> 01:15:53,441
we gotta warn 'em, all right?

1098
01:15:53,525 --> 01:15:55,235
So get me outta here.
Come on. Get me out.

1099
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:57,696
What are you doing?
No, Chuck!

1100
01:15:59,072 --> 01:16:01,366
No, don't do...
Where are you going with those?

1101
01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:03,034
Don't leave me!

1102
01:16:03,368 --> 01:16:05,203
Chuck... What's that?

1103
01:16:05,453 --> 01:16:07,622
What are you doing?
Don't put that on there!

1104
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:10,458
Chuck! Where you going?

1105
01:16:11,251 --> 01:16:13,670
No! No, Chuck, no!

1106
01:16:14,045 --> 01:16:16,339
Chuck, no! Chuck...
I can't... Not like...

1107
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:18,175
This is not good, Chuck!

1108
01:16:18,258 --> 01:16:20,385
Oh, God, I'm so depressed!

1109
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:40,780
Irwin...

1110
01:16:42,282 --> 01:16:43,742
Irwin...

1111
01:16:45,452 --> 01:16:46,912
Irwin...

1112
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:49,164
Irwin.

1113
01:16:49,497 --> 01:16:50,874
Irwin!

1114
01:16:51,499 --> 01:16:52,876
Irwin!

1115
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:56,546
Irwin! Irwin!

1116
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,839
Irwin!

1117
01:16:58,089 --> 01:17:01,343
Irwin! lrwin! lrwin!

1118
01:17:01,426 --> 01:17:03,011
What the hell?

1119
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:05,013
Let's wait here.

1120
01:17:05,305 --> 01:17:07,057
Irwin! Irwin! Irwin!

1121
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,517
Irwin! Irwin! Irwin!

1122
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:15,023
Hey, it's Chuck!

1123
01:17:15,106 --> 01:17:16,608
Hey! Chucker!

1124
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,990
Bob, it looks like
he's been drinking again.

1125
01:17:24,074 --> 01:17:25,492
No, not drinking.

1126
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:28,119
Look! In his mouth!
It's Irwings underwear.

1127
01:17:28,203 --> 01:17:29,746
No wonder he's acting like that.

1128
01:17:32,457 --> 01:17:34,209
That can only mean one thing!

1129
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,544
Irwings naked.

1130
01:17:37,462 --> 01:17:38,505
Right!

1131
01:17:38,588 --> 01:17:40,590
And Chuck knows where he is!

1132
01:17:40,674 --> 01:17:42,008
Let's go)!

1133
01:17:43,385 --> 01:17:45,804
Left turn!
Forward easy!

1134
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:48,765
They're quitting!
They've given up!

1135
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:51,851
I knew they didn't have what it takes!

1136
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:56,731
Hey! That's Lepetomane U
for ya, you degenerates!

1137
01:17:56,856 --> 01:17:59,567
Good old Lobotomy U!

1138
01:18:00,193 --> 01:18:02,237
Let's move out of here.

1139
01:18:02,696 --> 01:18:05,949
Let's just kick back and coast,
because the trophy is ours!

1140
01:18:07,325 --> 01:18:08,368
Scumbags!

1141
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,204
Hey, Chuck!

1142
01:18:12,289 --> 01:18:15,917
It's good to see you, too,
but first things first, huh?

1143
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:18,837
Now, where is he?
Where's Irwin, Chuck?

1144
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:22,966
Oh, my God!
They killed him!

1145
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:26,177
No, they haven't killed him,
but he's... He's...

1146
01:18:27,095 --> 01:18:28,763
He's lying on the ground somewhere!

1147
01:18:28,847 --> 01:18:29,973
Right, Chuck?

1148
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:32,642
No, on the nose!

1149
01:18:32,726 --> 01:18:35,228
But where is Irwin now, Chuck?
Where is he now?

1150
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,362
He's trying to
get into the wet bag.

1151
01:18:44,529 --> 01:18:47,991
- Wet bag, dirtbag, douchebag...
- Bag lady?

1152
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:53,371
He's got a bone...

1153
01:18:53,621 --> 01:18:55,040
Oh, my God!

1154
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:56,791
They cut him into steaks!

1155
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:02,547
They haven't cut him into steaks,
they've, uh, uh...

1156
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,508
They staked him to the ground!

1157
01:19:05,592 --> 01:19:08,345
Where is he, Chuck?
Where is Irwin now?

1158
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,680
Chuck, that's my jacket!

1159
01:19:10,764 --> 01:19:12,682
He's trying to tell us something!

1160
01:19:14,392 --> 01:19:16,311
They plucked him!

1161
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:22,359
I'm trying.

1162
01:19:22,442 --> 01:19:25,403
They haven't plucked him,
it's something to do with...

1163
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:26,696
Feathers! Feathers!

1164
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,199
No, those aren't feathers!
That's down!

1165
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,743
Down! Down! All right!

1166
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:34,496
Down something.
They've got Irwin down something.

1167
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:36,748
Come on, Chuck, where?
Give us another clue, quick!

1168
01:19:36,831 --> 01:19:37,874
Chuck, how many syllables?

1169
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,252
- Two!
- Two syllables!

1170
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:47,425
God! They cut out his liver!

1171
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:53,056
Down... Down...
Down liver... Uh...

1172
01:19:53,807 --> 01:19:54,891
I've got it!

1173
01:19:54,974 --> 01:19:56,226
- What?
- What?

1174
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:58,978
"Down liver," that's Japanese
for "downriver"!

1175
01:20:04,025 --> 01:20:05,276
All right, Chuck!

1176
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:08,488
Those were great clues.

1177
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,115
I thought they were kinda hard.

1178
01:20:17,038 --> 01:20:20,166
My sweet boom-boom maker.

1179
01:20:30,802 --> 01:20:32,554
Where's your doggie?

1180
01:20:32,637 --> 01:20:34,013
Look, I think there's been some mistake.

1181
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:36,141
Where's your underwear?

1182
01:20:36,224 --> 01:20:38,184
I don't know.
The dog ran off...

1183
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:39,811
Don't wanna cooperate, huh?

1184
01:20:41,688 --> 01:20:43,273
That's okay.

1185
01:20:43,982 --> 01:20:46,151
Your time is up anyway.

1186
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,654
Say VOW prayers,

1187
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:53,241
you pinko commie slime!

1188
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:55,493
Slime?

1189
01:20:56,286 --> 01:20:58,746
No shooting with the gun, please!

1190
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,874
Oh, look,
if we can talk about this...

1191
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:08,840
Oh, hi, guys.
Glad you could stop by.

1192
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:12,677
Well, well, well.

1193
01:21:13,386 --> 01:21:15,680
You finally decided
to show your face, eh?

1194
01:21:17,223 --> 01:21:19,058
Well, you walked
right into my little trap,

1195
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:21,144
and you'll never get out alive.

1196
01:21:29,444 --> 01:21:30,904
Be my guest.

1197
01:21:35,408 --> 01:21:36,951
Take my money!
Anything you want! No, anything!

1198
01:21:37,035 --> 01:21:39,496
Go ahead, just ask me,
I'll tell you anything! Anything!

1199
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,498
I'd like to know
what he did with my pants.

1200
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:48,838
Good for you.
Son of a bitch.

1201
01:21:50,215 --> 01:21:51,424
Irwin!

1202
01:21:51,925 --> 01:21:53,885
Just in time to turn me over.

1203
01:21:56,054 --> 01:21:58,723
What's he doing?
He should be here by now!

1204
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:01,142
Johnson,

1205
01:22:01,226 --> 01:22:02,685
go get Captain Braverman.

1206
01:22:02,769 --> 01:22:05,271
You go get him.
I don't miss him.

1207
01:22:05,396 --> 01:22:07,524
Johnson, you see this?
You know what this means?

1208
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:11,361
Hey, you see this, sparky?
You know what this means, huh?

1209
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:15,949
What do you got there, Chuck?

1210
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,492
What is that?

1211
01:22:17,575 --> 01:22:19,869
Oh, laughing gas.

1212
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:30,964
Men? Men!

1213
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:35,843
The enemy is upon us!

1214
01:22:37,136 --> 01:22:38,513
Charge!

1215
01:22:40,473 --> 01:22:41,641
Gosh, is he dead?

1216
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:43,726
I sure as hell hope so.

1217
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:05,123
That one, right there!

1218
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:06,833
You get him, we'll take the others.

1219
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:21,431
There's nothing like the peace
and quiet of the wilderness.

1220
01:23:21,514 --> 01:23:22,599
Shall we go?

1221
01:23:22,682 --> 01:23:23,725
- I think we should.
- Absolutely.

1222
01:23:26,394 --> 01:23:27,854
Hey, guys,
where you been?

1223
01:23:28,187 --> 01:23:29,772
Taking care of
a little unfinished business.

1224
01:23:29,856 --> 01:23:31,190
You know, returning a favor.

1225
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:33,234
Irwin, you look good!

1226
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:34,944
I feel good. Can't complain.

1227
01:23:35,653 --> 01:23:37,238
GUYS, guys...

1228
01:23:37,322 --> 01:23:38,740
Enough of this hearts and flowers stuff.

1229
01:23:38,823 --> 01:23:41,659
What do you say
we win this race for us?

1230
01:23:45,204 --> 01:23:47,874
No, no. You dickhead.

1231
01:23:47,957 --> 01:23:51,377
You weren't supposed to get it engraved
until after they cross the finish line.

1232
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:52,545
Now hide it.

1233
01:23:57,842 --> 01:23:59,469
Five minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

1234
01:24:00,845 --> 01:24:03,806
Five minutes and counting.
Any bets?

1235
01:24:08,936 --> 01:24:10,313
Keep it steady.

1236
01:24:10,396 --> 01:24:11,773
That's it.

1237
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:16,152
You know, guys, I can see it all now.

1238
01:24:16,402 --> 01:24:17,779
All of us being
carried around the square

1239
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:19,822
on the shoulders
of cheering hordes.

1240
01:24:19,906 --> 01:24:23,660
Co-eds beating down our doors,
chaining themselves to our beds.

1241
01:24:24,952 --> 01:24:27,246
We're gonna get laid
for six months off this one.

1242
01:24:27,538 --> 01:24:30,458
Are you kidding? We're gonna be inducted
into the stud hall of fame.

1243
01:24:31,042 --> 01:24:33,002
I thought we already were.
I know I am.

1244
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:35,004
You're such an animal.

1245
01:24:35,088 --> 01:24:37,090
Come on!
Forward, men, let's do it!

1246
01:24:37,632 --> 01:24:39,133
Move! Let's go.

1247
01:24:39,217 --> 01:24:40,927
Hard forward, that's it.

1248
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,095
Keep it steady.

1249
01:25:09,455 --> 01:25:10,707
Powers.

1250
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:14,627
Powers... The plunger.

1251
01:25:15,712 --> 01:25:19,507
Powers!
That's an order, bean head!

1252
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:51,873
Stroke! Stroke!

1253
01:25:51,956 --> 01:25:53,791
Come on, forward!

1254
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,461
So long, jerks!

1255
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:13,144
Go! Go!

1256
01:26:13,227 --> 01:26:14,645
Go! Go!

1257
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:23,863
Oh, God! You give great vibes.

1258
01:26:48,429 --> 01:26:49,514
Where's the river?

1259
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:56,938
There's the river!

1260
01:26:58,606 --> 01:26:59,774
My God!

1261
01:26:59,857 --> 01:27:02,026
Back paddle!
Back paddle!

1262
01:27:36,102 --> 01:27:37,353
We did it! Come on!

1263
01:27:37,854 --> 01:27:40,273
Another victory for the Mighty Crimson!

1264
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:55,538
Let's get out of here!

1265
01:28:01,168 --> 01:28:03,796
Oh, I think maybe
your toilet's overflowing.

1266
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,293
Cocktails, anyone?

1267
01:29:35,596 --> 01:29:37,932
There's Ivy!
There's Ivy!

1268
01:29:41,394 --> 01:29:42,520
There's the finish line!

1269
01:29:44,438 --> 01:29:47,984
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

1270
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,078
Come on, you guys!

1271
01:29:59,912 --> 01:30:01,372
See ya, Ivy!

1272
01:30:02,415 --> 01:30:03,958
They can't do that!

1273
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:05,918
- That's cheating!
- They can't do that!

1274
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:11,382
Yeah!

1275
01:30:23,185 --> 01:30:25,021
Team Lepetomane!

1276
01:30:25,396 --> 01:30:26,564
We did it!

1277
01:30:30,026 --> 01:30:31,902
Congratulations.

1278
01:31:00,598 --> 01:31:01,974
Tell me,

1279
01:31:02,558 --> 01:31:04,477
was it as good for you

1280
01:31:04,643 --> 01:31:06,979
as it was for me that time?

1281
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:09,732
- No.
- No?

1282
01:31:12,777 --> 01:31:14,320
It was better.

1283
01:31:30,669 --> 01:31:31,837
Bob...

1284
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,049
How big could it really be?

1285
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:39,887
Well, let's find out.

1286
01:31:55,903 --> 01:31:58,197
I'm up the creek

1287
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:02,201
I'm up the creek

1288
01:32:14,588 --> 01:32:18,259
Just like the one that got away

1289
01:32:18,634 --> 01:32:21,137
So close, but yet so far

1290
01:32:22,054 --> 01:32:24,807
I threw my hook into the water

1291
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:27,560
I nearly caught her

1292
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:29,019
How bizarre

1293
01:32:29,103 --> 01:32:31,522
Now I'm up the creek

1294
01:32:31,605 --> 01:32:33,440
Though I have lost a little pride

1295
01:32:33,524 --> 01:32:35,276
I'm up the creek

1296
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:37,820
I know that time is on my side

1297
01:32:37,903 --> 01:32:39,196
I'm up the creek

1298
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,198
Though you have pulled the plug on me

1299
01:32:41,282 --> 01:32:42,741
I'm up the creek

1300
01:32:42,825 --> 01:32:44,660
There's more than one fish in the sea

1301
01:32:44,743 --> 01:32:46,537
I'm not about to let it be

1302
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,664
I know that I am up the creek

1303
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,917
Hey! Hey!

1304
01:32:56,046 --> 01:32:58,924
The foreign legion's always there

1305
01:32:59,633 --> 01:33:02,136
I need a holiday

1306
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:05,931
Daydream in the desert

1307
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:08,434
With no pressure

1308
01:33:08,517 --> 01:33:12,396
That's the way
'cause I'm up the creek

1309
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:14,398
Though I have lost a little drive

1310
01:33:14,481 --> 01:33:16,233
I'm up the creek

1311
01:33:16,317 --> 01:33:18,068
I know that time is on my side

1312
01:33:18,152 --> 01:33:19,904
I'm up the creek

1313
01:33:19,987 --> 01:33:21,697
Though you have pulled the plug on me

1314
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,699
I'm up the creek

1315
01:33:23,782 --> 01:33:25,576
There's more than one fish in the sea

1316
01:33:25,659 --> 01:33:27,453
I'm not about to let it be

1317
01:33:27,536 --> 01:33:29,914
I know that I'm up the creek

1318
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:34,543
I'm up the creek

1319
01:33:34,627 --> 01:33:36,253
Without a paddle

1320
01:33:36,337 --> 01:33:38,088
I'm up the creek

1321
01:33:38,172 --> 01:33:41,091
But that don't matter at all

1322
01:33:42,509 --> 01:33:46,013
No matter at all

1323
01:33:47,306 --> 01:33:49,099
I'm up the creek

1324
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:50,893
Without a paddle

1325
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,895
I'm up the creek

1326
01:33:52,978 --> 01:33:56,023
I'm learning to paddle it all

1327
01:33:57,816 --> 01:34:01,862
Paddle it all

1328
01:34:04,782 --> 01:34:06,283
Hey! Hey!

1329
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:14,792
I'm up the creek

1330
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:22,049
I'm up the creek

1331
01:34:24,802 --> 01:34:29,431
I'm up the creek

1332
01:34:29,515 --> 01:34:32,393
Here I go!
You want to go?

1333
01:34:32,476 --> 01:34:36,772
I'm up the creek

1334
01:34:36,855 --> 01:34:39,733
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1335
01:34:39,817 --> 01:34:44,446
I'm up the creek

1336
01:34:47,157 --> 01:34:51,787
I'm up the creek

1337
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:55,457
Watch it! Wow!

1338
01:34:58,335 --> 01:35:02,214
The foreign legion's always there

1339
01:35:02,298 --> 01:35:04,842
I need a holiday

1340

That's the way

I know that time is on my side

I'm up the creek

I'm up the creek...
