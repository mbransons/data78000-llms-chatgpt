1
00:00:01,494 --> 00:00:04,414
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,266
(bell tolling)

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,167
(uptempo harmonizing music)

4
00:00:57,314 --> 00:01:02,701
(moaning)
(breathing heavily)

5
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,609
- Oh, that was so good.

6
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,789
Almost five years, just
keeps getting better,

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,727
you know, Carole?

8
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,427
Carole?

9
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,907
- I think we need
separate vacations.

10
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,469
- What?

11
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,033
You've been talking to
those girlfriends

12
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,527
of yours, haven't you?

13
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:38,709
- No.

14
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,655
I've got a mind of my own.

15
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,768
- Well, what about the ski trip?

16
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,923
I mean, we've been
planning it all semester.

17
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,773
- I know, but I really
think that separate

18
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,067
vacations would strengthen
our relationship.

19
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,812
- And just where we you
planning on spending

20
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,759
this separate vacation of yours?

21
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,914
- Fort Lauderdale.

22
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:59,146
- Fort Lauderdale?

23
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:02,552
(uptempo tech music)

24
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,573
- [Sandra] Hot rollers,
roomie dear, were not made

25
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,206
for re-heating pizza.

26
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,596
- You didn't like that, huh?

27
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,369
- [Sandra] I knew I shoulda
started packing last week.

28
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:31,123
- Sandra, we're going to
Fort Lauderdale for 10 days.

29
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:34,876
All you need is a bikini
and a diaphragm.

30
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,309
- I'm not going to
Fort Lauderdale.

31
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,325
I am going to Bermuda.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,098
Fort Lauderdale is a zoo.

33
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:43,600
It's full of millions of
guys who are just looking

34
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,755
for animal sex and debauchery.

35
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,293
- Exactly, that's why
we're going.

36
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:48,918
- Oh, grow up.

37
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:50,378
- You grow up.

38
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:53,819
Sandra, the four of us could
have a great time down there.

39
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:55,348
Besides, your cousin
Camden will be there.

40
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,086
You know what it would
mean to Jennie to meet him.

41
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,164
- Camden?

42
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,527
He's got the personality
of a cement block.

43
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,377
- Who cares as long as
it makes Jennie happy.

44
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:06,227
- Okay, I will drive down
there with you

45
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,043
and I will spend the weekend
with you, but that is all.

46
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:10,920
Then I am going to Bermuda.

47
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:13,908
And just to show you how nice
I am, you can use my car.

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,055
- Thanks.

49
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,480
- Which is probably
the only reason why you

50
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:18,427
want me to go in the
first place.

51
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,390
(classical music)

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,377
- Hey, how'd it go?

53
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,019
- [Carole] I told him and
he handled it very well.

54
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,452
- How well?
- He wanted to kill me.

55
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:44,773
- It's pretty well considering.

56
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,901
- So, it's Fort Lauderdale,
here we come.

57
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,291
- I don't think I can go.

58
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:50,125
- What?

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,133
And what about you?

60
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,662
- [Carole] Oh, I'm okay,
I'm going.

61
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,686
- Jennie, thinking has
nothing to do with it.

62
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,397
We're talking 10 days
in Sodom and Gomorrah.

63
00:03:58,432 --> 00:03:59,927
How can you back out now?

64
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,943
- Because I have a term
paper due in two weeks

65
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,680
and I haven't even started yet.

66
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:04,967
I'm not like you, Laurie.

67
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,808
You don't crack a book
and you make straight A's.

68
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,059
- Listen, darlin'.

69
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,945
If I can go spend three
days in Fort Lauderdale,

70
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,073
which is out of my element,
so can you.

71
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:16,993
Besides, how are you
gonna go meet my famous

72
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:21,442
cousin, Camden Roxbury, though
he be a weenie among men.

73
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:22,102
- Prick.

74
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,657
- Weenie.

75
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:23,978
- It's all the same.

76
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,724
- I don't get it. What's
this got to do with Camden?

77
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,166
- He is going to be in
Fort Lauderdale.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,084
He is doing a benefit
concert that

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,649
my Aunt Barbara is sponsoring.

80
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,422
So, as long as he's
gonna be there,

81
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,465
why don't you come meet him?

82
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,376
- Oh, I wanna go so bad,

83
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,018
I just have so much work to do.

84
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:44,033
- [Laurie] Bring your
books and you'll study.

85
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,605
- When you're not
lusting after Camden.

86
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,892
- [Laurie] You can do both.

87
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,281
- You're right, I can do both.

88
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:50,046
- So?

89
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,715
- We're outta here.

- [Sandra] What are you doing?

116
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,227
- S.A. major S.A.

117
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,512
- [Jennie] What's an S.A.?

118
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,181
- Stud alert, you nun.

119
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,753
I'm giving that guy a ride.

120
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,769
- [Sandra] Laurie, no,
not in my car.

121
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,341
That guy could be an
ax murderer.

122
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,661
- [Laurie] With that bod?

123
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,052
I'll chance it.

124
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,165
- [Sandra] Are you crazy?

125
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,702
Driving in reverse on a
major highway?

126
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,605
- [Laurie] Hi.

127
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,525
(all chattering)

128
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:25,062
- Thank you God.

129
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:26,592
Hi, I'm Scott Nash.

130
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:29,198
Could you move over
just a little?

131
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,241
So where you girls going?

132
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,353
- [Laurie] Lauderdale!

133
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:32,848
- [Scott] Great, so am I!

134
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,567
You know, this is a very
special place to me.

135
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:37,992
It's my sixth year in a
row down here.

136
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:39,000
- [Laurie] Really?

137
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,425
- Yeah, and the reason
I come to Lauderdale

138
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,267
every spring is to
make my fortune

139
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:44,804
so I can continue being
a part-time student.

140
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,055
- When did you drop
out of school?

141
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,237
- Oh, about two years ago.

142
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:49,323
And let me tell ya, it's
gonna be different this time.

143
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:50,330
'Cause I got a band.

144
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,581
- Where, in your duffle bag?

145
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:53,076
- Scott Nash and the Ramblers.

146
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:53,910
Ever heard of us?

147
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:54,849
- [Girls] No.

148
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:57,733
- No one has, but you will,
real soon.

149
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,742
- So, you're into music?

150
00:07:58,776 --> 00:07:59,784
- [Scott] Uh huh.

151
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,696
- [Carole] Jennie's a
music major.

152
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,260
- Oh really?

153
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,164
Like what?

154
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,894
New wave?

155
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:05,867
Punk?

156
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:06,771
Reggae?

157
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:07,674
- Strictly classical.

158
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,029
- Hey, let's find a gas station.

159
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,385
I have to go pee-pee.

160
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,184
- Tinkle.

161
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,227
- Leak.

162
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:13,131
- Piss.

163
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,034
- Oh, gross.

164
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,398
(laughing)

165
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,168
Where's the bathroom?

166
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,350
- [Attendant] 'Round back.

167
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,269
- [Sandra] Where?

168
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:31,656
- [Jennie] There.

169
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:32,595
- [Carole] Yeah.

170
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:35,549
- Oh, no door?

171
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:36,487
Guard it.

172
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:50,147
- [Carole] Hey you know,
that guy's kinda cute.

173
00:08:50,182 --> 00:08:52,546
He's got gorgeous eyes
and a nice smile.

174
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:54,735
Pretty intelligent, too.

175
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,821
- Yeah, and how
'bout those buns?

176

- [Carole] Oh my God,
it's a supermarket of sex.

191
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,409
- Check out those hamstrings!

192
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,155
Look at those legs.

193
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,510
- Oh stop it.

194
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,978
I'm gonna take that yellow
shirt and that blue biker

195
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,264
and the guys who's in it.

196
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,376
(chuckling)

197
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,280
- Sorry ladies.

198
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,427
This is where I get off.

199
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,443
My band awaits me.

200
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,598
Hey, thanks a lot for the ride.

201
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:27,710
Where you staying?

202
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,274
- Well, our plans are
kinda up in the air,

203
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:30,004
we actually haven't--

204
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,977
- Lauderdale Beach Hotel.

205
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,610
- Right, catch ya there.

206
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:33,897
- [Carole] So long, hotshot.

207
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,086
- [Sandra] It's been
very nice to meet you.

208
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,380
- Hey, you forgot your bag.

209
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,265
- Hey!

210
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,351
Hey, you finally made it, huh?

211
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:44,567
- [Scott] Hey Tony.

212
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:46,305
- Where the hell you been?

213
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,730
- [Scott] I got held up.

214
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,016
So, where are the guys?

215
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,789
- Oh, they're like,
scoping the beach, man.

216
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:53,048
Scrounging for food, crazy.

217
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:56,106
Listen, we got uh, we're
really hurtin', here.

218
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:59,582
We gotta eat and in order to
eat we need bucks, you know?

219
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,694
Bread?

220
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,119
- I told ya I'd get us a gig.

221
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:04,378
- Oh my God, look at
the talent on this girl.

222
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,464
I mean, fucking
incredible footage.

223
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,784
Spielberg would shit.

224
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,025
(uptempo music)

225
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,701
- [Carole] Hey you guys,
I'll go check us in.

226
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,266
- [Laurie] Okay.

227
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,599
- I am definitely out
of my element.

228
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,935
- I thought leopard
shawls were out.

229
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:27,840
(roaring)

230
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:28,882
- [Rappaport] Hello, doll.

231
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,037
- Hi, Carole Singer of Kenmore.

232
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:31,941
- Ah, here we are.

233
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,470
That's room 617.

234
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:36,007
The name's Rappaport.

235
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:37,884
Listen, dollface, if you
need anything,

236
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,630
extra soap, more towels,
a nude hot oil massage,

237
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,985
feel free to call me.

238
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,593
- [Carole] Gimme that key,
creep.

239
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:45,982
- [Sandra] No boutique.

240
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,276
No beauty parlor.

241
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:50,744
- [Jennie] We'll find you
a beauty parlor.

242
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,733
- Yeah, well I wish I were
in Bermuda now.

243
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,556
(chattering)

244
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:01,171
- It's down there on the left.

245
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:02,249
- Oh, dammit.

246
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,848
Yellow ice again.

247
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,636
- [Carole] I got the key,
I got the key.

248
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:08,609
Hold on.

249
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,512
- Hi y'all.

250
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,633
I'm from Texas A & M.

251
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,545
- Looks more like Texas S & M.

252
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,368
- [Carole] I think I'm
missing a suitcase.

253
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,280
- [Laurie] Could be in
the trunk of the car.

254
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,982
- [All] Oh my God.

255
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,980
(mumbling)

256
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:27,482
(crashing)

257
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:30,610
- Now I really am out
of my element.

258
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,140
- We can't stay here.

259
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,808
- [Laurie] I love
cheap grandeur.

260
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:34,607
- You would.

261
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,292
- [Jennie] How much is
this room costing us?

262
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,239
- [Carole] I don't know.

263
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,671
- Oh, we've got to have
this bathroom condemned.

264
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,409
- [Sandra] Why don't we
call that guy at the desk

265
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,452
and get some Lysol?

266
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:48,024
He's probably drinking
it as we speak.

267
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,048
- There's no hot water.

268
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:53,411
In fact, there's no
water at all.

269
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:56,087
- [Carole] That bug was
bigger than my foot.

270
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,093
- Operator I would like a
number in Fort Lauderdale,

271
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,796
the Roxbury residence.

272
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,097
- [Carole] This has gotta go.

273
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:08,322
- [Sandra] Just a minute,
operator.

274
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:09,434
- Perfect.

275
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:15,933
What have you got in there?

276
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,756
- One bottle of 151 proof
rum, birth control pills,

277
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,920
some Midol, my father's
American Express card,

278
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:25,179
king size bottle of
Alka-Seltzer, too.

279
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,507
One sexy black teddy.

280
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:31,435
A lid of grass and a quarter,
just in case

281
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,860
I have to call home.

282
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,772
I think that oughta get
me through the night.

283
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:37,378
- That could get me through
the rest of my life.

284
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:40,228
(harpsichord music)

285
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,740
- Ah, let's see, I'm
wearing the black and white.

286
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,165
You're wearing the pink.

287
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,423
We'll take that one.

288
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,083
- Perfect.

289
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,421
That'll impress 'em at
the Miami Airport.

290
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,843
- Hector, wash the car,
not your hair.

291
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,580
- Relax, Barbara.

292
00:13:58,615 --> 00:13:59,310
- Relax?

293
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:00,075
If I'm late I'll kill myself.

294
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:01,465
My son needs me.

295
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,864
- Darling, he hasn't needed
you since he was six years old

296
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,296
when he won the International
Chopin Competition.

297
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:06,852
- At Juilliard.

298
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:11,475
- [Maggie] Besides, he's
wealthier, smarter and far more

299
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,282
pretentious than we are.

300
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,716
- [Barbara] No one's more
pretentious than we are.

301
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,862
- [Maggie] Wanna bet?

302
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,562
- Barbara Roxbury please.

303
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:24,892
When?

304
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:30,487
Oh, can you tell her
her niece Sandra called?

305
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:37,265
Sandra and I'm staying at
the Lauderdale Beach Hotel.

306
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:38,725
Si.

307
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:41,714
Ooh, what's that?

308
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,660
- My buddy, Dave.

309
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:46,267
He was a gift and he'll
be our bodyguard.

310
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,144
- Laurie, it is way too
crowded in here.

311
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,125
He's gonna have to
sleep in the tub.

312
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,767
- Come on, Dave, time for bath.

313
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,095
- [Jennie] Laurie, you're weird.

314
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,702
- She's on vacation scrubbing
other people's toilets

315
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:58,745
and I'm weird?

316
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,274
Let's get naked, Dave.

317
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:01,699
(chuckling)

318
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,861
(harpsichord music)

319
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,169
- [Man] Hello, Mrs. Roxbury.

320
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,385
- Hi, thanks.

321
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,053
Oh God, we've missed him.

322
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:16,783
I knew it.

323
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:17,930
He's gonna be furious.

324
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:22,205
Camden!

325
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,978
Camden, darling, it's Mother!

326
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:24,882
- And Maggie.

327
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,376
- I know, I know.

328
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,801
Are you sure there's no press?

329
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:28,914
- Didn't I promise you?

330
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:30,895
Sometimes I think you
don't trust me.

331
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:34,718
- Mother, you're a
picture postcard.

332
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:37,325
And Maggie, you are simply
younger than springtime.

333
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,653
- Oh, this boy's truly divine!

334
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:41,670
Oh come on, Camden.

335
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,824
Give your old mom a
big smack on the chops!

336
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,292
(smooching)
(chuckling)

337
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:50,394
- Camden, you look a
little tired.

338
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:53,104
How old is this French actress
that you've been dating?

339
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,286
The one we read about in People?

340
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,232
The one you didn't
mention to me?

341
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,971
- Mother, that's my affair.

342
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,569
- Don't you think you'd
be more comfortable

343
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:00,611
with people your own age?

344
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,142
- Mother, let's set
things straight.

345
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,053
I'm here to do the concert
for you and Maggie,

346
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:06,833
as I promised, but by
weekend I'll be going back

347
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:09,335
to San Tropez for a little
peace and quiet

348
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:10,587
and a very long rest.

349
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,630
- Oh, but darling.

350
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,124
You'll get plenty of
peace right here

351
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,480
during Easter vacation.

352
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:19,033
♪ It's gonna be paradise

353
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:23,204
♪ Simply heaven

354
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,471
♪ I'll do anything you like

355
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:30,468

(cheering)

359
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:51,079
(screaming)
(splashing)

360
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,066
- [Woman] Oh my God.

361
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,220
(chattering)

362
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:02,514
- [Laurie] Hey guys, you know
what I wanna do down here?

363
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:03,556
- [Carole] What?

364
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:06,129
- I wanna meet some
total bonehead

365
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:08,735
with the most gorgeous
bod you've ever seen,

366
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,237
whose mind has turned
to guacamole.

367
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:13,289
I'm talking Conan the Barbarian.

368
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,505
(giggling)

369
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,417
I'm gonna wrap myself
around him for one night

370
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:19,684
of unbelievable raw, primal sex.

371
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,673
- She's great when she
holds back like this.

372
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:23,646
- [Mr. Bullhorn] Attention!

373
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,106
Attention Paul Newman.

374
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,774
Paging Mr. Paul Newman.

375
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:27,678
- Paul Newman?

376
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:28,581
Where?

377
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:30,494
(cheering)
(applauding)

378
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,586
Another victim of Mr. Bullhorn!

379
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,950
(cheering)

380
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:39,356
- New arrivals in town, hmm?

381
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,921
Better be careful with
this Florida sun.

382
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:43,319
It's a lot stronger than
you're used to.

383
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,848
- Really?

384
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:48,289
I guess you'd know all
about sunburns and things,

385
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,966
being from Fort
Lauderdale and all.

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,321
- I'm dark complected.

387
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:53,433
I don't burn.

388
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:56,352
- Well, darlin', you just
be extra careful, okay?

389
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:57,291
- Uh huh.

390
00:17:58,855 --> 00:17:59,724
- He's cute.

391
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,287
- And he's real sexy.

392
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:03,512
- Police officers are not sexy.

393
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:06,224
They're civil servants
and you don't date them.

394
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:09,143
You date bankers and lawyers--

395
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:09,769
- Lawyers.

396
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:10,395
- [Sandra] And doctors--

397
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:11,020
- Doctors.

398
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:12,236
- There she goes again.

399
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,801
- Well, if I intend to
leave here looking like

400
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:17,624
Diana Ross, I'd better start
catching some serious rays.

401
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,254
(uptempo rock music)

402
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,838
Oh my God, it's Conan.

403
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,165
- Oh Jennie, be careful,
be careful.

404
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,215
(wincing)

405
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,092
(knocking)

406
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,656
- [Laurie] Hey if you're
hot, young and hung,

407
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:57,977
you can come in.

408
00:18:59,088 --> 00:18:59,888
- What'd she just say?

409
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:00,792
- [Sandra] Laurie, who's that?

410
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:01,974
- [Scott] Hi, I forgot my bag.

411
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,259
- [Laurie] Hi, well,
it's right over there.

412
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,746
Come on in.

413
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:04,928
- Well, thanks.

414
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,527
Hey guys, come on in.
- [Sandra] What are you doing?

415
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,778
- [Jennie] What, are
you kidding me?

416
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,106
- I want to introduce you to
my four fabulous musicians.

417
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:12,435
That's Tony on the
bass and camera.

418
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,347
That's Jude and Ray
on the guitars.

419
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:16,016
And that's Jeff on the drums.

420
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,746
(chattering)

421
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,282
- This is Laurie, Sandra...

422
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:20,186
- Carole.

423
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,055
- [Scott] Carole.

424
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,576
- Thank you.

425
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,688
- And Jennie.

426
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,496
- [Tony] Ray, we're
losing light here.

427
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,712
- I'm gonna call the front desk.

428
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,755
- What are you doing?

429
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,216
- I'm shooting a documentary.

430
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,875
- On what?

431
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,535
Half nude college girls?

432
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:30,335
Get outta here.

433
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,621
- He thinks he's Fellini.

434
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,124
Anyway, you're all invited
tonight to City Limits

435
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,897
where we will be appearing live.

436
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:36,800
- [Jennie] Okay, look, bye.

437
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,912
- 9:30.

438
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:40,554
(chattering)

439
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,396
- Bye.

440
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,438
(phone ringing)

441
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,551
- [Scott] Now, don't forget,
9:30.

442
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,358
- [Tony] Bye.

443
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,208
(phone ringing)

444
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:50,633
- [Jennie] Laurie, would
you come back here?

445
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:51,537
- [Laurie] No.

446
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:53,171
- [Sandra] Hello Aunt Barbara.

447
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,109
- [Jennie] I don't believe...

448
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:56,820
- Sandra, what a surprise.

449
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,113
I thought you'd be in Bermuda.

450
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,991
So, where are you staying?

451
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,919
Lauderdale Beach Hotel
on the strip.

452
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,413
How divine.

453
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,525
With whom?

454
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,827
Oh, your three roommates.

455
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,086
Well, yes he is here, the
little genius.

456
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,380
I know he'd love to meet them.

457
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,909
Where?

458
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:18,196
The City Limits.

459
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,281
How vivid.

460
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:23,235
No, no, it's perfect, what time,
9:30?

461
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,947
Great, right, bye.

462
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,884
- Bye bye.

463
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,519
Done.

464
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:31,125
We are meeting my Aunt
Barbara and my cousin Camden

465
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,454
tonight at that club
where Scott's playin'.

466
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:34,601
- I don't believe it.

467
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,922
(giggling)

468
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,763
What's he really like?

469
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,293
- Let me put it to you this way.

470
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:42,248
To Camden Roxbury, a
one night stand

471
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,159
is an evening with
the Boston Pops.

472
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,793
(laughing)
(knocking)

473
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,218
- I got it.

474
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:49,790
- [Carole] Careful, might be
that creep from downstairs.

475
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:52,292
- [Scott] Hi.

476
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,230
- [Jennie] Hi.

477
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,829
- I almost forgot, for you.

478
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,463
- Oh, thank you.

479
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:57,575
You really shouldn't have.

480
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,800
I mean, this must have
been expensive.

481
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:02,198
- Some things are more
important than money.

482
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,109
- Thanks.

483
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,130
It's Beethoven.

484
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,417
- How nice.

485
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:15,927
- [Jennie] From the Fort
Lauderdale Public Library.

486
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,004
Oh, gimme a break.

487
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,360
(laughing)

488
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:19,437
- Hey look.

489
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,723
Come on, Toby, have a heart.

490
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,982
- My heart's in the cash
register right over there.

491
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,963
- Well just put Scott Nash
and the Ramblers to work

492
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,293
and you'll have cash in
the register over there.

493
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,822
Come on, just let us
perform tonight

494
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,559
and you'll see that
Nash means cash.

495
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:34,174
Toby look, how do you
expect me to go out there

496
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,155
and tell the guys that
you can't use 'em?

497
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,302
I thought we had a deal.

498
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,206
- Sorry my man.

499
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:39,005
I don't need you.

500
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,118
I got a band.

501
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,099
- I'll tell you what,
we'll work cheap.

502
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,490
In fact, we'll work free.

503
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:47,869
- What I need is busboys,
dependable, responsible busboys.

504
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:48,772
- Busboys?

505
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,301
We're musicians.

506
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,456
- [Gary] Chip, we've
been driving up and down

507
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,542
this strip for six hours.

508
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:56,905
- [Chip] And we'll keep
driving for six more hours

509
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,087
until we find her.

510
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,659
- It's a hundred
degrees down here.

511
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,127
I think we brought the
wrong clothes.

512
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:04,274
- Well, we're not
here for sunning.

513
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:05,559
We're here for spying.

514
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,472
- How do you expect to find her?

515
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,766
There's over two million
college kids roaming around.

516
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,025
- She's down here,
I'll find her.

517
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,666
I've given Carole some of
the best years of my life,

518
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,891
and I swear, if I find
her with some other guy,

519
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:18,454
I want those years back.

You can say shit.

530

and that's it.

Mrs. Roxbury the third.

533
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,396
- He's the third,
I'm the second.

534
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,926
Oh, there they are.

535
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,116
Come on, Maggie, Camden.

536

Darling.

537
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,201

539
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:02,735
Nice to see you.

540
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,593
This is my friend Carole
and Laurie and Jennie.

541
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:08,366
My Aunt Barbara and Maggie.

542
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,485
Come on, sit down.

543
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,668
Hi Camden.

544
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:14,830
- Very nice to see you in
your real eminence, Sandra.

545
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,499
- This place wasn't
exactly my idea, cousin.

546
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,036
We just came to see a
friend of Jennie's perform.

547
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:19,801
- Hi ladies.

548
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:21,017
May I take your order?

549
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:23,346
- Scott, I thought you guys
were playing here tonight.

550
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,196
- So did I, but I think we're
gonna play in a couple nights.

551
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,933
You know, I'm really
glad you could make it.

552
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,394
And to show you my appreciation,

553
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:30,645
the first round of
drinks is on me.

554
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:32,104
So what'll it be?

555
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,615
- I think we'd like to start
with a magnum of Dom Perignon,

556
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,831
be just fine.

557
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,438
- How 'bout a round of beers?

558
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:41,871
- Is he a friend of yours?

559
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,019
- Well, not exactly.

560
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:45,555
He's just a guy we picked
up hitchhiking.

561
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,919
He's someone we just met.

562
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,125
- Waiter, I think we'll
just have the champagne

563
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,531
and you can put it on
my Mastercard.

564
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,504
- Yes, sir.

(uptempo rock music)

566
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,669
- This job is worse
than the job I had

567
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,554
in a pet cemetery in Cleveland.

568
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,292
- Do me a favor, okay?

569
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,655
- Oh sure, anything for a
pal who got me into this

570
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,080
in the first place.

571
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:19,478
- Just take this order
over to that table.

572
00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:20,382
- [Tony] What's the matter?

573
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,321
Tray too heavy for ya?

574
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,040
- No, I just may drop
it on his head.

575
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:26,812
- Hey guys.

576
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:31,192
For someone with a
personality of a cement block,

577
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:32,791
I think Camden's kinda cute.

578
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,605
- I think you better
get your eyes examined

579
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,586
for glasses when we get
back to school.

580
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:40,958
- Getting back to your
(mumbling) interpretation

581
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:42,557
of my third piano concerto.

582
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:43,912
- No, your second.

583
00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:47,075
Your third was much more
moderish in mood.

584
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,438
- I actually think she
understands his music.

585
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:51,628
God knows I don't,
but I love it.

586
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:53,088
- You know, Jennie, I'd
very much like

587
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:55,660
to continue our conversation
but this atmosphere

588
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,406
is certainly not the
most conducive.

589
00:24:58,441 --> 00:24:59,553
I'd like to see you again.

590
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:05,323
Would you like to be my guest
at the concert Saturday night?

591
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:06,330
- I'd love to.

592
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,763

care of everything.

00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,029

651
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:38,079

656
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:52,295
- At least one of us is
having some fun.

657
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:58,169
- Aw, mas tequila.

658
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:59,420
Mas tequila Mary.

659
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:02,722
I am tequila Mary.

(giggling)

661
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:05,850
- We should get her
drunk more often.

662
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:06,928
She's funny.

663
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,454
I'll be back in a minute.

664
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,818
- Can I have scotch
on the rocks?

665
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,745
Ooh, Oberlin, huh?

666
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,066
- That's right.

and the sheep are nervous.

668
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,480
Can we get acquainted?

669
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:25,453
- Sure.

670
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:26,600

671
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,467

- Drink madam?

673
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,024
- Listen, I want to apologize
for what I said earlier.

674
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,874
I really didn't mean for
it to come out that way.

675
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,821
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

676
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,872
It was rude and I'm sorry, okay?

677
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,138

walk you home.

doesn't close 'til four a.m.

680
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,368
But I'll buy you
breakfast on the beach.

681
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:00,627
- Alright.

682
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,223
- Ooh, I wanna buy his butt.

683
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,177
Buy somebody's butt.

684
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:13,557
- Ooh.

685
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:17,971
Yeah. Hey, if we keep this
up much longer,

686
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,848
we'll have to get married.

let's get shitfaced with a
little dignity?

689
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,067
- Yeah.

hang on, I'll be there.

a drunk and disorderly,

728

I'm really glad you could stay.

It was actually kinda fun.

745

You know, being my first
night in Fort Lauderdale,

It's so peaceful.

- Yeah, it's really beautiful.

750
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,341
- Now how about seriously
discussing the possibility of

751
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,626
having some real fun?

752
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:21,955
- Like what?

753
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:24,667

and the talk.

doesn't overreact.

(cheering)

816
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:30,720
- Hello.

817
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:31,380
- Oh, forget it.

818
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,180
- Oh come on, Carole.

819
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:33,466
You'll be great.

820
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,960
- [Scott] Jeff, you're in the
Hot Bod contest with Carole.

821
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,385
I want ya firm and I
want ya pumped.

822
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,463
- [Jeff] Right, buddy.

823
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:38,714
- Why does it have to be me?

824
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:39,513
I mean, that's really
humiliating.

825
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,764
- No, it's not.

826
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,336
You'll be wonderful and you
had years of dance classes.

827
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:44,484
- Jennie, that was ballet.

828
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,152
I don't think the
Hot Bod contest

829
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:48,099
is looking for a new Giselle.

830
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,488
- [Jennie] Just remember
you're doing it

831
00:37:49,524 --> 00:37:50,949
for Sandra and Laurie.

832
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:53,451
- [Both] Sandra and Laurie.

833
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:56,093
- [All Three] Sandra and Laurie.

834
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:58,074
- [Both] Sandra and Laurie.

835
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:01,062
- [Camden] An afternoon cocktail
party for Sandra tomorrow?

836
00:38:01,098 --> 00:38:02,419
It's out of the question.

837
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,643
- [Barbara] Oh, you can't
be that rude to your cousin

838
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:06,763
and her friends, besides,
I invited that darling

839
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:08,153
debutante Christina Lawson.

840
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,161
You'll love her.

841
00:38:09,196 --> 00:38:11,768
- Oh Mother, please quit
trying to fix me up.

842
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,757
But I suppose you are right
about Sandra and her roommates,

843
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,426
especially that girl, Jennie.

844
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,781
I think that's what
her name was.

845
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:20,944
- Jennie, she's the one that
was so fascinated by you.

846
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:22,091
- She was not.

847
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:24,107
She just happens to be
very bright and well-versed

848
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:27,722
in a subject in which we share
a common interest, my music.

849
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:30,016
- Perhaps you'd like
to invite her yourself?

850
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,239
- I suppose that would be
the proper thing to do.

851
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,664
Do you know what hotel
they're staying at?

852
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,542
- Of course, it's the
Lauderdale Beach Hotel.

853
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:36,724
I already called.

854
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:38,357
They aren't in, but
they did leave a message

855
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:41,589
they're at someplace
called Bootleggers.

856
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:42,980
- Mother, you're
certainly on top of things

857
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:43,987
at all times, aren't you?

(catcalling)

974
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:21,686
- [Jennie] There they are.

975
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:22,555
- [Sandra] Jenny!

976
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:23,250
- [Laurie] Hey!

977
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:23,910
- [Jennie] Are you alright?

978
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:24,884
(mumbling)

979
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:26,239
- Listen, we got good
news and bad news.

980
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:27,664
The good news is that
Carole and Jeff won

981
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,931
second place in this
Hot Bod contest, $150.

982
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,600
- The bad news is, we
only have enough money

983
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:33,851
to get one of you out.

984
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:34,581
- What?

985
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:35,624
- What are we gonna do?

986
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:37,083
- We'll flip a coin.

987
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,300
Somebody call it.

988
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:39,238
- Heads.

989
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,116
- Tails.

990
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,019
- Oh!

991
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,201
- [Man] Open four.

992
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,727
- We'll be back, okay?

993
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:49,457
- [Sandra] Okay.

994
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:50,570
- [Jennie] Don't worry.

995
00:44:54,253 --> 00:44:56,374
- [Laurie] Should we call
her Aunt Martha?

996
00:44:56,408 --> 00:44:57,833
- [Jennie] Are you crazy?

997
00:45:00,336 --> 00:45:03,291
- Looks like your friends
left you kinda high and dry.

998
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:05,410
- What friends?

999
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:06,905
I don't have any friends.

1000
00:45:07,878 --> 00:45:08,991
This is it.

1001
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:11,701
Alone, behind bars.

1002
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,530
How did I fall so low so fast?

1003
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,118
- I think you've done
enough time, lady.

1004
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:26,160
Open four.

1005
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,294
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

1006
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:37,422
- Yeah okay, I'd like that.

1007
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,496
(clanging)

1008
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,164
You're Officer Brasso, right?

1009
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,972
- [Ernie] You can call me Ernie.

1010
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:47,883
- [Sandra] Oh, thanks.

1011
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,378
Listen, could I call my friends?

1012
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:51,498
- [Ernie] That's a good idea.

1013
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,097
Coffee may turn into dinner.

1014
00:45:54,313 --> 00:45:57,511
(uptempo rock music)

1015
00:46:07,174 --> 00:46:11,205
♪ The beat goes on and on

1016
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:15,376
♪ Night is almost gone

1017
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:19,164

1018
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,509
♪ Before the night is through

1019
00:46:23,544 --> 00:46:27,576

00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,747
♪ Would make me feel alright

1021
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:36,474
- [Laurie] Hey guys,
whaddya think?

1022
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:38,594
Is this a little too trashy?

1023
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,088
- [Carole] On you, never.

1024
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:43,877
- I still can't get
over him saying we have

1025
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:45,684
an appointment tomorrow night.

1026
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,797
I love it.

1027
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,186
It's not a date, it's
an appointment.

1028
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:52,357
I've got a scheduled
rendezvous with Conan.

1029
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:55,381
- God, Laurie, can't you
think of anything else?

1030
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,328
- Hey, where have you been?

1031
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:00,908
- Oh, I've been to the
moon, Jupiter, Camelot

1032
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,881
even Shangri la.

1033
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,827
- God, I shoulda stayed in jail.

1034
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:08,520
- Ladies, I'm in love.

1035
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:09,979
- Are you kidding?

1036
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:11,718
What about Bermuda?

1037
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:12,899
- Oh, screw Bermuda.

1038
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,984
I'm not gonna leave
this paradise.

1039
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:16,583
- [Laurie] God, jail
changed her.

1040
00:47:16,618 --> 00:47:17,626
- For the better.

1041
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,155
- Well, tell us all about it.

1042
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:20,198
Who is he?

1043
00:47:20,232 --> 00:47:21,275
- I don't know.

1044
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,187
Maybe he'll be the great
love of my life,

1045
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:24,647
like Chip is to Carole.

1046
00:47:24,681 --> 00:47:27,010
- Chip is no longer the
great love of my life.

1047
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,401
We're estranged.

1048
00:47:28,435 --> 00:47:30,069
- What can I say?

1049
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:32,884
He's strong,

1050
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:33,961
attentive,

1051
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:36,637
committed.

1052
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:38,688
- What else?

1053
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:42,338
- Dedicated, thoughtful.

1054
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,458
- Who you datin' ?

1055
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:45,431
Clark Kent?

1056
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:47,170
(giggling)

1057
00:47:47,204 --> 00:47:49,637
- There's just one little
problem but it's nothing.

1058
00:47:49,672 --> 00:47:51,375
I think we can overcome it.

1059
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,244
- He's gay.

1060
00:47:52,278 --> 00:47:53,426
- No, married.

1061
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,329
- Same thing.

1062
00:47:54,363 --> 00:47:55,406
- Oh no!

1063
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:56,658
- Yeah, I know.

1064
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:57,909
I never thought of
myself as the kind

1065
00:47:57,944 --> 00:47:59,925
that goes around wrecking homes,

1066
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:02,705
but I guess you gotta
start somewhere, right?

1067
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:04,166
(mumbling)

1068
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,147
Actually, they're separated.

1069
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:07,468
- That's what they all say.

1070
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:09,275
Has he got any kids?

1071
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:11,082
- Yeah, a boy.

1072
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:12,437
Imagine me with a son?

1073
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,627
- Sandra, just go for it.

1074
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:17,443
- Laurie, this isn't
just a fling.

1075
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,868
I'm a little scared.

1076
00:48:20,014 --> 00:48:23,073
What if he just wants
to go to bed with me?

1077
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,854
What if he's just
trying to use me?

1078
00:48:25,888 --> 00:48:28,773
- Just use him back,
it's very simple.

1079
00:48:28,808 --> 00:48:29,921
- No, what if I get--

1080
00:48:29,955 --> 00:48:31,172
- Oh, would you stop
with the what-ifs?

1081
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:33,083
You're obviously crazy
about this guy.

1082
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,404
Now, you should just
go be with him

1083
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,107
and have a good time.

1084
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,713
You never know until you try.

1085
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,070
- [Sandra] Oh yeah, yeah.

1086
00:48:40,104 --> 00:48:41,285
I guess.

1087
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,920
Maybe I will.

1088
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,553
- You know what I'd kill
for right now?

1089
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:45,596
- What?

1090
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,743
- Pizza.

1091
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:49,245
(laughing)

1092
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:53,659
(thudding)

1093
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,282
Room service'll get that.

1094
00:48:58,317 --> 00:49:01,271
Nurse, she's out of
her room again.

1095
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:02,939
(laughing)

1096
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:06,242
- I'm starting to fantasize
about Ernie already.

1097
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,423
- Uh oh.

1098
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:10,169
- I hope he's the one
that's gonna make me oh!

1099
00:49:11,037 --> 00:49:12,532
- Make you what?

1100
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:13,436
- Cough it up.

1101
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,339
- Come!

1102
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:18,232
(shrieking)
(laughing)

1103
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:19,483
- Now what a minute,
wait a minute.

1104
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:20,804
You gonna tell me
nothing happened

1105
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:24,210
with you and Peter or
Brad behind ivy walls?

1106
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:25,497
- Nope, not once.

1107
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:28,973
I've only had six experiences

1108
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:33,074
and that counts as two times
where I just kinda shook.

1109
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:34,047
(laughing)

1110
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:35,402
While everyone else was
playing doctor,

1111
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:37,419
I was trying to figure
out how to marry one.

1112
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:41,554
- [Laurie] I think it's
time for a little education.

1113
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:43,848
- [Jennie] What are
you gonna do?

1114
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:45,238
- Put on something romantic.

1115
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,421
- [Carole] What are you doing?

1116
00:49:46,455 --> 00:49:49,479
- [Jennie] You don't like this?
(laughing)

1117
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:50,522
- [Laurie] Music!

1118
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,746
Dave, are you done
with your bath?

1119
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,264
- Nurse, she's out of her room.

1120
00:49:57,299 --> 00:49:59,558
- [Laurie] Here he comes,
squeaky clean.

1121
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,069
- [Sandra] Is this
romantic enough?

1122
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,294
Okay.

1123
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:08,491
- You've already begun
to fantasize,

1124
00:50:08,526 --> 00:50:11,028
so fantasize this as Ernie.

1125
00:50:12,036 --> 00:50:15,060
(laughing)

1126
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,562
- Ernie is not inflatable.

1127
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,682
- He better be, else I'd
break the date with him.

1128
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:21,907
(laughing)

1129
00:50:23,124 --> 00:50:26,773
- You're both feeling those
strong animal impulses,

1130
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,604
so you start out with
a simple kiss.

1131
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:32,056
- What?

1132
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:33,273
- Oh, Laurie.

1133
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:35,775
- He doesn't have herpes,
just kiss him okay?

1134
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,818
Relax.

1135
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:41,232
Nothing'll ever happen
if you're tense, okay?

1136
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,135
- Okay.

1137
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,318
- [Laurie] Okay.

1138
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:45,229
Now, kiss him.

1139
00:50:45,263 --> 00:50:49,712
- [Carole] Oh God.

1140
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:50,999
- Not like he's your
grandfather.

1141
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:52,180
Just kiss him.

1142
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,405
- [Jennie] Where's my camera?

1143
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:55,378
(laughing)

1144
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:57,255
- [Laurie] Come on.

1145
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:59,723
- [Jennie] Okay, now give
me a great shot.

1146
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,322
- Go for it girl.

1147
00:51:01,356 --> 00:51:03,754
(moaning)

1148
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,396
Feel anything yet?

1149
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,203
- Not a thing.

1150
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:10,775
- Maybe you should dig
your nails into his back.

1151
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,061
- Only if you really feel it

1152
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:14,008
because you can't fake it.

1153
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:15,259
- Fake it?

1154
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:18,596
The woman is screwing
a hefty bag (mumbling).

1155
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,743
(laughing)

1156
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,342
Oh my God!

1157
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:23,183
- Well, start again.

1158
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:24,087
- Okay.

1159
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:24,991
- With foreplay, alright?

1160
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:26,173
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.

1161
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:27,111
- Body kissing.

1162
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:27,842
- [Carole] Body kissing?

1163
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,023
- Now, start on the mouth, okay?

1164
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:32,012
- [Carole] Just pretend
he's Richard Gere.

1165
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,341
(laughing)

1166
00:51:36,634 --> 00:51:37,677
- Here we go.

1167
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:41,883
- Okay, good, now linger
there a minute

1168
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:44,211
and then slowly move
to the cheek.

1169
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:46,957
And it tastes like a
combination of suntan oil--

1170
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:48,035
- And rubber.

1171
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,155
(laughing)

1172
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:54,048
- Now, you slowly move off
the cheek, across his chin

1173
00:51:54,082 --> 00:51:57,836
and your mouth slides
down his neck.

1174
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:00,582
Tastes like apricot brandy.

1175
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,258
- I'm suffocating.

1176
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:06,004
- Okay, you can hardly
stand it now.

1177
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:08,159
As your tongue comes
down his neck,

1178
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:10,766
to his heaving chest...

1179
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:13,477
(laughing)

1180
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:18,517
you place your lips on either
one of his nipples, okay?

1181
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:19,385
- Nipples?

1182
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:20,846
Oh gross, Laurie, come on.

1183
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,391
(laughing)

1184
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:25,329
- Now,

1185
00:52:26,824 --> 00:52:29,256
you kiss it, and then,

1186
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:31,169
feeling very reckless,

1187
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:33,462
you gently, gently,

1188
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:37,216
but firmly bite it.

1189
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:40,831
(popping)
(shrieking)

1190
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,089
(hissing)

1191
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:46,496
- She killed him.

1192
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:49,277
(somber music)

1193
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:03,944
- [Laurie] Goodnight,
sweet prince.

1194
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:06,829
(waves lapping)

1195
00:53:11,278 --> 00:53:16,144
- [Sandra] Laurie, I'm truly,
truly sorry.

1196
00:53:16,178 --> 00:53:20,280
- [Laurie] It's okay, hon, as
long as you climax with Ernie.

1197
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:24,589
Dave would have
wanted it that way.

1198
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,429
(giggling)

1199
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:33,766
(uptempo pop music)

1200
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:45,444
(engine rumbling)

1201
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:57,296
(light classical music)

1202
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,386
- [Maggie] Oh, I see the
Cabots are here.

1203
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:06,542
Charlie had time for
these little wing-dings.

1204
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,835
- Oh, he'll do anything I
ask ever since

1205
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,337
I found out about the
affair with the Jeep driver.

1206
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,972
- Ooh, I bet you didn't
waste a second

1207
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:14,501
in letting him know.

1208
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:17,559
- You know how I hate
keeping secrets.

1209
00:54:17,594 --> 00:54:18,706
- [Maggie] Isn't that
Carola Minola?

1210
00:54:20,305 --> 00:54:21,800
- [Barbara] It certainly is.

1211
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:22,911
- [Maggie] I thought
she was dead.

1212
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:24,336
- That never stopped
her from coming to one

1213
00:54:24,372 --> 00:54:26,283
of my parties before.

1214
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:28,543
- And on the patio,
Mother in 1983 built

1215
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,794
the cascades over the pool.

1216
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:30,975
Oh, here she is right now.

1217
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,053
Hello.

1218
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:35,077
(chattering)

1219
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:36,050
- Thought you got lost, hi.

1220
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:37,023
- Hi, girls.

1221
00:54:38,413 --> 00:54:40,603
- Aunt Barbara, I would
like you to meet my escort,

1222
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:42,897
police officer Ernest Grasso.

1223
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,538
- Where did you two meet?

1224
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,651
- In jail.

1225
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,057
- Why don't you say hello
to Christina Lawson,

1226
00:54:50,092 --> 00:54:51,760
our favorite debutante.

1227
00:54:51,795 --> 00:54:52,872
(chattering)

1228
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:55,792
- Carole, where is that
adorable Laurie?

1229
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:56,904
- She couldn't make it.

1230
00:54:56,938 --> 00:54:59,163
- Yeah, she had a
previous appointment.

1231
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:10,563
(soft pop music)

1232
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,831
(doorbell ringing)

1233
00:55:18,488 --> 00:55:19,565
- [Conan] You're late.

1234
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,381
- [Laurie] Just five minutes.

1235
00:55:28,185 --> 00:55:29,888
- [Conan] Time is money.

1236
00:55:29,923 --> 00:55:30,827
- Right.

1237
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:38,160
Satin sheets,

1238
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:40,142
nice.

1239
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:43,548
- [Conan] They'd look
nicer with you in 'em.

1240
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:44,834
- That could be arranged.

1241
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:53,454
You don't waste any time,
do you?

1242
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:55,608
- I told you, time is money.

1243
00:55:57,694 --> 00:56:00,057
- That's the second time
you've said that.

1244
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:03,533
What's that all about?

1245
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,132
- I'm a businessman, lady.

1246
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,356
You wanna play, you gotta pay.

1247
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:12,292
- You expect me to pay you?

1248
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:17,019
What are you, on drugs
or something?

1249
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:19,104
You son of a bitch.

1250
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:20,807
Pay for it my ass.

1251
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,350
Okay, get undressed.

1252
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,357
- What?

1253
00:56:29,393 --> 00:56:30,261
- You heard me.

1254
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:31,790
If I'm buying a piece of meat,

1255
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:34,710
I sure as hell intend to see
what's under the wrapper.

1256
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:37,526
Come on, come on, time is
money remember?

1257
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:43,747
That too.

1258
00:56:51,394 --> 00:56:52,819
Yeah.

1259
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:54,556
So, where's the rest of it?

1260
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,995
I'll see you in small
claims court.

1261
00:57:09,328 --> 00:57:12,386
- You must have had a wonderful
childhood growing up here.

1262
00:57:13,743 --> 00:57:14,889
- I wouldn't know.

1263
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:19,303
I was on tour when my childhood
was supposed to happen.

1264
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:22,119
- [Barbara] Oh, they
look so happy together.

1265
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,170
God, I hope she's from
a good family.

1266
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:25,559
- Why? You weren't.

1267
00:57:26,602 --> 00:57:29,661
(engine rumbling)

1268
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,615
(dramatic music)

1269
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:46,067
- [Mr. Bullhorn] Come on
party animals, this way.

1270
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:48,221
333 Ocean Vista Drive.

1271
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,801
Come on, party animals.

1272
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,605

1284
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:21,648
- Holy shit.

1285
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:26,479
- [Camden] That noise,
those people, those boats.

1286
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,634
Mother has really done
it this time.

1287
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:33,604
The only thing that can save
us is some nice champagne.

1288
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:35,063
- Oh, sounds great.

1289
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,895
So, how's the new piece
coming along?

1290
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,745
- I haven't really figured
out what to call it yet.

1291
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,900
Could be one of my most
important works.

1292
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:46,395
Except for one phrase.

1293
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:47,820
If I could find that,
then all the rest

1294
00:59:47,854 --> 00:59:49,140
would fall into place.

1295
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:54,528
I suppose that's the
story of my life.

1296

Finding that right note.

1297
00:59:57,134 --> 00:59:59,984
Perfect phrase, exact sound.

1298
01:00:01,027 --> 01:00:02,870
You know how
frustrating that can be.

1299

01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,239
Thank you.

have that bottle.

gonna kill myself.

1306
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:36,967
- Calm down.

1307
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:38,878
So a few extra people showed up.

1308
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:39,747
It always happens.

1309
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:40,650
- A few?

1310
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:41,936
This is hundreds.

1311
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,049
Maybe I should call the police.

1312
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,160
- Why?

1313
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:45,968
Sandra already brought a cop,
remember?

1314
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:50,695
- Excuse me, pardon me, dear.

01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:12,418
Mastercharge, Visa,

1320
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:13,460
- [Scott] No thanks, buddy.

1321
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:14,226
- Do you mind?

1322
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,477
- [Tony] Yes, I would.

1323

Keep walking, otherwise
we'll fuck up this shot.

Hey Carole.

What you need is an E

You interrupted my flow.

1420
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:03,403
- For acting like an asshole.

1421
01:06:03,438 --> 01:06:04,828
- I don't think I've
treated your or Jennie

1422
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:06,671
any differently than
I've treated anyone else.

1423
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:07,818
- Oh, so you treat
everyone badly.

1424
01:06:07,852 --> 01:06:09,312
- Please get out of here.

1425

go outside and settle this?

1436
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,593
I wanna talk to you.

1437
01:06:53,627 --> 01:06:55,469
- I don't feel like
talking right now.

1438
01:06:55,504 --> 01:06:56,581
- Why are you mad at me?

1439
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:57,798
I was just defending
you back there.

1440
01:06:57,832 --> 01:07:00,578
- I don't need you to defend me.

1441
01:07:00,613 --> 01:07:02,385
- Jennie, I don't get it.

1442
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:06,001
I mean, you're a very
special girl, you really are.

1443
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:08,225
But it makes me goddamn
mad that Camden Roxbury

1444
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:10,102
could just dismiss you like
you were the hired help.

1445
01:07:10,136 --> 01:07:12,222
- I don't really think
he meant it that way.

1446
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:14,411
- Camden Roxbury is an
arrogant fool.

1447
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,393
He doesn't give a damn
about anything but his work.

1448
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:18,131
- Well, maybe he has a
right to feel like that.

1449
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:20,529
- Would you stop defending him?

1450
01:07:20,563 --> 01:07:21,780
- You're just jealous.

1451
01:07:21,814 --> 01:07:23,449
- Yeah, you're right, I am.

1452
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:25,290
I wish you felt that
way about me,

1453
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:27,480
because I really care about you,
Jennie.

1454
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:28,767
I care about you so much.

1455
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:31,060
(horn honking)

1456
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:32,311
- I have to go.

1457
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:34,536
- No, for once can't we
just finish something?

1458
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:35,613
- Finish what?

1459
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:40,549
(horn honking)

1460
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,487
I can't.

1461
01:07:42,286 --> 01:07:43,295
- [Scott] Jennie.

1462
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:44,303
Jennie, no.

1463
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,548
- First my party's ruined,
then my house is destroyed,

1464
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:55,877
now someone's stolen my car.

1465
01:07:55,911 --> 01:07:59,665
- I've always said Barbara,
you throw one hell of a party.

1466
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:04,565
(uptempo party music)

1467
01:08:18,955 --> 01:08:22,119
(engine rumbling)

1468
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:41,026
- Oh, I should have never
come down here.

1469
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,833
I should have gone to
Vermont instead of acting

1470
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,058
like a silly adolescent.

1471
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:47,144
- Sounds like true love to me.

1472
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:51,627
My second husband was
exactly the same way.

1473
01:08:52,948 --> 01:08:53,886
- Really?

1474
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,276
What'd you do?

1475
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,493
- Divorced him.

1476
01:08:58,404 --> 01:09:00,699
- Great, that's just what
I need to hear.

1477
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:03,722
- Listen, lamb.

1478
01:09:03,757 --> 01:09:06,850
You come with me to the
concert tonight.

1479
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:09,353
I'm sure your girlfriend
will be there.

1480
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:11,334
You'll work the whole thing out.

1481
01:09:12,551 --> 01:09:13,454
- I hope so.

1482
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:19,050
Listen, Maggie,
about last night.

1483
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:22,978
Everything's sorta vague,
you know?

1484
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:25,897
- Listen, don't worry.

1485
01:09:25,932 --> 01:09:31,076
When you remember, and you
will, it'll be dynamite.

1486
01:09:42,442 --> 01:09:46,508
(speaking foreign language)

1487
01:09:51,374 --> 01:09:53,946
- That's the brightest
moon I've ever seen.

1488
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:58,117
- That's not the moon,
that's the sun.

1489
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,644
Have you ever had a
hangover this bad before?

1490
01:10:05,277 --> 01:10:06,354
- No.

1491
01:10:08,926 --> 01:10:11,776
- You know what I
gotta do today?

1492
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:13,931
I gotta finish my suite.

1493
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:14,870
- Our suite.

1494
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:17,789
- It's my suite.

1495
01:10:17,824 --> 01:10:18,902
Your note.

1496
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:24,498
You ever try to do
anything difficult?

1497
01:10:24,532 --> 01:10:28,181
You know, like sit down and
really work on your music?

1498
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:29,294
- Sure.

1499
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,596
It's about getting that
one lucky break.

1500
01:10:33,951 --> 01:10:37,079
- The only breaks you get are
the ones that you make happen.

1501
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:40,069
You want success but you
don't do anything about it.

1502
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:44,726
I know you got talent.

1503
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,340
So do I.

1504
01:10:48,376 --> 01:10:52,685
The only thing that makes
us different is desire.

1505
01:10:57,273 --> 01:10:58,698
Until you learn that,

1506
01:11:00,993 --> 01:11:03,251
you'll just be another
ripple in the pond.

1507
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:10,898
(speaking foreign language)

1508
01:11:10,932 --> 01:11:14,338
- It goes over here in
front of the sofa.

1509
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:18,405
(speaking foreign language)

1510
01:11:19,413 --> 01:11:21,151
- Must have been some party,
huh?

1511
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:23,306
- Yes, I'm surprised you
weren't there.

1512
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,148
- I was.

1513
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,129
Carola Minola, remember?

1514
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:29,493
(laughing)

1515
01:11:32,343 --> 01:11:35,262
(soft pop music)

1516
01:11:48,853 --> 01:11:49,826
- Hello.

1517
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,321
- Hello.

1518
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:52,606
- These are for you.

1519
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,309
- Thank you, they're beautiful.

1520
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:57,195
- Let me put 'em in
water for you.

1521
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:04,494
(chuckling)

1522
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:05,397
Jennie.

1523
01:12:08,038 --> 01:12:10,610
I want to apologize for
my behavior last night.

1524
01:12:10,645 --> 01:12:12,487
- Oh, let's talk about
something else, alright?

1525
01:12:12,522 --> 01:12:15,303
I'd really like to
forget last night.

1526
01:12:15,337 --> 01:12:16,867
- So would I.

1527
01:12:16,901 --> 01:12:19,126
If I could only remember
what happened.

1528
01:12:21,906 --> 01:12:23,957
Jennie, I'd still like
you to be my guest

1529
01:12:23,992 --> 01:12:25,312
at the concert tonight.

1530
01:12:26,703 --> 01:12:27,815
- Okay, I'd like that.

1531
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:30,874
- Good.

1532
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:32,820
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to add

1533
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,871
the finishing touches
to my suite.

1534
01:12:36,087 --> 01:12:37,651
Or die.

1535
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,972
Whichever comes first.

1536
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:42,378
Ciao.

1537
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:44,776
- Hi.

1538
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:46,028
- Morning Camden.

1539
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,383
- That's questionable.

1540
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:52,284
- What's he doing here?

1541
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:55,759
- He came to apologize and
he even brought me flowers.

1542
01:12:55,795 --> 01:12:56,489
- Flowers?

1543
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:57,394
I think that's romantic.

1544
01:12:57,428 --> 01:12:58,471
- Romantic?

1545
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:00,278
Since when have you been
into romantic?

1546
01:13:00,312 --> 01:13:01,911
I thought it was strictly Conan.

1547
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:03,893
- Oh yeah, whatever happened
to your appointment?

1548
01:13:03,928 --> 01:13:04,831
How'd it go?

1549
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:07,369
- It went.

1550
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:11,991
But, Conan turned out
to be just another jerk

1551
01:13:12,026 --> 01:13:13,312
in a leopard bikini.

1552
01:13:14,285 --> 01:13:16,440
- Something's gotta
hold him together.

1553
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:19,012
- Wasn't much to hold.

1554
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:21,480
- Hi y'all.

1555
01:13:21,514 --> 01:13:22,731
Hey, give me a minute to change

1556
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,538
so I can join ya on the beach.

1557
01:13:24,573 --> 01:13:27,076
I just can't wait to
share my joy.

1558
01:13:28,014 --> 01:13:30,516
- [Jennie] I think I'm
gonna be sick.

1559
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:33,158
(chattering)

1560
01:13:35,904 --> 01:13:37,641
- Okay, so after the
fourth time,

1561
01:13:37,677 --> 01:13:39,657
I just had to say, "Enough."

1562
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:41,916
- I'm gonna kill her.

1563
01:13:42,995 --> 01:13:44,384
- [Jennie] When are you
gonna see him again?

1564
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,261
- Tonight, I asked him
to the concert.

1565
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:47,895
He said he'd call me later.

1566
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,285
- What about Scott?

1567
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,004
- Oh, Scott's, he's just a guy.

1568
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:55,298
- Just a guy?

1569
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:58,287
Jennie, I saw him kiss
you last night.

1570
01:13:59,816 --> 01:14:01,554
That's not just a guy.

1571
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,586
- Yeah, well, I don't know.

1572
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:06,421
I'm so confused.

1573
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:07,602
On one hand, there's
Scott and on

1574
01:14:07,637 --> 01:14:09,479
the other hand there's Camden.

1575
01:14:09,513 --> 01:14:10,938
- I should have these problems.

1576
01:14:10,974 --> 01:14:12,469
(chuckling)

1577
01:14:12,503 --> 01:14:14,693
- Jennie, it's me, Carole.

1578
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:16,812
Remember me, your friend,
your pal?

1579
01:14:19,594 --> 01:14:20,983
You know you can talk
to yourself 'til you're

1580
01:14:21,019 --> 01:14:22,200
blue in the face,

1581
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,536
but actions speak
louder than words.

1582
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,082
That's really a boring phrase.

1583
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,195
- You're right.

1584
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:36,798
- Jennie, I was thinking
maybe you could take Scott

1585
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,030
and leave Camden for me.

1586
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:41,177
- Are you serious?

1587
01:14:41,212 --> 01:14:43,298
- You like my cousin Camden?

1588
01:14:45,244 --> 01:14:47,086
- Well, sorta.

1589
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:48,233
- Laurie!

1590
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:51,396
Now, I can understand Jennie
being attracted to him

1591
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:53,343
'cause he's her idol and all,
but you!

1592
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:57,513
I don't know, I just never
thought of him as your type.

1593
01:14:57,548 --> 01:15:00,676
- One never knows the
chemistry between

1594
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:04,430
a male and a female, does one?

1595
01:15:04,464 --> 01:15:07,106
- [Jennie] Whoa, I think
she means business.

1596
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,671
- Hey, listen, I'm gonna
go back to the room

1597
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:09,922
'cause I'm expecting that call.

1598
01:15:09,956 --> 01:15:11,798
- Good, see ya later.

1599
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:12,772
- [Sandra] Leave my towel, okay?

1600
01:15:12,806 --> 01:15:13,919
- Alright.

1601
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:15,204
So, wanna take a dip?

1602
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:16,143
- Yeah.

1603
01:15:16,873 --> 01:15:19,653
(mellow music)

1604
01:15:36,058 --> 01:15:38,804
- Are you sure you're
gonna be alright?

1605
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:42,072
(melancholy music)

1606
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,413
I feel bad leaving her here.

1607
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:53,229
- You can stop talking
behind my back.

1608
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:54,932
- [Carole] We weren't.

1609
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:55,870
Let's go.

1610
01:15:56,912 --> 01:15:58,233
- [Jennie] We'll save ya a seat.

1611
01:15:58,269 --> 01:15:59,554
Come and meet us.

1612
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:04,281
(applauding)

1613
01:16:11,232 --> 01:16:13,213
- Oh thank you, thank you.

1614
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:15,959
Isn't this a lovely night?

1615
01:16:15,995 --> 01:16:20,374
In case any of you didn't
know, I'm Barbara Roxbury.

1616
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:21,173
- [Woman] Hi Barb.

1617
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,425
- Oh, thank you.

1618
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:27,256
Well, welcome welcome one and
all to this year's concert

1619
01:16:28,403 --> 01:16:31,357
for the United Charities
of South Florida.

1620
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:35,284
We are very lucky to have
with us our own native son,

1621
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,065
and incidentally, my own son.

1622
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,351
(applauding)

1623
01:16:39,385 --> 01:16:43,974
Without further ado,
performing his world famous

1624
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:49,604
Quantum Sonata, Camden Roxbury.

1625
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:52,246
(applauding)

1626
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,301
(dramatic piano music)

1627
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,343
- Oh God.

1628
01:18:02,525 --> 01:18:05,965
Make it ring, and I'll
never eat another Godiva

1629
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,399
chocolate as long as I live.

1630
01:18:09,754 --> 01:18:13,264
(dramatic piano music)

1631
01:19:13,255 --> 01:19:15,132
- [Ernie] What are
you doing here?

1632
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:16,870
- [Sandra] What do you
mean what am I doing here?

1633
01:19:16,904 --> 01:19:18,677
You were supposed to pick me up.

1634
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:22,257
- [Ernie] Yeah, but come here,
you shouldn't come over here.

1635
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,933
- Well, I'm not used to
getting stood up.

1636
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,497
- I didn't stand you up.

1637
01:19:27,957 --> 01:19:29,034
- We had a date.

1638
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,529
I waited for you, you
didn't show up,

1639
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:32,614
now what would you call it?

1640
01:19:32,649 --> 01:19:34,630
- Sandy, I explained my
whole situation

1641
01:19:34,665 --> 01:19:36,403
when you and I just got started.

1642
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,589
- You're back with your wife,
aren't you?

1643
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:43,528
- No.

1644
01:19:47,769 --> 01:19:49,610
Yes.

1645
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:50,549
Not really.

1646
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:53,921
Look, she lost her job
and on my salary,

1647
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,006
I can't afford to pay
two rents honey,

1648
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,196
so I let her move back in.

1649
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,829
It's just for a while.

1650
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:01,602
- I see.

1651
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:03,027
- No, I don't know
if you do see.

1652
01:20:03,061 --> 01:20:05,981
I'm talking about I'm
in bad financial shape.

1653
01:20:06,015 --> 01:20:07,823
I'm confused. I don't know
if I'm coming or going,

1654
01:20:07,858 --> 01:20:09,283
all I know is I'm
crazy about you

1655
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:10,708
and there's nothing I
can do about it.

1656
01:20:10,743 --> 01:20:12,307
Do you understand me?

1657
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,671
All I'm asking you, honey, is
just give me a little time.

1658
01:20:14,705 --> 01:20:17,451
Please, a little time,
that's all.

1659
01:20:18,946 --> 01:20:23,325
- I don't think you're
ready to let go, are you?

1660
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:24,680
- What?

1661
01:20:24,715 --> 01:20:27,496
- I don't think you're
ready to let go

1662
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:31,388
and I can't afford
to hang around

1663
01:20:31,423 --> 01:20:35,003
and wait for you not
to be confused anymore.

1664
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,332
I mean, that just might
not happen, so,

1665
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,468
I think I need to be the
one who lets go.

1666
01:20:50,783 --> 01:20:51,930
Bye, Ernie.

1667
01:20:53,494 --> 01:20:57,004
(dramatic piano music)

1668
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:17,337
(applauding)
(cheering)

1669
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:25,471
- Thank you.

1670
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:28,737
Thank you.

1671
01:21:33,985 --> 01:21:36,558
For my next piece, I'd
like to play for you

1672
01:21:36,593 --> 01:21:39,199
a world premiere, something
I've just completed.

1673
01:21:40,902 --> 01:21:45,595
Inspired by a very lovely,
beautiful girl

1674
01:21:45,629 --> 01:21:47,054
who's very special to me.

1675
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:52,754
And now, Suite For Jennie.

- Chip.

1715
01:25:28,664 --> 01:25:29,673
- [Both] I'm sorry.

1716
01:25:31,654 --> 01:25:32,349
- I love you.

1717

(melancholy music)

1721
01:26:32,131 --> 01:26:33,174
- Hi Camden.

1722
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:42,627
I can't promise lasting
love or anything, but,

1723
01:26:43,635 --> 01:26:45,859
we could sure have one
hell of a night.

1724
01:26:49,822 --> 01:26:50,274
- [Carole] Honey?

1725
01:26:50,308 --> 01:26:51,316
- [Chip] Yeah?

1726
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,672
- [Carole] Are you sure
that Gary won't mind

1727
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:53,750
driving back all that way alone?

1728
01:26:53,784 --> 01:26:55,349
- Carole, he's not going back.

1729
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:57,086
He's transferring to Miami.

1730
01:26:59,032 --> 01:27:00,006
I got this, girls.

1731
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,013
- [Sandra] Thanks, Chip,
thank you.

1732
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,612
- [Chip] You bet.

1733
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:04,628
- Hey San?

1734
01:27:04,663 --> 01:27:05,358
- [Sandra] Mm?

1735
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:06,227
- You gonna be alright?

1736
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:07,618
- Ah yeah, I'll get over it.

1737
01:27:07,652 --> 01:27:08,695
- [Jennie] You sure?

1738
01:27:09,877 --> 01:27:10,989
- Yeah.

1739
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:12,066
- No what ifs?

1740
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:14,500
- And no regrets.

1741
01:27:14,534 --> 01:27:15,647
Where's Scott?

1742
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:17,246
- I don't know.

1743
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,470
He said he'd say goodbye
before we left.

1744
01:27:19,504 --> 01:27:21,138
- Oh darlin', I hope he
doesn't turn out

1745
01:27:21,173 --> 01:27:22,806
to be another Ernie.

1746

1747
01:27:23,745 --> 01:27:25,448
- Hey party animals.

1748
01:27:25,482 --> 01:27:28,020
Time to head back to the
real world, huh?

1749
01:27:28,055 --> 01:27:29,584
- [Jennie] Hey, did you
have a good time?

1750
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:30,870
- You bet I did.

1751
01:27:33,095 --> 01:27:33,998
Bye Conan.

1752
01:27:36,153 --> 01:27:37,890
You barbarian.

1753
01:27:44,669 --> 01:27:46,719
- I just wanna say thanks.

1754
01:27:46,754 --> 01:27:47,831
- I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1755
01:27:47,866 --> 01:27:50,021
Guess it just wasn't
meant to be.

1756
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,420
I'd still like to
consider you as my friend.

1757
01:27:52,454 --> 01:27:53,358
- Absolutely.

1758
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:57,215
I'll see ya later.

1759
01:27:57,251 --> 01:27:58,328
- Take care.

1760
01:28:00,448 --> 01:28:02,395
- We better hit the road.

1761
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:04,966
- But what about Scott?

1762
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:07,330
- I guess we said our
goodbyes last night.

1763
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:09,658
- Bye bye Sandra.

1764
01:28:09,694 --> 01:28:10,910
- Bye.

1765
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:12,474
- I got a paper to write.

1766
01:28:13,274 --> 01:28:14,559
- Come on guys, let's get going.

1767
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:17,166
- Yeah, let's roll.

1768
01:28:17,201 --> 01:28:18,278
- [Carole] Thank you.

1769
01:28:18,313 --> 01:28:19,599
- [Laurie] You guys get
all my stuff?

1770
01:28:19,634 --> 01:28:21,684
- [Jennie] Yep, it's
in the trunk.

1771
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,484
- [Camden] See ya later.

1772
01:28:22,519 --> 01:28:23,665
- [All] Bye.

1773
01:28:23,701 --> 01:28:25,404
- [Camden] Arrivederci. It's
a week I'll never forget.

1774
01:28:25,438 --> 01:28:26,794
- It was great, Camden.
