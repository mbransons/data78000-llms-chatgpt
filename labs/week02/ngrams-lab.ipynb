    "**Due:** September 17\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to explore ngram models. Ngram models are a good introduction to language models generally. Language models are probabilistic representations of language. Ngrams have the benefit of being easy to interrogate and relatively easy to understand (as compared to neural networks). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will build an ngram model from the corpus of your choosing. The example is with 'The Great Gatsby' from Project Gutenberg, but there's a code block for any text file on your computer  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "This lab is based heavily on the [nltk documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.lm.html)"
