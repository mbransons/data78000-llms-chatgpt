    "### Background\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to explore ngram models. Ngram models are a good introduction to language models generally. Language models are probabilistic representations of language. Ngrams have the benefit of being easy to interrogate and relatively easy to understand (as compared to neural networks). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will build an ngram model from the corpus of your choosing. The example is with 'The Great Gatsby' from Project Gutenberg, but there's a code block for any text file on your computer  \n",

      " in college I was unjustly accused of  being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,  unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have  feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by  some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on  the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least  the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and  marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of  infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I  forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly  repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out  unequally at birth.    And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission  that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the  wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded  on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted  the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I  wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the  human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was  exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I  have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of  successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some  heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related  to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten  thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that  flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the  “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a  romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and  which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out  all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust  floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my  interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle  Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a  clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of  Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s  brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil  War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father  carries on today.    I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with  special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in  father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of  a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that  delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the  counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being  the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the  ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond  business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it  could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it  over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,  “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance  me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I  thought, in the spring of twenty-two.    The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm  season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly  trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a  house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He  found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a  month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and  I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a  few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who  made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to  herself over the electric stove.    It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more  recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.    “How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.    I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,  a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the  freedom of the neighbourhood.    And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the  trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar  conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.    There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to  be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen  volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they  stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,  promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and  Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other  books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a  series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now  I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become  again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”  This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at  from a single window, after all.    It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of  the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender  riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where  there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of  land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in  contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most  domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great  wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the  egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact  end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual  wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more  interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular  except shape and size.    I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though  this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little  sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the  egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge  places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on  my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual  imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one  side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble  swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was  Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a  mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an  eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I  had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and  the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a  month.    Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg  glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins  on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom  Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom  in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in  Chicago.    Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of  the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a  national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute  limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of  anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his  freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago  and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for  instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake  Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was  wealthy enough to do that.    Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for  no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully  wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a  permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe  it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift  on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of  some irrecoverable football game.    And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East  Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house  was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white  Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at  the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,  jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when  it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though  from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French  windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm  windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with  his legs apart on the front porch.    He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy  straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a  supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established  dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning  aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding  clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill  those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could  see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his  thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.    His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of  fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in  it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who  had hated his guts.    “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to  say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We  were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I  always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like  him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.    We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.    “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about  restlessly.    Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the  front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half  acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped  the tide offshore.    “It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,  politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”    We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,  fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The  windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside  that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through  the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale  flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the  ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow  on it as wind does on the sea.    The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous  couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an  anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were  rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a  short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments  listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a  picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the  curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the  floor.    The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full  length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her  chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which  was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes  she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring  an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.    The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly  forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,  charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the  room.    “I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”    She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my  hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was  no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she  had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was  Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people  lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less  charming.)    At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost  imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object  she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her  something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.  Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned  tribute from me.    I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,  thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and  down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be  played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,  bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement  in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:  a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had  done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,  exciting things hovering in the next hour.    I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,  and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.    “Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.    “The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel  painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all  night along the north shore.”    “How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added  irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”    “I’d like to.”    “She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”    “Never.”    “Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”    Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped  and rested his hand on my shoulder.    “What you doing, Nick?”    “I’m a bond man.”    “Who with?”    I told him.    “Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.    This annoyed me.    “You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”    “Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at  Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something  more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”    At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that  I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the  room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned  and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.    “I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long  as I can remember.”    “Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to  New York all afternoon.”    “No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the  pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”    Her host looked at her incredulously.    “You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom  of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”    I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I  enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with  an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward  at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked  back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,  discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a  picture of her, somewhere before.    “You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody  there.”    “I don’t know a single—”    “You must know Gatsby.”    “Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”    Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;  wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled  me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.    Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two  young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward  the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the  diminished wind.    “Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her  fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She  looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day  of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in  the year and then miss it.”    “We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the  table as if she were getting into bed.    “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me  helplessly: “What do people plan?”    Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her  little finger.    “Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”    We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.    “You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,  but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a  great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”    “I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in  kidding.”    “Hulking,” insisted Daisy.    Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a  bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool  as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all  desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a  polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew  that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too  would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the  West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its  close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer  nervous dread of the moment itself.    “You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass  of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or  something?”    I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in  an unexpected way.    “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve  gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise  of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”    “Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.    “Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is  if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly  submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”    “Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of  unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in  them. What was that word we—”    “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her  impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to  us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will  have control of things.”    “We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously  toward the fervent sun.    “You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom  interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.    “This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,  and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a  slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the  things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all  that. Do you see?”    There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his  complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.  When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler  left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned  towards me.    “I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.  “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s  nose?”    “That’s why I came over tonight.”    “Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher  for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred  people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it  began to affect his nose—”    “Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.    “Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up  his position.”    For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her  glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I  listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering  regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.    The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,  whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went  inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned  forward again, her voice glowing and singing.    “I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an  absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:  “An absolute rose?”    This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only  extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart  was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,  thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and  excused herself and went into the house.    Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of  meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”  in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the  room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to  hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,  mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.    “This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.    “Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”    “Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.    “You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.  “I thought everybody knew.”    “I don’t.”    “Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”    “Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.    Miss Baker nodded.    “She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.  Don’t you think?”    Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a  dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at  the table.    “It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.    She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and  continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic  outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a  nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing  away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”    “Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light  enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”    The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head  decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,  vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes  at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I  was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to  avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but  I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain  hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill  metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation  might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone  immediately for the police.    The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss  Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into  the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,  trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed  Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In  its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.    Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and  her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that  turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be  some sedative questions about her little girl.    “We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even  if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”    “I wasn’t back from the war.”    “That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,  and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”    Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,  and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her  daughter.    “I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”    “Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you  what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”    “Very much.”    “It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was  less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of  the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right  away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I  turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a  girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be  in this world, a beautiful little fool.’    “You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a  convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I  know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”  Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and  she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m  sophisticated!”    The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my  belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me  uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to  exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a  moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as  if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret  society to which she and Tom belonged.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at  either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the  Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running  together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and  dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as  she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.    When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.    “To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in  our very next issue.”    Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she  stood up.    “Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the  ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”    “Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,  “over at Westchester.”    “Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”    I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous  expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the  sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard  some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I  had forgotten long ago.    “Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”    “If you’ll get up.”    “I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”    “Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a  marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you  together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push  you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”    “Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a  word.”    “She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let  her run around the country this way.”    “Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.    “Her family.”    “Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s  going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots  of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be  very good for her.”    Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.    “Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.    “From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our  beautiful white—”    “Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”  demanded Tom suddenly.    “Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we  talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept  up on us and first thing you know—”    “Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.    I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes  later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood  side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor  Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”    “I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were  engaged to a girl out West.”    “That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were  engaged.”    “It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”    “But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again  in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be  true.”    Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even  vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one  of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old  friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention  of being rumoured into marriage.    Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely  rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove  away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out  of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such  intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman  in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been  depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of  stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his  peremptory heart.    Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside  garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and  when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and  sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had  blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the  trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth  blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered  across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I  was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of  my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets  regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely  movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested  that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was  his of our local heavens.    I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and  that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he  gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched  out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was  from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced  seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute  and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked  once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the  unquiet darkness.                                        II    About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily  joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as  to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley  of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and  hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and  chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of  ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery  air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,  gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the  ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable  cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.    But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift  endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.  J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and  gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,  but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass  over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set  them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then  sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved  away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun  and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.    The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,  when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on  waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an  hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was  because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.    The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His  acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés  with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with  whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire  to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one  afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet  and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.    “We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”    I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination  to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption  was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.    I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked  back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s  persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of  yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact  Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.  One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an  all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a  garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed  Tom inside.    The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the  dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had  occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that  sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the  proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands  on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and  faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his  light blue eyes.    “Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the  shoulder. “How’s business?”    “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you  going to sell me that car?”    “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”    “Works pretty slow, don’t he?”    “No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,  maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”    “I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”    His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.  Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish  figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was  in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh  sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark  blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there  was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of  her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking  through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,  looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without  turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:    “Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”    “Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little  office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A  white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled  everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.    “I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”    “All right.”    “I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”    She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with  two chairs from his office door.    We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days  before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was  setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.    “Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor  Eckleburg.    “Awful.”    “It does her good to get away.”    “Doesn’t her husband object?”    “Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so  dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”    So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not  quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom  deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might  be on the train.    She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched  tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in  New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a  moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream  and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive  she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,  lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from  the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she  turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the  front glass.    “I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get  one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”    We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John  D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very  recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.    “What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the  taxi-window.    “All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”    “I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got  that kind?”    The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and  drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.    “That’s no police dog,” said Tom.    “No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment  in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the  brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog  that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”    “I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is  it?”    “That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten  dollars.”    The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it  somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and  settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the  weatherproof coat with rapture.    “Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.    “That dog? That dog’s a boy.”    “It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy  ten more dogs with it.”    We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the  summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great  flock of white sheep turn the corner.    “Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”    “No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you  don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”    “Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said  to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”    “Well, I’d like to, but—”    We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.  At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of  apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the  neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other  purchases, and went haughtily in.    “I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in  the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”    The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small  dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded  to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for  it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of  ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an  over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.  Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a  bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the  room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with  a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines  of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant  elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he  added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of  which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all  afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked  bureau door.    I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that  afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,  although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful  sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the  telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some  at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both  disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a  chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the  whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.    Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called  each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive  at the apartment door.    The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,  with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky  white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more  rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the  old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about  there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets  jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary  haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I  wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed  immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a  girl friend at a hotel.    Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just  shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he  was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He  informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later  that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of  Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His  wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with  pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven  times since they had been married.    Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now  attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,  which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With  the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a  change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage  was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her  assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she  expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be  revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.    “My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of  these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I  had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me  the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”    “What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.    “Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own  homes.”    “I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”    Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.    “It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes  when I don’t care what I look like.”    “But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.  McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could  make something of it.”    We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair  from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.  McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved  his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.    “I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to  bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of  all the back hair.”    “I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think  it’s—”    Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,  whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.    “You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and  mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”    “I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair  at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to  keep after them all the time.”    She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to  the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying  that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.    “I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.    Tom looked at him blankly.    “Two of them we have framed downstairs.”    “Two what?” demanded Tom.    “Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the  other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”    The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.    “Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.    “I live at West Egg.”    “Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named  Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”    “I live next door to him.”    “Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s  where all his money comes from.”    “Really?”    She nodded.    “I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”    This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.  McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:    “Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but  Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.    “I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.  All I ask is that they should give me a start.”    “Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as  Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of  introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”    “Do what?” she asked, startled.    “You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can  do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he  invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like  that.”    Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:    “Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”    “Can’t they?”    “Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say  is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them  I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”    “Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”    The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had  overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.    “You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.  “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and  they don’t believe in divorce.”    Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the  elaborateness of the lie.    “When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West  to live for a while until it blows over.”    “It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”    “Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back  from Monte Carlo.”    “Really.”    “Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”    “Stay long?”    “No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of  Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we  got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an  awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”    The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the  blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee  called me back into the room.    “I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost  married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was  below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below  you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”    “Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,  “at least you didn’t marry him.”    “I know I didn’t.”    “Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the  difference between your case and mine.”    “Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”    Myrtle considered.    “I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said  finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t  fit to lick my shoe.”    “You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.    “Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy  about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that  man there.”    She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I  tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.    “The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made  a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and  never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he  was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever  heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to  beat the band all afternoon.”    “She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.  “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the  first sweetie she ever had.”    The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all  present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at  all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated  sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to  get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,  but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident  argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet  high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed  their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening  streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and  without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible  variety of life.    Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath  poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.    “It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the  last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my  sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather  shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked  at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his  head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white  shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call  a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into  a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway  train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live  forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”    She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial  laughter.    “My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m  through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to  make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,  and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where  you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s  grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t  forget all the things I got to do.”    It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch  and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists  clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out  my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that  had worried me all the afternoon.    The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes  through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People  disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost  each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet  away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood  face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson  had any right to mention Daisy’s name.    “Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I  want to! Daisy! Dai—”    Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his  open hand.    Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s  voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of  pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the  door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the  scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled  here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and  the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to  spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of  Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.  Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.    “Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the  elevator.    “Where?”    “Anywhere.”    “Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.    “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was  touching it.”    “All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”    … I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the  sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.    “Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n  Bridge …”    Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the  Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for  the four o’clock train.                                       III    There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.  In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the  whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the  afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or  taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats  slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of  foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties  to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past  midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to  meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra  gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers  and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.    Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a  fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left  his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in  the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in  half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a  butler’s thumb.    At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several  hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas  tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with  glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of  harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark  gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and  stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that  most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.    By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,  but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and  cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have  come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from  New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and  salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in  strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is  in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden  outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual  innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic  meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.    The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and  now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of  voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,  spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups  change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the  same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave  here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,  joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,  glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under  the constantly changing light.    Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail  out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like  Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the  orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a  burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda  Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.    I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one  of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not  invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out  to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there  they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they  conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated  with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having  met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that  was its own ticket of admission.    I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg  blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly  formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,  it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen  me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a  peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay  Gatsby, in a majestic hand.    Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after  seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies  of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed  on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of  young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little  hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous  Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or  insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the  easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few  words in the right key.    As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or  three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an  amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,  that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place  in the garden where a single man could linger without looking  purposeless and alone.    I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when  Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble  steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous  interest down into the garden.    Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone  before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.    “Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally  loud across the garden.    “I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.  “I remembered you lived next door to—”    She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me  in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who  stopped at the foot of the steps.    “Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”    That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week  before.    “You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we  met you here about a month ago.”    “You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,  but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to  the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a  caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we  descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of  cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a  table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced  to us as Mr. Mumble.    “Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl  beside her.    “The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an  alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for  you, Lucille?”    It was for Lucille, too.    “I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always  have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and  he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from  Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”    “Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.    “Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the  bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two  hundred and sixty-five dollars.”    “There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”  said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with  anybody.”    “Who doesn’t?” I inquired.    “Gatsby. Somebody told me—”    The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.    “Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”    A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and  listened eagerly.    “I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s  more that he was a German spy during the war.”    One of the men nodded in confirmation.    “I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in  Germany,” he assured us positively.    “Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in  the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to  her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes  when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”    She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned  and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic  speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those  who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this  world.    The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now  being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were  spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were  three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate  given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that  sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a  greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had  preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function  of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg  condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its  spectroscopic gaiety.    “Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and  inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”    We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I  had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The  undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.    The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not  there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t  on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and  walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,  and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.    A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was  sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with  unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he  wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.    “What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.    “About what?”    He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.    “About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I  ascertained. They’re real.”    “The books?”    He nodded.    “Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice  durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pages  and—Here! Lemme show you.”    Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and  returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.    “See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed  matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a  triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,  too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”    He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,  muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable  to collapse.    “Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.  Most people were brought.”    Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.    “I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud  Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been  drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit  in a library.”    “Has it?”    “A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.  Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”    “You told us.”    We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.    There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing  young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples  holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the  corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or  relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the  traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had  sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and  between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,  while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A  pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a  baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than  finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was  a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny  drip of the banjoes on the lawn.    I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man  of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the  slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying  myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene  had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and  profound.    At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.    “Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First  Division during the war?”    “Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”    “I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen  you somewhere before.”    We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.  Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just  bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.    “Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”    “What time?”    “Any time that suits you best.”    It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked  around and smiled.    “Having a gay time now?” she inquired.    “Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an  unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over  there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and  this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”    For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.    “I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.    “What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”    “I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”    He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one  of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that  you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to  face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on  you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you  just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you  would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had  precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to  convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an  elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate  formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he  introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his  words with care.    Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler  hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him  on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of  us in turn.    “If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.  “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”    When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure  her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid  and corpulent person in his middle years.    “Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”    “He’s just a man named Gatsby.”    “Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”    “Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.  “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”    A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next  remark it faded away.    “However, I don’t believe it.”    “Why not?”    “I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”    Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he  killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would  have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from  the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That  was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial  inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and  buy a palace on Long Island Sound.    “Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject  with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.  They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”    There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra  leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.    “Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are  going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which  attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the  papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial  condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody  laughed.    “The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s  Jazz History of the World!’ ”    The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it  began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and  looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin  was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as  though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about  him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him  off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as  the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”  was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a  puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into  men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their  falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched  Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s  head for one link.    “I beg your pardon.”    Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.    “Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would  like to speak to you alone.”    “With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.    “Yes, madame.”    She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and  followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her  evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a  jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk  upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.    I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and  intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which  overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now  engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who  implored me to join him, I went inside.    The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was  playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady  from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of  champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,  that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was  weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with  gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering  soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for  when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they  assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow  black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes  on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and  went off into a deep vinous sleep.    “She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a  girl at my elbow.    I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights  with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet  from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was  talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after  attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent  way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals  she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:  “You promised!” into his ear.    The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall  was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly  indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in  slightly raised voices.    “Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”    “Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”    “We’re always the first ones to leave.”    “So are we.”    “Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.  “The orchestra left half an hour ago.”    In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond  credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives  were lifted, kicking, into the night.    As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and  Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last  word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into  formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.    Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she  lingered for a moment to shake hands.    “I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long  were we in there?”    “Why, about an hour.”    “It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I  wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully  in my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of  Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she  talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her  party at the door.    Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I  joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I  wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to  apologize for not having known him in the garden.    “Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another  thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity  than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t  forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine  o’clock.”    Then the butler, behind his shoulder:    “Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”    “All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”    “Good night.”    “Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant  significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired  it all the time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”    But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite  over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a  bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side  up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had  left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall  accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting  considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,  as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din  from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to  the already violent confusion of the scene.    A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in  the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the  tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.    “See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”    The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the  unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of  Gatsby’s library.    “How’d it happen?”    He shrugged his shoulders.    “I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.    “But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”    “Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole  matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It  happened, and that’s all I know.”    “Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”    “But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even  trying.”    An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.    “Do you want to commit suicide?”    “You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”    “You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving.  There’s another man in the car.”    The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained  “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was  now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened  wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a  pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively  at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.    Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant  groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment  before he perceived the man in the duster.    “Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”    “Look!”    Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it  for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it  had dropped from the sky.    “It came off,” someone explained.    He nodded.    “At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”    A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,  he remarked in a determined voice:    “Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”    At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,  explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any  physical bond.    “Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”    “But the wheel’s off!”    He hesitated.    “No harm in trying,” he said.    The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and  cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a  moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,  and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.  A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great  doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who  stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the  impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were  all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events  in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me  infinitely less than my personal affairs.    Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my  shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York  to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen  by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded  restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I  even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and  worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing  mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I  let it blow quietly away.    I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the  gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and  studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There  were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the  library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was  mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,  and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.    I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,  and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and  machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue  and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few  minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever  know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their  apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and  smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm  darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting  loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who  loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary  restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant  moments of night and life.    Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined  five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I  felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they  waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,  and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining  that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate  excitement, I wished them well.    For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I  found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,  because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it  was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of  tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world  concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,  even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it  was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a  borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about  it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me  that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a  row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved  her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached  the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his  statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been  mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.    Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw  that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence  from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.  She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this  unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she  was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to  the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.    It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you  never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on  that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving  a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our  fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.    “You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more  careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”    “I am careful.”    “No, you’re not.”    “Well, other people are,” she said lightly.    “What’s that got to do with it?”    “They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an  accident.”    “Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”    “I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s  why I like you.”    Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had  deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved  her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as  brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself  definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once  a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was  how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of  perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague  understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.    Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and  this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever  known.                                        IV    On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,  the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled  hilariously on his lawn.    “He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between  his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found  out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the  devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there  crystal glass.”    Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of  those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable  now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect  July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will  give you a better impression than my generalities of those who  accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of  knowing nothing whatever about him.    From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a  man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who  was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie  Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a  corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came  near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and  Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned  cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.    Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,  in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the  garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.  R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the  Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he  went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that  Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies  came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice  A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and  Beluga’s girls.    From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and  Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who  controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don  S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the  movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.  Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his  wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.  (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to  gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was  cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably  next day.    A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as  “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people  there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George  Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the  Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and  the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the  Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who  killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.    Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite  the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with  another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have  forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria  or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names  of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American  capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves  to be.    In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came  there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had  his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,  his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of  the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be  her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and  whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.    All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car  lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody  from its three-noted horn.    It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of  his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,  made frequent use of his beach.    “Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I  thought we’d ride up together.”    He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that  resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,  I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,  with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality  was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape  of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping  foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.    He saw me looking with admiration at his car.    “It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better  view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”    I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright  with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with  triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with  a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down  behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,  we started to town.    I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and  found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first  impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had  gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an  elaborate roadhouse next door.    And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg  village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished  and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured  suit.    “Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your  opinion of me, anyhow?”    A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that  question deserves.    “Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.  “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you  hear.”    So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation  in his halls.    “I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine  retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the  Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at  Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many  years. It is a family tradition.”    He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he  was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed  it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with  this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if  there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.    “What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.    “San Francisco.”    “I see.”    “My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”    His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a  clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling  my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.    “After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of  Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting  big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to  forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”    With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very  phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that  of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued  a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.    “Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very  hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a  commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I  took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there  was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t  advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty  men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last  they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of  dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave  me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the  Adriatic Sea!”    Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his  smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and  sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It  appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had  elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My  incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming  hastily through a dozen magazines.    He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,  fell into my palm.    “That’s the one from Montenegro.”    To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di  Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”    “Turn it.”    “Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”    “Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It  was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of  Doncaster.”    It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an  archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,  looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.    Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace  on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with  their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.    “I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his  souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something  about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,  I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there  trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.  “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”    “At lunch?”    “No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss  Baker to tea.”    “Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”    “No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak  to you about this matter.”    I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more  annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to  discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something  utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon  his overpopulated lawn.    He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared  the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of  red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with  the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.  Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a  glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting  vitality as we went by.    With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half  Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated  I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic  policeman rode alongside.    “All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white  card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.    “Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next  time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”    “What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”    “I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a  Christmas card every year.”    Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a  constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across  the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of  nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always  the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the  mystery and the beauty in the world.    A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two  carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for  friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short  upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of  Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we  crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white  chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I  laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in  haughty rivalry.    “Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;  “anything at all …”    Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby  for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes  picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.    “Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”    A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two  fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a  moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.    “—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand  earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”    “What?” I inquired politely.    But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and  covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.    “I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,  don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and  there.”    Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the  restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was  starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.    “Highballs?” asked the head waiter.    “This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the  presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street  better!”    “Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too  hot over there.”    “Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”    “What place is that?” I asked.    “The old Metropole.”    “The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with  faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t  forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It  was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all  evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a  funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All  right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his  chair.    “ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t  you, so help me, move outside this room.’    “It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the  blinds we’d of seen daylight.”    “Did he go?” I asked innocently.    “Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He  turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away  my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three  times in his full belly and drove away.”    “Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.    “Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.  “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”    The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered  for me:    “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”    “No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.    “This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other  time.”    “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”    A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more  sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with  ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around  the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people  directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have  taken one short glance beneath our own table.    “Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I  made you a little angry this morning in the car.”    There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.    “I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you  won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got  to come through Miss Baker?”    “Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great  sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all  right.”    Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,  leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.    “He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his  eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect  gentleman.”    “Yes.”    “He’s an Oggsford man.”    “Oh!”    “He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”    “I’ve heard of it.”    “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”    “Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.    “Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure  of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a  man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to  myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce  to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my  cuff buttons.”    I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of  oddly familiar pieces of ivory.    “Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.    “Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”    “Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very  careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s  wife.”    When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and  sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his  feet.    “I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you  two young men before I outstay my welcome.”    “Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem  raised his hand in a sort of benediction.    “You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced  solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies  and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his  hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on  you any longer.”    As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I  wondered if I had said anything to offend him.    “He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is  one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a  denizen of Broadway.”    “Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”    “No.”    “A dentist?”    “Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,  coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”    “Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.    The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s  Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I  would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of  some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could  start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the  single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.    “How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.    “He just saw the opportunity.”    “Why isn’t he in jail?”    “They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”    I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I  caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.    “Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to  someone.”    When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our  direction.    “Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you  haven’t called up.”    “This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”    They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of  embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.    “How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to  come up this far to eat?”    “I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”    I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One October day in nineteen-seventeen—    (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a  straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)    —I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks  and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on  shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the  soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the  wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in  front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,  in a disapproving way.    The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to  Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and  by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She  dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long  the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp  Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that  night. “Anyways, for an hour!”    When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was  beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had  never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she  didn’t see me until I was five feet away.    “Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”    I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the  older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red  Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she  couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was  speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at  sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the  incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on  him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I  didn’t realize it was the same man.    That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux  myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very  often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone  at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had  found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say  goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually  prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for  several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any  more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,  who couldn’t get into the army at all.    By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début  after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a  man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,  with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He  came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a  whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he  gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand  dollars.    I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the  bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June  night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle  of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.    “ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how  I do enjoy it.”    “What’s the matter, Daisy?”    I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.    “Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her  on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs  and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s  change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”    She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her  mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.  She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her  and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the  soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.    But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and  put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half  an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around  her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she  married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a  three months’ trip to the South Seas.    I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d  never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a  minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and  wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the  door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the  hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with  unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you  laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I  left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,  and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got  into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the  chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.    The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for  a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and  then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in  Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young  and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect  reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage  not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,  moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that  everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy  never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice  of hers …    Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first  time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew  Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and  woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was  half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man  she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby  with the officer in her white car.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza  for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.  The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in  the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered  like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:     “I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when   you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”    “It was a strange coincidence,” I said.    “But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”    “Why not?”    “Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”    Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that  June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of  his purposeless splendour.    “He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your  house some afternoon and then let him come over.”    The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and  bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that  he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.    “Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”    “He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be  offended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”    Something worried me.    “Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”    “He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is  right next door.”    “Oh!”    “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some  night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking  people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It  was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard  the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately  suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:    “ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I  want to see her right next door.’    “When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to  abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he  says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of  catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”    It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm  around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her  to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,  but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal  scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my  arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady  excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and  the tired.”    “And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to  me.    “Does she want to see Gatsby?”    “She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re  just supposed to invite her to tea.”    We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth  Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.  Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face  floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up  the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth  smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.                                        V    When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that  my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the  peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery  and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a  corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.    At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved  itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the  house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in  the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on  again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned  away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.    “Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.    “Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been  glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old  sport. In my car.”    “It’s too late.”    “Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made  use of it all summer.”    “I’ve got to go to bed.”    “All right.”    He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.    “I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call  up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”    “Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you  to any trouble.”    “What day would suit you?”    “What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to  put you to any trouble, you see.”    “How about the day after tomorrow?”    He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the  grass cut,” he said.    We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my  ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I  suspected that he meant my grass.    “There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.    “Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.    “Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of  beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make  much money, do you?”    “Not very much.”    This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.    “I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a  little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And  I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,  aren’t you, old sport?”    “Trying to.”    “Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time  and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather  confidential sort of thing.”    I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation  might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer  was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no  choice except to cut him off there.    “I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t  take on any more work.”    “You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he  thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at  lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,  hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be  responsive, so he went unwillingly home.    The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a  deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not  Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into  rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the  office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.    “Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.    “What?”    “Don’t bring Tom.”    “Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.    The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a  raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that  Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I  had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg  Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy  some cups and lemons and flowers.    The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived  from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour  later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel  suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,  and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.    “Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.    “The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”    “What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He  looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t  believe he saw a thing.    “Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they  thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The  Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”    I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at  the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the  delicatessen shop.    “Will they do?” I asked.    “Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old  sport.”    The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which  occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes  through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that  shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from  time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were  taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an  uncertain voice, that he was going home.    “Why’s that?”    “Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if  there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait  all day.”    “Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”    He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously  there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped  up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.    Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the  drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a  three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic  smile.    “Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”    The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I  had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear  alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a  dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with  glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.    “Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have  to come alone?”    “That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far  away and spend an hour.”    “Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is  Ferdie.”    “Does the gasoline affect his nose?”    “I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”    We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.    “Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.    “What’s funny?”    She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the  front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his  hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a  puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.    With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the  hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the  living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my  own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.    For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I  heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by  Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:    “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”    A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I  went into the room.    Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the  mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of  boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face  of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught  eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,  on the edge of a stiff chair.    “We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at  me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily  the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his  head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and  set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm  of the sofa and his chin in his hand.    “I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.    My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up  a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.    “It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.    I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on  the floor.    “We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as  matter-of-fact as it could ever be.    “Five years next November.”    The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least  another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate  suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac  Finn brought it in on a tray.    Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical  decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,  while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other  of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in  itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my  feet.    “Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.    “I’ll be back.”    “I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”    He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and  whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.    “What’s the matter?”    “This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to  side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”    “You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s  embarrassed too.”    “She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.    “Just as much as you are.”    “Don’t talk so loud.”    “You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only  that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”    He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable  reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other  room.    I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his  nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge  black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the  rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by  Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric  marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except  Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church  steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period”  craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay  five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would  have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the  heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate  decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on  the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have  always been obstinate about being peasantry.    After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile  rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’  dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening  the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,  leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the  garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had  seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little  now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that  silence had fallen within the house too.    I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of  pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They  were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if  some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of  embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when  I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief  before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply  confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of  exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little  room.    “Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I  thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.    “It’s stopped raining.”    “Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were  twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,  like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to  Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”    “I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told  only of her unexpected joy.    “I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to  show her around.”    “You’re sure you want me to come?”    “Absolutely, old sport.”    Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with  humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.    “My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole  front of it catches the light.”    I agreed that it was splendid.    “Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It  took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”    “I thought you inherited your money.”    “I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in  the big panic—the panic of the war.”    I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what  business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized  that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.    “Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the  drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in  either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean  you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”    Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of  brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.    “That huge place there?” she cried pointing.    “Do you like it?”    “I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”    “I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People  who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”    Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the  road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy  admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,  admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy  odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of  kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find  no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but  bird voices in the trees.    And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and  Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind  every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we  had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College  Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into  ghostly laughter.    We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender  silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,  and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a  dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It  was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily  about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own  apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat  down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in  the wall.    He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued  everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew  from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his  possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding  presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a  flight of stairs.    His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was  garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush  with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and  shaded his eyes and began to laugh.    “It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I  can’t—When I try to—”    He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a  third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed  with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,  dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to  speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,  he was running down like an over-wound clock.    Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent  cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and  his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.    “I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a  selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”    He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,  before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,  which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in  many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft  rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in  coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of  indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into  the shirts and began to cry stormily.    “They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the  thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such  beautiful shirts before.”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and  the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window  it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated  surface of the Sound.    “If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”  said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at  the end of your dock.”    Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what  he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal  significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the  great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very  near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to  the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of  enchanted objects had diminished by one.    I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects  in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting  costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.    “Who’s this?”    “That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”    The name sounded faintly familiar.    “He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”    There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the  bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently  when he was about eighteen.    “I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you  had a pompadour—or a yacht.”    “Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about  you.”    They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the  rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.    “Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a  small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to  us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”    He rang off.    “Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.    The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,  and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.    “Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to  just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you  around.”    I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence  made them feel more satisfactorily alone.    “I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the  piano.”    He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes  accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with  shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently  clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck  trousers of a nebulous hue.    “Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.    “I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.  “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up …”    “Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t  you, Ewing, old sport?”    “I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”    “We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The  grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.    In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.  He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her  on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the  gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.    When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the  bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.    “I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all  out of prac—”    “Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”     “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”    Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along  the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric  trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New  York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was  generating on the air.     “One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the   poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”    As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of  bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt  had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost  five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when  Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but  because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond  her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative  passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright  feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can  challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.    As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took  hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned  toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,  with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be  over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.    They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;  Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they  looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went  out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them  there together.                                        VI    About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one  morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.    “Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.    “Why—any statement to give out.”    It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard  Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either  wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and  with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”    It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.  Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his  hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all  summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends  such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to  him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house  at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly  up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a  source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to  say.    James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had  changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that  witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht  drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was  James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a  torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay  Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and  informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an  hour.    I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His  parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination  had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was  that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic  conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means  anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,  the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented  just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be  likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.    For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of  Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other  capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body  lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing  days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became  contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of  the others because they were hysterical about things which in his  overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.    But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque  and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of  ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock  ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled  clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his  fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an  oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for  his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of  reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on  a fairy’s wing.    An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,  to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He  stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the  drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s  work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to  Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the  day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.    Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,  of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The  transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire  found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,  suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him  from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,  the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and  sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid  journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable  shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in  Little Girl Bay.    To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,  that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I  suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked  him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of  them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and  extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and  bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a  yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the  Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.    He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with  Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even  jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk  might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by  reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five  years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.  It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye  came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody  inhospitably died.    I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid  man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one  phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage  violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to  Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay  parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he  formed the habit of letting liquor alone.    And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five  thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal  device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions  went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate  education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the  substantiality of a man.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with  the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,  which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time  of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and  nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while  Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of  misconceptions away.    It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several  weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in  New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself  with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday  afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom  Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really  surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.    They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and  a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.    “I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m  delighted that you dropped in.”    As though they cared!    “Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the  room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in  just a minute.”    He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he  would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in  a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted  nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,  thanks … I’m sorry—    “Did you have a nice ride?”    “Very good roads around here.”    “I suppose the automobiles—”    “Yeah.”    Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had  accepted the introduction as a stranger.    “I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”    “Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.  “So we did. I remember very well.”    “About two weeks ago.”    “That’s right. You were with Nick here.”    “I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.    “That so?”    Tom turned to me.    “You live near here, Nick?”    “Next door.”    “That so?”    Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back  haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until  unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.    “We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.  “What do you say?”    “Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”    “Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought  to be starting home.”    “Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself  now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you  stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped  in from New York.”    “You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of  you.”    This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.    “Come along,” he said—but to her only.    “I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”    Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see  that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.    “I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.    “Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.    Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.    “We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.    “I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but  I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse  me for just a minute.”    The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady  began an impassioned conversation aside.    “My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she  doesn’t want him?”    “She says she does want him.”    “She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He  frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be  old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to  suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”    Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted  their horses.    “Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  And  then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”    Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they  trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage  just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the  front door.    Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on  the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s  party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of  oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties  that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of  people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,  many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a  pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had  merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete  in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to  nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was  looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening  to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your  own powers of adjustment.    They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling  hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.    “These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me  any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad  to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.  I’m giving out green—”    “Look around,” suggested Gatsby.    “I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”    “You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”    Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.    “We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking  I don’t know a soul here.”    “Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely  human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom  and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies  the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.    “She’s lovely,” said Daisy.    “The man bending over her is her director.”    He took them ceremoniously from group to group:    “Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he  added: “the polo player.”    “Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”    But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the  polo player” for the rest of the evening.    “I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that  man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”    Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.    “Well, I liked him anyhow.”    “I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,  “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”    Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,  conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they  sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,  while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case  there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”    Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper  together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he  said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”    “Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any  addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a  moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that  except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t  having a good time.    We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had  been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two  weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air  now.    “How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”    The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my  shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.    “Wha’?”    A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf  with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:    “Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she  always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it  alone.”    “I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.    “We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody  that needs your help, Doc.’ ”    “She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without  gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in  the pool.”    “Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss  Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”    “Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.    “Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand  shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”    It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with  Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were  still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except  for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he  had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this  proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate  degree and kiss at her cheek.    “I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”    But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture  but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented  “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing  village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old  euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants  along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in  the very simplicity she failed to understand.    I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.  It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet  of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow  moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,  an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an  invisible glass.    “Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big  bootlegger?”    “Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.    “I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are  just big bootleggers, you know.”    “Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.    He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under  his feet.    “Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie  together.”    A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.    “At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said  with an effort.    “You didn’t look so interested.”    “Well, I was.”    Tom laughed and turned to me.    “Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under  a cold shower?”    Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,  bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and  would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up  sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change  tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.    “Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said  suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way  in and he’s too polite to object.”    “I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I  think I’ll make a point of finding out.”    “I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a  lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”    The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.    “Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.    Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where  “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,  was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of  Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from  her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling  her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?  Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare  and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with  one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would  blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.    I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,  and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had  run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights  were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the  steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,  and his eyes were bright and tired.    “She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.    “Of course she did.”    “She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”    He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.    “I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her  understand.”    “You mean about the dance?”    “The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of  his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”    He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and  say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with  that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be  taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back  to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five  years ago.    “And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to  understand. We’d sit for hours—”    He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit  rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.    “I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the  past.”    “Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you  can!”    He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the  shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.    “I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,  nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”    He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to  recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into  loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,  but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it  all slowly, he could find out what that thing was …    … One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the  street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where  there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They  stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night  with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes  of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the  darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the  corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really  formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could  climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the  pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.    His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He  knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable  visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like  the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the  tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At  his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the  incarnation was complete.    Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was  reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,  that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase  tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,  as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled  air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was  uncommunicable forever.                                       VII    It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights  in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as  it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I  become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his  drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering  if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a  villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.    “Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”    “Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.    “I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.  Carraway came over.”    “Who?” he demanded rudely.    “Carraway.”    “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”    Abruptly he slammed the door.    My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his  house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never  went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered  moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that  the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the  village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.    Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.    “Going away?” I inquired.    “No, old sport.”    “I hear you fired all your servants.”    “I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite  often—in the afternoons.”    So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the  disapproval in her eyes.    “They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all  brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”    “I see.”    He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her  house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy  herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was  coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would  choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing  scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.    The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of  the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only  the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering  hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of  combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into  her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her  fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her  pocketbook slapped to the floor.    “Oh, my!” she gasped.    I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it  at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that  I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,  suspected me just the same.    “Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …  Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”    My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.  That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,  whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!    … Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying  the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at  the door.    “The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m  sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this  noon!”    What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”    He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to  take our stiff straw hats.    “Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the  direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the  common store of life.    The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and  Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down  their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.    “We can’t move,” they said together.    Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment  in mine.    “And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.    Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall  telephone.    Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with  fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting  laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.    “The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the  telephone.”    We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very  well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations  to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I  won’t stand that at all!”    “Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.    “No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to  know about it.”    Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his  thick body, and hurried into the room.    “Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed  dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”    “Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.    As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and  pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.    “You know I love you,” she murmured.    “You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.    Daisy looked around doubtfully.    “You kiss Nick too.”    “What a low, vulgar girl!”    “I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.  Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just  as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.    “Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your  own mother that loves you.”    The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and  rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.    “The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy  hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”    Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.  Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he  had ever really believed in its existence before.    “I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to  Daisy.    “That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent  into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You  absolute little dream.”    “Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress  too.”    “How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that  she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”    “Where’s Daddy?”    “She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like  me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”    Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held  out her hand.    “Come, Pammy.”    “Goodbye, sweetheart!”    With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to  her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,  preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.    Gatsby took up his drink.    “They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.    We drank in long, greedy swallows.    “I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom  genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into  the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting  colder every year.    “Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look  at the place.”    I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in  the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.  Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed  across the bay.    “I’m right across from you.”    “So you are.”    Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy  refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat  moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped  ocean and the abounding blessed isles.    “There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there  with him for about an hour.”    We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and  drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.    “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the  day after that, and the next thirty years?”    “Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it  gets crisp in the fall.”    “But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and  everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”    Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding  its senselessness into forms.    “I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to  Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a  garage.”    “Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes  floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”    Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in  space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.    “You always look so cool,” she repeated.    She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was  astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and  then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew  a long time ago.    “You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.  “You know the advertisement of the man—”    “All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to  town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”    He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one  moved.    “Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?  If we’re going to town, let’s start.”    His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips  the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out  on to the blazing gravel drive.    “Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going  to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”    “Everybody smoked all through lunch.”    “Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”    He didn’t answer.    “Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”    They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there  shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon  hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed  his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.    “Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.    “About a quarter of a mile down the road.”    “Oh.”    A pause.    “I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.  “Women get these notions in their heads—”    “Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.    “I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.    Gatsby turned to me rigidly:    “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”    “She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I  hesitated.    “Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.    That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that  was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of  it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s  daughter, the golden girl …    Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed  by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and  carrying light capes over their arms.    “Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green  leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”    “Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.    “Yes.”    “Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”    The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.    “I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.    “Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And  if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a  drugstore nowadays.”    A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom  frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar  and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in  words, passed over Gatsby’s face.    “Come on, Daisy” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s  car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”    He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.    “You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”    She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan  and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the  unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive  heat, leaving them out of sight behind.    “Did you see that?” demanded Tom.    “See what?”    He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known  all along.    “You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,  but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to  do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”    He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back  from the edge of theoretical abyss.    “I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I  could have gone deeper if I’d known—”    “Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.    “What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”    “About Gatsby.”    “About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small  investigation of his past.”    “And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.    “An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink  suit.”    “Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”    “Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like  that.”    “Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”  demanded Jordan crossly.    “Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows  where!”    We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we  drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded  eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution  about gasoline.    “We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.    “But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to  get stalled in this baking heat.”    Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty  stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from  the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.    “Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we  stopped for—to admire the view?”    “I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”    “What’s the matter?”    “I’m all run down.”    “Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on  the phone.”    With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,  breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his  face was green.    “I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money  pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your  old car.”    “How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”    “It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.    “Like to buy it?”    “Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money  on the other.”    “What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”    “I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go  West.”    “Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.    “She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment  against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she  wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”    The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a  waving hand.    “What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.    “I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked  Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering  you about the car.”    “What do I owe you?”    “Dollar twenty.”    The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a  bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t  alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life  apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically  sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel  discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there  was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as  the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that  he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor  girl with child.    “I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow  afternoon.”    That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare  of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of  something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.  Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that  other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than  twenty feet away.    In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved  aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So  engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and  one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a  slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it  was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle  Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized  that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on  Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we  drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his  mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping  precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the  accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving  Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an  hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in  sight of the easygoing blue coupé.    “Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested  Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.  There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of  funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”    The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but  before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy  signalled us to draw up alongside.    “Where are we going?” she cried.    “How about the movies?”    “It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you  after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some  corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”    “We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave  out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of  Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”    Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if  the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I  think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his  life forever.    But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging  the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.    The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into  that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in  the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around  my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.  The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five  bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as  “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it  was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and  thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …    The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four  o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery  from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,  fixing her hair.    “It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone  laughed.    “Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.    “There aren’t any more.”    “Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”    “The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.  “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”    He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the  table.    “Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one  that wanted to come to town.”    There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its  nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse  me”—but this time no one laughed.    “I’ll pick it up,” I offered.    “I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in  an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.    “That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.    “What is?”    “All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”    “Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if  you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.  Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”    As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound  and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s  Wedding March from the ballroom below.    “Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.    “Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.  “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”    “Biloxi,” he answered shortly.    “A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a  fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”    “They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived  just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy  told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  After  a moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”    “I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.    “That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he  left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”    The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer  floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of  “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.    “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and  dance.”    “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”    “Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a  friend of Daisy’s.”    “He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in  the private car.”    “Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa  Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room  for him.”    Jordan smiled.    “He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of  your class at Yale.”    Tom and I looked at each other blankly.    “Biloxi?”    “First place, we didn’t have any president—”    Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.    “By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”    “Not exactly.”    “Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”    “Yes—I went there.”    A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:    “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”    Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice  but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing  of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.    “I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.    “I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”    “It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I  can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”    Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all  looking at Gatsby.    “It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the  armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in  England or France.”    I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those  renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.    Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.    “Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.  Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”    “Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more  question.”    “Go on,” Gatsby said politely.    “What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”    They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.    “He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the  other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”    “Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest  thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your  wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people  begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next  they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between  black and white.”    Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone  on the last barrier of civilization.    “We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.    “I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose  you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any  friends—in the modern world.”    Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he  opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so  complete.    “I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy  guessed at his intention.    “Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go  home. Why don’t we all go home?”    “That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”    “I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”    “Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you.  She loves me.”    “You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.    Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.    “She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you  because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a  terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”    At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted  with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had  anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously  of their emotions.    “Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal  note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”    “I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five  years—and you didn’t know.”    Tom turned to Daisy sharply.    “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”    “Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved  each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to  laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that  you didn’t know.”    “Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a  clergyman and leaned back in his chair.    “You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five  years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I  see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries  to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy  loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”    “No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.    “She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish  ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded  sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off  on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in  my heart I love her all the time.”    “You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,  dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do  you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you  to the story of that little spree.”    Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.    “Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter  any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s  all wiped out forever.”    She looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”    “You never loved him.”    She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,  as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she  had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done  now. It was too late.    “I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.    “Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.    “No.”    From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were  drifting up on hot waves of air.    “Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your  shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”    “Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.  She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried  to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette  and the burning match on the carpet.    “Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t  that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob  helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”    Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.    “You loved me too?” he repeated.    “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were  alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,  things that neither of us can ever forget.”    The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.    “I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited  now—”    “Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful  voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”    “Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.    She turned to her husband.    “As if it mattered to you,” she said.    “Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now  on.”    “You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re  not going to take care of her any more.”    “I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to  control himself now. “Why’s that?”    “Daisy’s leaving you.”    “Nonsense.”    “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.    “She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.  “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he  put on her finger.”    “I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”    “Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that  hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve  made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it  further tomorrow.”    “You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.    “I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke  rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street  drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the  counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a  bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”    “What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter  Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”    “And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for  a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the  subject of you.”    “He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old  sport.”    “Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said  nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but  Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”    That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.    “That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,  “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me  about.”    I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her  husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but  absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to  Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said  in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had  “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in  just that fantastic way.    It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying  everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been  made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into  herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the  afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,  struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across  the room.    The voice begged again to go.    “Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”    Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage  she had had, were definitely gone.    “You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”    She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous  scorn.    “Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous  little flirtation is over.”    They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,  isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.    After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of  whisky in the towel.    “Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”    I didn’t answer.    “Nick?” He asked again.    “What?”    “Want any?”    “No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”    I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a  new decade.    It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started  for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but  his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on  the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy  has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments  fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of  loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning  briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside  me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten  dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face  fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of  thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.    So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the  ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept  through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the  garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale  as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go  to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if  he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent  racket broke out overhead.    “I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.  “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re  going to move away.”    Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and  Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.  Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he  sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars  that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably  laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not  his own.    So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson  wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious  glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain  times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some  workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis  took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he  didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside  again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation  because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in  the garage.    “Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty  little coward!”    A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and  shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.    The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out  of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then  disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of  its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The  other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards  beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life  violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark  blood with the dust.    Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open  her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left  breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen  for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at  the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the  tremendous vitality she had stored so long.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still  some distance away.    “Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at  last.”    He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as  we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage  door made him automatically put on the brakes.    “We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”    I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly  from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked  toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered  over and over in a gasping moan.    “There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.    He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the  garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal  basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a  violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way  through.    The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it  was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals  deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.    Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another  blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on  a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending  over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking  down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I  couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed  clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the  raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to  the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low  voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his  shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly  from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk  back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,  horrible call:    “Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”    Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around  the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to  the policeman.    “M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”    “No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”    “Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.    “r—” said the policeman, “o—”    “g—”    “g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.  “What you want, fella?”    “What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”    “Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”    “Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.    “She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”    “There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”    “Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.    “One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but  stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one  comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles  an hour.”    “What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.    “Hasn’t got any name.”    A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.    “It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”    “See the accident?” asked the policeman.    “No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going  fifty, sixty.”    “Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his  name.”    Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in  the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his  grasping cries:    “You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind  of car it was!”    Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten  under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in  front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.    “You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing  gruffness.    Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then  would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.    “Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute  ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking  about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you  hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”    Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the  policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent  eyes.    “What’s all that?” he demanded.    “I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on  Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow  car.”    Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.    “And what colour’s your car?”    “It’s a blue car, a coupé.”    “We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.    Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and  the policeman turned away.    “Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”    Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set  him down in a chair, and came back.    “If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped  authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced  at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the  door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the  table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”    Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we  pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,  case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.    Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down  hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I  heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down  his face.    “The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark  rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the  second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.    “Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and  frowned slightly.    “I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can  do tonight.”    A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.  As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of  the situation in a few brisk phrases.    “I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting  you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some  supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”    “No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait  outside.”    Jordan put her hand on my arm.    “Won’t you come in, Nick?”    “No, thanks.”    I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan  lingered for a moment more.    “It’s only half-past nine,” she said.    I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,  and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of  this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the  porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head  in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s  voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from  the house, intending to wait by the gate.    I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped  from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird  by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity  of his pink suit under the moon.    “What are you doing?” I inquired.    “Just standing here, old sport.”    Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was  going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to  see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in  the dark shrubbery.    “Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.    “Yes.”    He hesitated.    “Was she killed?”    “Yes.”    “I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock  should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”    He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.    “I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in  my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be  sure.”    I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to  tell him he was wrong.    “Who was the woman?” he inquired.    “Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did  it happen?”    “Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I  guessed at the truth.    “Was Daisy driving?”    “Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see,  when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would  steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were  passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but  it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were  somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward  the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second  my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her  instantly.”    “It ripped her open—”    “Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I  tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency  brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.    “She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to  wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness  this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries  any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”    “He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”    “I don’t trust him, old sport.”    “How long are you going to wait?”    “All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”    A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy  had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might  think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright  windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground  floor.    “You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a  commotion.”    I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel  softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains  were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where  we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small  rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind  was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.    Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,  with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of  ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his  earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a  while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.    They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the  ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air  of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said  that they were conspiring together.    As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the  dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in  the drive.    “Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.    “Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get  some sleep.”    He shook his head.    “I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”    He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his  scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of  the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the  moonlight—watching over nothing.                                       VIII    I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the  Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,  frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,  and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I  had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning  would be too late.    Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was  leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.    “Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock  she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned  out the light.”    His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when  we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside  curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of  dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of  splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable  amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they  hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar  table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French  windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.    “You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace  your car.”    “Go away now, old sport?”    “Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”    He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he  knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and  I couldn’t bear to shake him free.    It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with  Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass  against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played  out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without  reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.    She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed  capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with  indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly  desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from  Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a  beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless  intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her  as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,  a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other  bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its  corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already  in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s  shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely  withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved  Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all  about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still  vibrant emotions.    But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal  accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was  at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the  invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he  made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and  unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took  her because he had no real right to touch her hand.    He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under  false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom  millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he  let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as  herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of  fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing  behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government  to be blown anywhere about the world.    But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had  imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but  now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a  grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize  just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her  rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt  married to her, that was all.    When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,  who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought  luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as  she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She  had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming  than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and  mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many  clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the  hot struggles of the poor.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    “I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,  old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she  didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot  because I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off  my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden  I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have  a better time telling her what I was going to do?”    On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his  arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the  room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his  arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon  had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory  for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer  in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with  another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder  or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were  asleep.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he  went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his  majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the  armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or  misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there  was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see  why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world  outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her  and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.    For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids  and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of  the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new  tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the  “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver  slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were  always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,  while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the  sad horns around the floor.    Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the  season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with  half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and  chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor  beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a  decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision  must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable  practicality—that was close at hand.    That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom  Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his  position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain  struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was  still at Oxford.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of  the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,  gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew  and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a  slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,  lovely day.    “I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window  and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was  very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that  frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap  sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”    He sat down gloomily.    “Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were  first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”    Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.    “In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”    What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his  conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?    He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their  wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to  Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,  walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through  the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which  they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always  seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea  of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded  with a melancholy beauty.    He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found  her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless  now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a  folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar  buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow  trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have  seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.    The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it  sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing  city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand  desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of  the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too  fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part  of it, the freshest and the best, forever.    It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the  porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there  was an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of  Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.    “I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start  falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”    “Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.  “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”    I looked at my watch and stood up.    “Twelve minutes to my train.”    I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of  work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I  missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.    “I’ll call you up,” I said finally.    “Do, old sport.”    “I’ll call you about noon.”    We walked slowly down the steps.    “I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he  hoped I’d corroborate this.    “I suppose so.”    “Well, goodbye.”    We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I  remembered something and turned around.    “They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the  whole damn bunch put together.”    I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever  gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he  nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and  understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact  all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of  colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I  first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and  drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his  corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his  incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.    I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for  that—I and the others.    “Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an  interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.  Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat  breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me  up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between  hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other  way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,  as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the  office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.    “I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going  down to Southampton this afternoon.”    Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act  annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.    “You weren’t so nice to me last night.”    “How could it have mattered then?”    Silence for a moment. Then:    “However—I want to see you.”    “I want to see you, too.”    “Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this  afternoon?”    “No—I don’t think this afternoon.”    “Very well.”    “It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”    We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking  any longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I  know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table  that day if I never talked to her again in this world.    I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I  tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was  being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my  timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I  leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed  deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a  curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark  spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what  had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he  could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was  forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at  the garage after we left there the night before.    They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have  broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she  was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had  already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she  immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the  affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in  the wake of her sister’s body.    Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front  of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on  the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and  everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.  Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis  and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later  two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger  to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own  place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with  Wilson until dawn.    About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering  changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He  announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car  belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his  wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose  swollen.    But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,  my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt  to distract him.    “How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit  still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been  married?”    “Twelve years.”    “Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a  question. Did you ever have any children?”    The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and  whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it  sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.  He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was  stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably  around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from  time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.    “Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you  haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church  and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”    “Don’t belong to any.”    “You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must  have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen,  George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”    “That was a long time ago.”    The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment  he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came  back into his faded eyes.    “Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.    “Which drawer?”    “That drawer—that one.”    Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it  but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided  silver. It was apparently new.    “This?” he inquired, holding it up.    Wilson stared and nodded.    “I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I  knew it was something funny.”    “You mean your wife bought it?”    “She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”    Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen  reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably  Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,  because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter  left several explanations in the air.    “Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.    “Who did?”    “I have a way of finding out.”    “You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to  you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit  quiet till morning.”    “He murdered her.”    “It was an accident, George.”    Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened  slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”    “I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I  don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know  it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he  wouldn’t stop.”    Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there  was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had  been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any  particular car.    “How could she of been like that?”    “She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.  “Ah-h-h—”    He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his  hand.    “Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”    This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:  there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later  when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,  and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue  enough outside to snap off the light.    Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey  clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the  faint dawn wind.    “I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she  might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the  window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and  leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what  you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but  you can’t fool God!’ ”    Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at  the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and  enormous, from the dissolving night.    “God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.    “That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him  turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson  stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding  into the twilight.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a  car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before  who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which  he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and  Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and  hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.    His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to  Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that  he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and  walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far  there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who  had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared  oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared  from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,  that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time  going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On  the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and  perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to  know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the  way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the  butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the  pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had  amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to  pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be  taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the  front right fender needed repair.    Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he  stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he  needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among  the yellowing trees.    No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep  and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone  to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t  believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was  true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a  high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have  looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered  as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight  was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without  being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted  fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward  him through the amorphous trees.    The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the  shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything  much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house  and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that  alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a  word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried  down to the pool.    There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the  fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.  With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden  mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that  scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental  course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves  revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red  circle in the water.    It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener  saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was  complete.                                        IX    After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and  the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and  newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched  across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but  little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and  there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the  pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the  expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and  the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper  reports next morning.    Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,  eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought  to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale  would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might  have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount  of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes  under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never  seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,  that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced  herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very  suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a  man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its  simplest form. And it rested there.    But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself  on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the  catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every  practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and  confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or  speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because  no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense  personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.    I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her  instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away  early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.    “Left no address?”    “No.”    “Say when they’d be back?”    “No.”    “Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”    “I don’t know. Can’t say.”    I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where  he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t  worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”    Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me  his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the  time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the  phone.    “Will you ring again?”    “I’ve rung three times.”    “It’s very important.”    “Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”    I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they  were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled  it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with  shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:    “Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got  to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”    Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going  upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d  never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was  nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,  staring down from the wall.    Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,  which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next  train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure  he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a  wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem  arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and  newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began  to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby  and me against them all.     Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of   my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a   mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down   now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get   mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little   later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when   I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and   out.                                   Yours truly                                 Meyer Wolfshiem    and then hasty addenda beneath:     Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.    When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was  calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came  through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.    “This is Slagle speaking …”    “Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.    “Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”    “There haven’t been any wires.”    “Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when  he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New  York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know  about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”    “Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr.  Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”    There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an  exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz  arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was  leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.    It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,  bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His  eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and  umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse  grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on  the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him  sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and  the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.    “I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the  Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”    “I didn’t know how to reach you.”    His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.    “It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”    “Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.    “I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”    “Carraway.”    “Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”    I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him  there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into  the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly  away.    After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth  ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and  unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the  quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the  first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great  rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be  mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he  took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been  deferred until he came.    “I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”    “Gatz is my name.”    “—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”    He shook his head.    “Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in  the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”    “We were close friends.”    “He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,  but he had a lot of brain power here.”    He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.    “If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.  Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”    “That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.    He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the  bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.    That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to  know who I was before he would give his name.    “This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.    “Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”    I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at  Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a  sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They  were hard to find.    “The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house.  I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”    “Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see  anybody, but if I do.”    His tone made me suspicious.    “Of course you’ll be there yourself.”    “Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”    “Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”    “Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with  some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with  them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of  course I’ll do my best to get away.”    I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he  went on nervously:    “What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if  it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,  they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My  address is care of B. F.—”    I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.    After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I  telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was  my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at  Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known  better than to call him.    The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer  Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I  pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The  Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone  inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an  argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess  appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile  eyes.    “Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”    The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to  whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.    “Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”    “I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”    At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”  from the other side of the door.    “Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him  when he gets back.”    “But I know he’s there.”    She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up  and down her hips.    “You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she  scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago,  he’s in Chicago.”    I mentioned Gatsby.    “Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your  name?”    She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the  doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking  in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered  me a cigar.    “My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major  just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.  He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he  couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he  came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a  job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some  lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food  in half an hour.”    “Did you start him in business?” I inquired.    “Start him! I made him.”    “Oh.”    “I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right  away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told  me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join  the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did  some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like  that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”    I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series  transaction in 1919.    “Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend,  so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”    “I’d like to come.”    “Well, come then.”    The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head  his eyes filled with tears.    “I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.    “There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”    “When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any  way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend  of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may  think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”    I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,  so I stood up.    “Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.    For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he  only nodded and shook my hand.    “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and  not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let  everything alone.”    When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West  Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found  Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his  son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he  had something to show me.    “Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling  fingers. “Look there.”    It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty  with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look  there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so  often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.    “Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up  well.”    “Very well. Had you seen him lately?”    “He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in  now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see  now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of  him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”    He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another  minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and  pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong  Cassidy.    “Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows  you.”    He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On  the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September  12, 1906. And underneath:        Rise from bed                                  6:00      a.m.      Dumbell exercise and wall-scaling              6:15-6:30 ”      Study electricity, etc.                        7:15-8:15 ”      Work                                           8:30-4:30 p.m.      Baseball and sports                            4:30-5:00 ”      Practise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 ”      Study needed inventions                        7:00-9:00 ”                   General Resolves      * No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]      * No more smokeing or chewing.      * Bath every other day      * Read one improving book or magazine per week      * Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week      * Be better to parents    “I came across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It just  shows you, don’t it?”    “It just shows you.”    “Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this  or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He  was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat  him for it.”    He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then  looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the  list for my own use.    A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and  I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did  Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and  stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he  spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced  several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait  for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery  and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,  horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the  limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman  from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we  started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then  the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I  looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found  marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months  before.    I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the  funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and  he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled  from Gatsby’s grave.    I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already  too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that  Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur  “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed  man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.    We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke  to me by the gate.    “I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.    “Neither could anybody else.”    “Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the  hundreds.”    He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.    “The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school  and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than  Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a  December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into  their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember  the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the  chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught  sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you  going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long  green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky  yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking  cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.    When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,  began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and  the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild  brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we  walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware  of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we  melted indistinguishably into it again.    That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede  towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street  lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly  wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a  little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent  from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are  still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this  has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and  Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some  deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.    Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware  of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the  Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the  children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of  distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic  dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at  once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging  sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress  suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a  drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over  the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a  house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one  cares.    After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted  beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle  leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the  line I decided to come back home.    There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant  thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to  leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent  sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and  around what had happened to us together, and what had happened  afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big  chair.    She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like  a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the  colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the  fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without  comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though  there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I  pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t  making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up  to say goodbye.    “Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw  me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it  was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”    We shook hands.    “Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about  driving a car?”    “Why—not exactly.”    “You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?  Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me  to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,  straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”    “I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and  call it honour.”    She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously  sorry, I turned away.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead  of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a  little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving  sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as  I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into  the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,  holding out his hand.    “What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”    “Yes. You know what I think of you.”    “You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know  what’s the matter with you.”    “Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”    He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about  those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after  me and grabbed my arm.    “I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were  getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in  he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if  I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his  pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.  “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw  dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough  one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even  stopped his car.”    There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it  wasn’t true.    “And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when  I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits  sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By  God it was awful—”    I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done  was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and  confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up  things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their  vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let  other people clean up the mess they had made …    I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as  though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery  store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff  buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had  grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never  took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and  pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to  East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story  about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when  I got off the train.    I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,  dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still  hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,  and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a  material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I  didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away  at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.    On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,  I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once  more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a  piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,  drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the  beach and sprawled out on the sand.    Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any  lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the  Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to  melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that  flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new  world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s  house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all  human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his  breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic  contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the  last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for  wonder.    And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of  Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of  Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream  must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He  did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that  vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic  rolled on under the night.    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by  year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no  matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And  one fine morning—    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into  the past.                            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GREAT GATSBY ***                      Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will  be renamed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™    Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life.    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future  generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation    Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread  public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS.    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state  visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate.    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support.    Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition.    Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org.    This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.      \n"

      "     Chapter I The Cyclone   Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.  When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.  When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.  Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.  It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.  Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.  From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.  Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.  “There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife. “I’ll go look after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.  Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.  “Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”  Toto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.  Then a strange thing happened.  The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.  The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.  It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.  Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.  Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.  Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.  In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.     Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins   She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.  The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.  The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.  While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.  Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.  When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:  “You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.”  Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.  But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything.”  “Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.”  Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.  “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”  “There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.  “But who was she?” asked Dorothy.  “She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little woman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.”  “Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.  “They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.”  “Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.  “No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North. When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”  “Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”  “Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a good witch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”  “But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch. “Oh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West.”  “But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”  “Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.  “She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”  The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?”  “Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.  “Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.”  “Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.  “Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He lives in the City of Emeralds.”  Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.  “What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes.  “She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.  “The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.”  Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:  “I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?”  The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.  “At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it.”  “It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”  “I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”  “The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.”  Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three” in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:  “LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”   The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”  “Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.  “Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.”  “Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.  “It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.”  “Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.  “He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.”  “How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.  “You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”  “Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.  “No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.”  She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.  “The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the Witch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”  The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.  But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.     Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow   When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.  Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.  Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.  “They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.  At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.  “I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”  She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.  Finally she picked up her basket.  “Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”  She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.  There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.  She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.  Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.  The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.  Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.  When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”  “Why?” asked the girl.  “Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.”  “My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.  “It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly witch.”  Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.  When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.  She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before.  “How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.  “I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.”  This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.  She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.  Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.  While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.  “Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.  “Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.  “Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”  “I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you do?”  “I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”  “Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.  “No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”  Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.  “Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on the ground. “I feel like a new man.”  Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.  “Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned. “And where are you going?”  “My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”  “Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who is Oz?”  “Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.  “No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all,” he answered sadly.  “Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”  “Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?”  “I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now.”  “That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he continued confidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”  “I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he can for you.”  “Thank you,” he answered gratefully.  They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.  Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.  “Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He never bites.”  “Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He can’t hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can’t get tired. I’ll tell you a secret,” he continued, as he walked along. “There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”  “What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made you?”  “No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lighted match.”     Chapter IV The Road Through the Forest   After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap.  The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.  At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.  “I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my head.”  Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eating her bread.  “Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.  The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.”  “That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is no place like home.”  The Scarecrow sighed.  “Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”  “Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child.  The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:  “My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’  “‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.  “‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which was true enough.  “‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world.  “‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’  “‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.  “‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He looks just like a man.’  “‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone.  “I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them. But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said:  “‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.  “I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’  “After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”  “I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have them.”  “Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”  “Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow.  There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.  “If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.”  “Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.  “Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”  After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.  “If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.”  Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.  “I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs and branches. Shall we go there?”  “Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”  So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.     Chapter V The Rescue of the Tin Woodman   When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and looked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for her.  “We must go and search for water,” she said to him.  “Why do you want water?” he asked.  “To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat.”  “It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”  They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.  When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.  “What was that?” she asked timidly.  “I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”  Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.  One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.  Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.  “Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.  “Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”  “What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.  “Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”  Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”  “Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.  “Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.  The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.  “This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it down at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more.”  So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful.  “I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said; “so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?”  “We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she answered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”  “Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.  “I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head,” she replied.  The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:  “Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”  “Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains.”  “True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”  “Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick.  The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket. “For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly.”  It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.  Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.  “Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.  “I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. “My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains.”  “Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.”  “Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.  “No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart.”  “And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.  “I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”  So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story:  “I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.  “There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.  “This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.  “I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.  “My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”  Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.  “All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.”  “I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”  Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.  What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.     Chapter VI The Cowardly Lion   All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.  There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side, and did not even bark in return.  “How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we are out of the forest?”  “I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that will protect you from harm.”  “But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect him?”  “We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin Woodman.  Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.  Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:  “Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”  “I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.  “No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a big coward.”  “I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. “I’ve always known it. But how can I help it?”  “I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!”  “Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.  “Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry.  “That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion. “It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?”  “No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up again.  “That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion. “When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?”  “He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.  “Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.  “Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.  “Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me,” continued the Lion sadly.  “What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.  “It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”  “But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said the Scarecrow.  “I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”  “Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.  “It may be,” said the Lion.  “If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease.”  “Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not be a coward.”  “Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.  “I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.  “I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”  “And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.  “And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added Dorothy.  “Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.  “Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.  “Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.  “Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.  “Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”  “You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”  “They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”  So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.  During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.  “This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”  Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.  “You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”     Chapter VII The Journey to the Great Oz   They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.  “If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.”  “Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”  But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.  When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.  This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.  “What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.  “I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.  But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are.”  “I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.  “Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.”  “Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”  “I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”  “I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we will make the attempt.”  The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down.  “Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.  “Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.  Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand. The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.  They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.  “What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.  “They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.”  “I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy. “They must be dreadful beasts.”  The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it.  So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said:  “Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily.”  “That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”  The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.  They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.  “They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.  “Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”  So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.  But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:  “We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive.”  “Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.  “Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”  “Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”  This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on the Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.  “How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.  “That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”  So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.  But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.     Chapter VIII The Deadly Poppy Field   Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.  To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.  They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.  “This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”  “And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.  “And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.  “And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.  “And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.  “We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.  “Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.  Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.  “I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought. “Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!”  Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind. Then the Lion said:  “Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail.”  So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s long pole and helped push the raft to the land.  They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.  “What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.  “We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.  “The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again,” remarked the Lion.  So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.  They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out: “Look!”  Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.  “What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.  The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water’s edge.  “Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.  “I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”  “This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.  “I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again.”  “Where is he?” asked the Stork.  “Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.  “If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the Stork.  “He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much.”  “Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”  So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.  When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.  “I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said, “but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”  “That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them. “I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you.”  “Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.  They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.  “Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers.  “I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains, I shall probably like them better.”  “If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.  “I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”  They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.  But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.  “We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,” he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.  “What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.  “If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The smell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already.”  It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers.  “Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”  So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In a moment he was out of sight.  “Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.  On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them.  “We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”  “I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.”  They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.     Chapter IX The Queen of the Field Mice   “We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.”  The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.  So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.  The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:  “Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”  “Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman. “I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”  “Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”  “Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.  “Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life,” added the Queen.  At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed:  “Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.  “This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.”  “We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.  But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt you.”  At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not bite us?”  “I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”  One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, although he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest mice spoke.  “Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the life of our Queen?”  “Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”  “A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all up.”  “Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”  “Really?” asked the Mouse.  “He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness.”  “Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”  “Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you?”  “Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.  “Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string.”  The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible.  “Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”  So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.  They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:  “Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”  Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she became quite friendly with the little girl.  The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.  After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.  At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.  Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued.  Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.  “If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”  “Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.  After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.     Chapter X The Guardian of the Gate   It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.  “I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”  Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:  “I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?”  “We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”  So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.  The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.  “This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.”  “Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”  “I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.”  So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.  A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”  “We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.”  “Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.  “Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.”  “Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep.”  So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:  “Where are you all going?”  “To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”  “Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”  “Why not?” she replied.  “Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”  “Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.  “Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”  “What is he like?” asked the girl.  “That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”  “That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”  “Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.  “I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.  “Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more brains than he needs.”  “And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.  “That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”  “And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.  “Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man, “which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you some.”  “And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.  “Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.  “I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and I’m sure it’s somewhere.”  “Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.  The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.  The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.  The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.  “That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.  As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.  In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.  There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.  Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.  When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish in the Emerald City?”  “We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.  The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.  “It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said, shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”  “But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the Scarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard.”  “So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.”  “Why?” asked Dorothy.  “Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”  He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.  Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.  Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.     Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz   Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.  There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.  There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.  The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.  “Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they demand to see the Great Oz.”  “Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to him.”  So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely:  “Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.”  They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, he came back, Dorothy asked:  “Have you seen Oz?”  “Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey.”  “Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”  The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”  So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.  In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.  “Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow morning.”  She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.  The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.  First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered:  “Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”  “Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”  “Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.”  Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”  She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.  But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.  As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say:  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”  It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:  “I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”  The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice:  “Where did you get the silver shoes?”  “I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on her and killed her,” she replied.  “Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.  “That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.  Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth. Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”  “Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she answered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long.”  The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.  “Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.  “Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl.”  “But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said Oz.  “That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”  “Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.”  “What must I do?” asked the girl.  “Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.  “But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.  “You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas—but not before.”  The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would.  “I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”  “I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”  Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her. “There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can never do.”  Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.  The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said:  “Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”  So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.  When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”  Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.  “I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.”  “Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.  “Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,” answered the Scarecrow.  “I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”  “I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in surprise.  “So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire.”  The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.  “All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman.”  On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said:  “Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”  So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted.”  But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was one great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”  “I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”  “Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.  “Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the Woodman.  Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it.”  “How?” asked the Woodman.  “Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast. “When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”  So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said:  “If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well.”  The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.  The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.  Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it spoke:  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”  And the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me.”  “Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.  “Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request,” answered the Lion.  The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”  The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.  “What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.  “There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her.”  “But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.  “Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.  “And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.  “And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.  “And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy, beginning to cry.  “Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it.”  So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”  “I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,” said the Lion.  “I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.”  “I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman; “but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”  Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with a green ribbon.  They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.     Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch   The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.  “Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.  “There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No one ever wishes to go that way.”  “How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.  “That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves.”  “Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”  “Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”  They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress.  The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled.  In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.  Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.  At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.  “Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”  “Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the wolves.  “No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces.”  “Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others.  It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.  “This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet them as they come.”  He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.  Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It was a good fight, friend.”  They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.  Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.  Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to darken the sky.  And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”  The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.  But the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.”  So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:  “It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”  The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.  When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle.  Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her.  “Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow had decided what to do.  “Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.” This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.  The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.  Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever. So they started upon their journey once more.  The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.  The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.  When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act.  There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.  So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:  “Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”  Next she stood upon her right foot and said:  “Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”  After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:  “Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”  Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.  One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew close to the Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last time. What do you command?”  “Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”  “Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking.  Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.  Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.  The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch’s castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not escape.  But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her.  “We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there.”  So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch:  “We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”  Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.  The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at Dorothy’s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:  “Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow.”  Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.  Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.  With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.  “If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through the bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish.”  So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?”  And the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will bite you.”  The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.  The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.  Dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.  Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.  But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.  The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.  The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”  “I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not yours.”  “You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take my shoe from me.”  “I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”  This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot.  Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.  “See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt away.”  “I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.  “Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice.  “Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”  “Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look out—here I go!”  With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.     Chapter XIII The Rescue   The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves.  There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing.  “If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,” said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”  “Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously.  “We can try,” answered the Lion.  So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.  The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:  “Are any of your people tinsmiths?”  “Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.  “Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”  The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.  When, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried.  “If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I should be quite happy.”  “We must try to find him,” said the girl.  So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.  It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”  Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver.  As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.  Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.  Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable.  But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back to Oz, and claim his promise.”  “Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my heart.”  “And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.  “And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.  “And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her hands. “Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”  This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.  Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.  Dorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.  Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.     Chapter XIV The Winged Monkeys   You will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.  The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going.  “If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime come to some place.”  But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.  “We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”  “Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey.”  “You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven’t the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”  Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.  “Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City.”  “To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Why didn’t we think of that before?”  Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:  “What can I do for my friends?”  “We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?”  “Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy’s Golden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour.”  “I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise. “What is it?”  “It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice. “But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”  “Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.  “Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.  Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.  “Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.  “What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.  “Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot.  “Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.  “Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.  The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your command?”  “We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost our way.”  “We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her. Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.  The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.  Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her.  “Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.  “That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish.”  “I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.  “Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.  “There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.  “My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.  “‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.  “The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.”  “And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.  “Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey, “he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.  “This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.”  As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.  “That was a good ride,” said the little girl.  “Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion. “How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”     Chapter XV The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible   The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.  “What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.  “Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.  “But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”  “We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.  “And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.  “She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the Scarecrow.  “Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man. “Who melted her?”  “It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.  “Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her.  Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.  The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.  The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.  The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.  Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.  Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.  Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said:  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?”  They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked, “Where are you?”  “I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said:  “We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”  “What promise?” asked Oz.  “You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed,” said the girl.  “And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.  “And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.  “And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.  “Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.  “Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of water.”  “Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.”  “You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman angrily.  “We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.  “You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.  The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, “Who are you?”  “I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a trembling voice. “But don’t strike me—please don’t—and I’ll do anything you want me to.”  Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.  “I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.  “And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.  “And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.  “And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.  “No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly. “I have been making believe.”  “Making believe!” cried Dorothy. “Are you not a Great Wizard?”  “Hush, my dear,” he said. “Don’t speak so loud, or you will be overheard—and I should be ruined. I’m supposed to be a Great Wizard.”  “And aren’t you?” she asked.  “Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”  “You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; “you’re a humbug.”  “Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him. “I am a humbug.”  “But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman. “How shall I ever get my heart?”  “Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.  “Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve.  “My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being found out.”  “Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked Dorothy.  “No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz. “I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”  “But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment. “How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?”  “That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz. “Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it.”  He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.  “This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz. “I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.”  “But how about the voice?” she inquired.  “Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man. “I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.  “Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug.”  “I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully; “but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story.”  So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.  “I was born in Omaha—”  “Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.  “No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her sadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continued Oz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”  “What is that?” asked Dorothy.  “A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.  “Oh,” she said, “I know.”  “Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country.  “It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.  “Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”  “But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.  “No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.  “One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”  “I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.  “Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a very bad Wizard, I must admit.”  “Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.  “You don’t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn’t know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get.”  “That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains.”  The false Wizard looked at him carefully.  “Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself.”  “Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow. “I’ll find a way to use them, never fear!”  “But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.  “You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All you need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”  “Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said the Lion. “I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid.”  “Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied Oz.  “How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.  “Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.”  “That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman. “For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart.”  “Very well,” answered Oz meekly. “Come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer.”  “And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to Kansas?”  “We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man. “Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to find a way to carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return for my help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug.”  They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and Terrible Humbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.     Chapter XVI The Magic Art of the Great Humbug   Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:  “Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I return I shall be as other men are.”  “I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.  “It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.  “Come in,” said Oz.  The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought.  “I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.  “Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place.”  “That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again.”  So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.  When he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to him, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains.”  The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.  Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains.  “How do you feel?” she asked.  “I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get used to my brains I shall know everything.”  “Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the Tin Woodman.  “That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.  “Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.  “Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I have come for my heart.”  “Very well,” answered the little man. “But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it won’t hurt you.”  “Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it at all.”  So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust.  “Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.  “It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. “But is it a kind heart?”  “Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’s breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut.  “There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of. I’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn’t be helped.”  “Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman. “I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”  “Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.  Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune.  The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.  “Come in,” said Oz.  “I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room.  “Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”  He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:  “Drink.”  “What is it?” asked the Lion.  “Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.”  The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.  “How do you feel now?” asked Oz.  “Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.  Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. “How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I’m sure I don’t know how it can be done.”     Chapter XVII How the Balloon Was Launched   For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.  Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas.  On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:  “Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country.”  “And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.  “Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven’t the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”  “How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.  “Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man. “You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon.”  “How?” asked Dorothy.  “A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.”  “If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”  “True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost.”  “We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”  “Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”  “I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.  “Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”  So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.  Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.  “But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.  When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight.  Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground.  Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:  “I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”  The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.  “Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away.”  “I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran towards the balloon.  She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her.  “Come back!” she screamed. “I want to go, too!”  “I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket. “Good-bye!”  “Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky.  And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:  “Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us.”  Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.     Chapter XVIII Away to the South   Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.  The Tin Woodman came to her and said:  “Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”  “With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.  The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him. “For,” they said, “there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.” And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.  The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.  “We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’s cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot.”  “I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”  “For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.  “If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,” continued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”  “But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy. “I want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”  “Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.  The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:  “Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?”  “I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully. “It’s just the thing. I’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”  When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her.  “This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl. “What do you wish?”  “I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.  But the Monkey King shook his head.  “That cannot be done,” he said. “We belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there. We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert. Good-bye.”  And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his band.  Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. “I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me.”  “It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.  The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst.  “Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask his advice.”  So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.  “This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross the desert. How can she do so?”  “I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.”  “Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.  “Glinda might,” he suggested.  “Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.  “The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”  “Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.  “The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”  “How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.  “The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”  The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:  “It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”  “You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.  “I have,” said the Scarecrow.  “I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”  “That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of service to her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”  “When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.  “Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.  “Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had brains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”  “Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kind to me. But I should like to start as soon as possible.”  “We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”     Chapter XIX Attacked by the Fighting Trees   The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.  “You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come back to us as soon as possible.”  “I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must help Dorothy to get home, first.”  As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:  “I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”  “Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey.  The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time.  “City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown.”  They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.  “Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast.  “He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said the Scarecrow.  “If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the Lion, “he would have been a brave man.”  Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard.  The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed.  In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.  The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.  This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.  “Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.  “Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.  “This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we do?”  “The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey,” remarked the Lion.  “I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.  “Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.  The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.  The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.  “What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.  “I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must climb over the wall.”     Chapter XX The Dainty China Country   While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk. The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.  The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:  “I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”  “Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the Woodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side.”  After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said, “Oh, my!”  “Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.  So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as the Scarecrow had done.  Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him be still.  The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall. When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight.  Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy’s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.  But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.  No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.  “How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.  They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.  “We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,” said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South.”  They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.  Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.  “There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?”  “I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive us.”  But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.  Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.  “We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”  A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.  Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But the china girl cried out:  “Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”  She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said, “Why not?”  “Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, “if I run I may fall down and break myself.”  “But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.  “Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,” replied the Princess.  “I suppose not,” said Dorothy.  “Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady, “who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”  Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.  The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:      “My lady fair,    Why do you stare At poor old Mr. Joker?     You’re quite as stiff     And prim as if You’d eaten up a poker!”   “Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?”  “Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his head.  “Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy. “He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”  “Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you are so beautiful,” she continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won’t you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel? I could carry you in my basket.”  “That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess. “You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.”  “I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed Dorothy. “So I’ll just say good-bye.”  “Good-bye,” replied the Princess.  They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall.  It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.  “That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a church. They are all so brittle!”  “They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow.”     Chapter XXI The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts   After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen.  “This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking around him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”  “It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.  “Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.”  “Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.  “I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them about.”  They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.  When morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.  As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed, saying:  “Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”  “What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.  “We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.”  The Lion thought for a moment.  “Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.  “No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”  “If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.  “We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”  “Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.  “Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his forefoot.  “Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will go at once to fight the monster.”  He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy.  The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.  The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly:  “You need fear your enemy no longer.”  Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.     Chapter XXII The Country of the Quadlings   The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock.  “That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must get over the hill, nevertheless.”  So he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”  “Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.  Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This hill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”  “But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’re going to the country of the Quadlings.”  “But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.  He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward.  As quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”  A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock.  The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill.  Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.  Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.”  “What can we do, then?” she asked.  “Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “You have still the right to command them once more.”  “Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band stood before her.  “What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.  “Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the girl.  “It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings.  “This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy; “so good-bye and good luck to you.”  “Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.  The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.  The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for Toto.  “How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.  “It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife. “Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.”  Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her:  “Why have you come to the South Country?”  “To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Will you take me to her?”  “Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.” They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle. After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once.     Chapter XXIII Glinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy’s Wish   Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints.  When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.  She was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.  “What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.  Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with.  “My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”  Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl.  “Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.”  “Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”  “And I think I shall need their service just those three times,” answered Glinda, smiling.  Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”  “I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”  “By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”  “Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.  “You are unusual,” replied Glinda.  Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country?”  He leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.”  “My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well.”  Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy has returned to her own home, what will become of you?”  “Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there.”  “My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore.”  The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:  “You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas.”  “Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda. “If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country.”  “But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the Scarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s cornfield.”  “And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman. “I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”  “And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”  “This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to go back to Kansas.”  “The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.”  “If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once.”  She threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his big head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.  Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself.  Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying:  “Take me home to Aunt Em!”   Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.  The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.  At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.  “Good gracious!” she cried.  For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one. Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously.  Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.     Chapter XXIV Home Again   Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.  “My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses. “Where in the world did you come from?”  “From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely. “And here is Toto, too. And oh, Aunt Em! I’m so glad to be at home again!”     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ ***  ***** This file should be named 55-0.txt or 55-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:     https://www.gutenberg.org/5/55/  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.  1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org  Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.   \n"
