seems like we've had

a temporary outage
and there may be
some issues
with the internet now as you may know
and remember the internet called
yesterday
and he didn't sound well he sounded slow
so we must keep in mind that he may be
having problems today
that said let me pick up from where i
left off
ds-106
as a tv show
starring me dr oblivion
is in need of some
introduction
some sort of bumper
kind of like you'd see on shows like the
wire
game of thrones
etc
so if anyone out there is interested in
creating
some sort of introduction
to the dr oblivion show i would be
greatly
greatly appreciative
i would do it for i'm a master of all
things media
but at the same time i'm a busy man
reading
and thinking
about the bigger concepts
that's right i'm a concept guy
now
back to the point today
we will be discussing
an essay
in two videos
the essay by gardner campbell
personal cyber infrastructure
and gardner campbell's video that he
delivered at open education in 2009
no more digital faceless
thinking the unthinkable
and more recently
michael washes from knowledgeable to
knowledge able which was delivered here
at the university of mary washington in
may
there have been many responses to these
essays and videos or essay and video
and i read your responses on the
blogosphere
and
i'd like to
call up a few of those responses
discuss a few of those responses
and then hopefully
through skype and i'm not sure if this
came through clearly earlier or if i was
disconnected
but skype is now enabled within the
broadcast
so when and if you call me
via skype
or you call my teaching aid jim groom on
skype and his name is jim groom on skype
we will be able to bring you directly
into the broadcast
and this will allow for some discussion
between you
and dr oblivion
to the comments and reflections on the
pieces we'll start with gardner campbell
and i have a few notes here
one of the interesting
immediate reflections
came from kenzie brooks in her blog
and she brought this idea up about
gardner campbell's
video
no more digital facelifts
she said
one idea
that campbell had
was in quotes finding my unmet friend
that is one of the accomplishments that
i want to make after this five-week
course
and i start with this quote in
particular
thank you kinsey for bringing that to my
attention
because when we think about gardner
campbell's both his video and his essay
we could get bogged down in the
technical
information what is an lms
what is a ple
what do these acronyms mean
well quite quickly an lms is what we
might term a learning management system
often conflated with this idea in this
company blackboard
a ple is a personal learning environment
also termed a personal learning network
now rather than worrying so particularly
about the tools
and these definitions of environments
and technologies
i like that kinsey focuses on this idea
of what they afford
this idea
that gardner brings up quite brilliantly
in his
discussion of no more digital faceless
of meeting that unmet friend
of making a series of connections
that many other environments
and under different conditions that may
not be open
would not be possible
and it's this idea
not of the reality
but of the possibility
of what an open
online network
wherein students
and faculty
manage
control
and think through
their own work
where we have some very powerful
powerful possibilities
gartner campbell's essay
in many ways
is the model
technically
in terms of environment
for how ds-106 imagines it
many of you
who started ds106 in fact started ds106
a week before the class actually started
you've got your own
cpanel web host
your own domain
a series of social networking accounts
from twitter
to youtube to flickr
and all these accounts
in all these different
spaces or shall we say social spaces
in fact taken together and as you infuse
them with ideas and art and life
begin to reflect a part of who you are
begin to reflect what some people say is
a part of what you call your network
you're framing a network out in the open
for far too long the university has
imagined this process of teaching and
learning as an isolated
removed process it's the idea of ds106
not only to make this an open connected
and social process
but to bring you
into a state
of considering
and building upon a digital or online
identity
in that regard
the personal cyber infrastructure
becomes the architecture whereby
you can build
and in many ways articulate technically
a space that you exist within
in the ether
this is powerful
and it's powerful particularly for this
idea of education
one of the problems
as we continue
with a 19th century model of education
well within the 21st century now
is that we are further and further
removing
the process of thinking about these
tools and technologies of control
as critical
citizens
by putting those tools within the hands
of both faculty
students
and i would say even staff
we would hope
that despite potential difficulties and
difficulties that many of you noted
within your blog posts and that it will
address but despite those difficulties
and potentially technical obstacles
that there is a way
whereby
you become more familiar
with these tools
how they operate
and how in many ways they shape the
environment within which we find
ourselves
david gury
brought up a point
it's an interesting point and one that i
want to address in his blog post
david mentioned
that
newspapers magazines journals in general
are undergoing an idea or crisis
and that crisis in many ways is based on
their attempt to do a digital facelift
to take what was in print
and reimagine it
for the online media
now what he notes and when i was a bit
puzzled by
is that in fact universities are
exceptional
they don't necessarily fall in to the
same paradigm as something like a
newspaper and a
magazine but if you think about the
question he's bringing
newspapers journals
magazines
they deliver an argument they deliver
information
they deliver a frame to which we
understand our world when you think
about what universities and colleges do
it's quite similar
they deliver this idea
of information
this question of a transferal of
information but as michael wesch notes
in his video
when information is as abundant
as it is in our moment and never before
has it been this abundant
is the role
of the university
to impart information
or is the role
to help students filter
understand and critique that information
therein
lies a critical difference
and this idea of exceptionality that
david points out with the university
can only be grounded
and justified
if the university understands the
changing nature of information in our
day and age
i think gardner campbell
to get back to his point
is making the case
that they haven't changed that like the
universe like the newspaper
or the journal or the magazine
they've attempted to do a digital
facelift for the online
they pretended to
graft
what works in the physical environment
on top of the
virtual environment
and therein
lies some of the problems
now andrew whitfield in his blog notes
well let me go before andrew
let me talk to teddy roosevelt whose
name i very much appreciate
teddy roosevelt says the following in
his post
by exposing only those who are willing
and interested
the infrastructure is able to grow and
support itself
referring to the cyber infrastructure of
and potentially and hopefully
thrive
maybe eventually being introduced to the
entire student body
and members who are already active
to help lead the way and employ a sense
of cool in quotes
that is necessary to invoke
any legitimate interest
especially when it comes to college kids
teddy roosevelt
was a little bit skeptical as many
students out there were and i hope this
is part of our conversation as you call
in via skype
we're a little bit skeptical
about the idea
this cyber infrastructure this personal
cyber infrastructure would ever take
hold
whether it would ever be possible
and there were these questions that
maybe you could do it for a class like
we're seeing here in ds106
or for a select few classes but how
could this be used across the university
how could this be used as a space for
several
classes
well one immediate reaction i have to
is how can we not think of a digital
space that you control and maintain
online
wouldn't be an archive of all the work
you've done as a student
as a space where you could manage
control and preserve your work
for me that seems obvious whether or not
the professor is using these tools
the other question
and this is a good question
is this idea of cool
how does a system
how does a framework for technology at a
university
be understood in terms of cool
well the cool factor is a
difficult one to measure and to control
i understand that
but at the same time
i think by
encouraging
this space
and by employing
the idea
you need
to work through
a space that's yours
and understand that this space is
something that will frame
who you are as a student
as a scholar
is something that can be encouraged
but something that can never be in some
ways mandated
if you think about the university of
mary washington
you think about what they've done with
their blogging system
one of the things
that has made it
by some degree successful
is that it was never a mandated system
it was a system that faculty chose to
use or not to choose now students may
feel differently about that some of them
may have from class to pla class been
mandated to use that system
but at the same time this question of
cool is an interesting one
that is brought up by teddy roosevelt
and it's one that i think ds-106 is
trying to impart
this idea that this space need not only
be
a dry
fluorescent lighted
room
like the lms
but can be something that you infuse
with a piece of who you are
and what you represent
and what you stand for
this question of identity
has come up again and again
in your responses
to both the essay and the videos so we
will address that but before we do i
want to get to a point made by andrew
whitfield
in his post
and i quote
new age of education
is programmed for discovery
rather than instruction
and that's
andrew
quoting directly from gardner campbell's
discussion
of no more digital facelifts
let me repeat that
the new age of education
excuse me one minute
of discovery
as opposed to instruction
places both the student
and the professor
in a profoundly different role
than what we're used to
this role
would ask the student
to become an active
engaged learner
where they take control
of what they're thinking
of what they're exploring and they make
it relevant
to a topic for a particular class
at the same time it will require a
faculty member in many ways to let go
of certain ideas
of expertise
of
how do we say
coverage
and the idea that you're becoming
a reference point
you're becoming a guide a mentor
along the lines
of discovery and exploration
and you both encourage
and infuse that process
with some kind of
passion
for what's going on and the same would
be expected of the students
what we have now in some ways
is an understanding of transferal
you come you pay your money to get a
certain thing
and whether that thing is a certain bit
of information to get you through the
test
or an actual credential so that you make
money
in many ways is a sign of the
bankrupting
of the passion and the system
as it is
let's face it
universities long ago
have become
not so much
a
space
for true deep scholarship and rigor
they become a space
for creating the next
class
of the professional worker
and that is something we need to balance
particularly as the money for these
universities becomes increasingly
increasingly
inflated and expensive
but let me get on to this point
andrew goes on to say the main reason
that i like this quote so much
and that quote again was discovery
versus instruction
because with all the new types of
communication
and information
that is becoming available for everyone
around the world it really allows for
students to go off on their own
to learn and to discover
all of these new topics
and put as much enjoyment
and passion into it as they want
now my question to andrew
and to anyone out there
is how many of you find yourself in a
class on a regular basis at the
university level
where you can do just what he says
you can
go off and learn and discover
on topics
that you enjoy
and put as much passion as you like
i would ask is this the norm
or is this the exception
and if the latter
why
it's an excellent point that andrew
brings to light
and my question for it would be
are we in many ways cultivating
this approach to education right now
chelsea
has another point about gardner
campbell's point
and we do have a question from the live
chat so i'll take a moment to address
that question
this is from tech savvy ed tech savvied
thank you for joining us today
so
if umw blogs was successful because
individuals could choose or not
does that make all forms of media
publishing successful based on the
individual
this is a very interesting question
and it brings up what i think
is a very problematic idea of the
versus the reflection of that individual
through a community
let me explain to you what i say because
this is a point that's going to come up
as i get to more of the students points
in their posts
if an individual believes
that umw blogs for example
is the way to go
because that's a particular way to
approach teaching and learning and
you're of course going to have a few
individuals who want an alternative to
something like an lms
you could have a beginning a starting
point
and those individuals in many ways don't
act alone
they act in relationship to a group like
the division of teaching and learning
technologies at umw
other faculty who they've talked to
so what you have is maybe a series of
inspired individuals who get excited
i think what makes it successful
tech savvy ed
is a series of excellent examples
that people have done and demonstrated
its power
at that point those what we might call
front runners
outliers however you want to define them
they begin to create
a model that other people can see the
value of and join on
now those individuals who ultimately
make the
decision to join on that process
we understand them the same way of the
or are they kind of framed by the
practice of others
i think the idea of the individual
and the space for the individual is a
powerful one
but one of my fears of it and one of the
dangers of it
is it pretends that what we're arguing
for
is this kind of isolation and alienation
of the individual it's kind of holding
up of just a few great individuals who
are changing everything
and i'm not sure that's the case
that's something
i'd like to think more about
i do think that these things happen
communally
right or at least culturally
and there are a few people who might
reflect that
at its deepest
but in many ways
many of us
as a culture are having to deal with
these shifts
right and it's reflected in all parts of
our culture whether it be popular music
movies
video games
everywhere around us those narratives of
the shift are working themselves out
right now
so to put it in one individual
in many ways might reduce it
to a theory of history that often
creates the great man or woman
when i think this is a cultural issue we
all need to deal with
on an individual
level in relationship
to the world outside of us and that
we'll get to some of the points about
identity that come up shortly thank you
for your question tech savvy ad
now chelsea
in her blog post
talks about gardner campbell
in his lecture
no digital facelifts
and sa a personal cyber infrastructure
gardner campbell acknowledges
the issues present in the classroom and
argues doing away with outdated
technology will remedy the problem
although
we'll see if that's exactly what he
noted i feel as though campbell's
proposal is unrealistic this was a
common feeling among students
and too far to the other extreme
to be effective
the current classroom structure is too
much of a contrast to an environment
that is entirely web based
although it may seem appropriate
considering our technological dependence
i don't think the world is ready for
such a change
to my understanding the cyber
infrastructure campbell refers to
in his essay can be compared to the
various identities we have established
for this course
although having a course entirely online
works in this situation i don't think
this method would work with every course
thank you for your thoughtful comment
and i don't
necessarily think
that we need say every course should be
either face to face or online
and i'm not exactly sure that's what
gardner campbell was arguing
either in his essay
or in his presentation
what i would suggest he was arguing is
that every student and faculty member
should have some virtual space that they
both control and maintain
as both an archive it's both of a space
of collective expression
and as a space for networking with
others online
now more and more whether we like it or
not
i think we are going to see the
classroom experience at least begin
experimenting with the virtual space
and part of the process of ds-106
is to imagine what the limits of those
experimentation are
and i think one of the problems of the
lms
that gardner campbell
is reacting so strongly to
is
the lms becomes a predetermined
environment
wherein
the exchange logic of education is
reflected within the very code and
architecture of the space
thereby the spaces in many ways shape
the experience
i believe that gardner campbell is so
passionate about the idea of giving
students and faculty their own space
because in many ways this may be one way
out of what has become the dominant
and some might say hegemonic logic of
the learning management system
to control the space with which in we
learn
and by extension when you control the
you control the experience
and by controlling the experience
you in many ways shape
the education process through the
technology
by imagining new ways
by exploring new possibilities
even if they may seem radical as for
many they many of you they did
they still open up a possibility and an
opportunity
excuse me
thank you very much chelsea for that
thoughtful comment and i hope i
addressed it
in some ways now we have another
question from the live chat
so let me take a moment to answer that
first i'll ask it then i'll answer it
cheryl colin
thank you for your question and here it
dealing with shifts culture etc
wesh never would have gotten so far with
his ideas
had he not let his students help him get
there
this is a wonderful comment
and i would only say absolutely
the fact that michael wesch worked
together with his students to not only
create the videos but to reimagine his
and he asked for their trust and
participation
in many ways changed that dynamic of
exchange
it did not become the professor gives
you something and you become the
receptacle
of that kind of sacrosanct
rather
you become part of the process of
building and developing the experience
the resource and the relationships
so i couldn't agree with you more cheryl
and we will get to wesh in more detail
shortly thank you for your comment
shaina moreland
speaking again about gardner campbell's
essay says the following
i especially loved
gardner campbell suggesting about the
increased advancements in technology
that they not only prove a new way of
education
they also provide the student with more
freedom and more power
over the way they learn
and this
is the idealistic hope
but it depends upon students
who want to be empowered
and who want to take more control over
the way they learn
is the problem
that is potentially the solution
and we have to understand that we are in
a system
whether it be through k through 12 and i
would argue now most of the universities
where
less and less empowerment
for students
to kind of frame shape
and explore the way they learn
is at their disposal
more and more
we have standards of learning we have
predefined ideas of what one does need
to know and how they need to know it
and in many ways do those standards get
in the way of this idea
that shayna brings up a freedom and
power for the student
that's a question i'll throw back to you
it's an interesting one in many ways
it's at the heart
of both of these gentlemen's arguments
empowering students
in an age where the media and the
information affords that empowerment
like never before
katie sterling
another member of ds106
ask the following
or suggest the following
students become more open to the world
themselves the more they are able to
identify themselves and put themselves
out there
the internet allows them to create their
identity and show it to others
this is an interesting point
in this idea
of creating one's identity
and it's a point i'll come back to in a
little bit
but this idea of framing shaping who one
how one experiences the world
through a medium whereby you may never
meet
physically the other person
that allows for people to do fakery
it allows for potentially people to
pretend to be someone they are not
it affords the space an opportunity
to think about how other people see you
even if physically they don't see you
and what that might mean
it allows us to not only think about the
medium but to become part and parcel of
that medium through which we communicate
this brings me to one of the first
points that someone raised about michael
wesh's video
and this comes from
kinsey brooks
she says this and for her
it was a
how do i say it a groundbreaking moment
kinsey brooks says
identity is what is reflected back to
you and after that she notes she always
thought identity was something that was
essential to the individual right your
identity is something that was whole
it's not something that was determined
by
the features and people and reactions
around you
and this question that michael wesch
raises it's very powerful and
interesting question that your identity
is reflected back to you
to the people around you was quite
powerfully brought home
when he talked about his experience in
new guinea
and he talked about how his identity and
how he had defined himself
as a westerner
more particularly as
an american
had changed dramatically over his course
of study in new guinea and how the
environment and how the people around
them
changed his sense of who they are
and who he was
well how could that be any different
than us framing and thinking and shaping
our sense of identity as we move into
what might be considered
a completely different world
a virtual world
a world where we have to even be more
self-aware
a world where we have to be even more
cautious in some ways
about how we frame who we are
this is a very interesting point and it
gets right in my mind to the heart
michael wesh's
understanding of why media
and students creation consideration and
critiquing of media
is so crucial in our moment
david gury brings up another point from
michael wesh's video he says
michael wesch brings up an excellent
point about modern education it's aimed
to make people knowledgeable
getting to the whole
title of this talk
but that's no longer what really matters
knowledge that is information
is everywhere now
and what's important
is not so much obtaining it
but learning how to filter it
wesh brings up some excellent points
about the implication this has for
today's learning environment
and this is a point we discussed earlier
when we were talking about
the journals and magazines and
newspapers versus the university
and so if the university's main mission
of imparting information
is no longer what's necessary
given the moment we live in
then this process of filtering
of helping students critique and
understand that information is what
becomes its mission
and the fact is is that we live in a
media landscape right now that is
dominated as much by text as it is by
images audio and video
and one of the questions at the heart of
ds106
is how do we in this particular
think about our learning environments
differently
this is a large question
this is one that we have to wrestle with
but i do believe that this question of
being knowledgeable of being able to
filter to critique
and consider the information that we do
get on on the internet is extremely
important in this day and age and once
again one of david one of michael wesh's
very powerful points
exe herrera says the following
what hit me the most
was the discussion about identity this
question of identity comes up again and
again both in gardner campbell's
discussion as well as in michael wesh's
when he spoke about his experience in
it made me realize that media is part of
my identity
whether i like it or not
it forms and continues to bond people
with one another
in forms that people perceive to be
their identities
it actually brings up a very powerful
the ways to which media
and the medium
frame
our understanding of not only
relationships but who we are
it is that point of awareness
that understanding
that the media is not simply something
we consume
it is something we internalize
it is something that becomes part and
parcel of who we are and by extension
it is something through that process
that we shape
it is not a unilateral process in either
way
as we often define education as
unilateral as the transaction of
information from one person to the next
in fact it is far more complex
it is a constitutive process
that acts both on the receiver
which reinforces the idea of the process
and reimagines the process take for
example
in our particular moment
a tv show like lost
what was unique about lost
well with the new tools we have
there became a lost a pedia
a wikipedia
like
site dedicated to lost
and this is where fans did intense
research
to think and imagine
what lost was doing where the
inconsistencies in the plot were
how it actually as a show was being
shaped
and what started to happen is those fans
those consumers of the show
started to inform how that show would
develop
which started to question the writers
and started to question their
consistency and there's a lot of
consistency problems and lost believe
you me
well this became a place where the
audience wasn't just passively watching
the show
and i don't think the idea of consuming
is ever a completely passive process
but they had the outlet
to interact
to question to challenge and to many
ways shape the show and the medium
it's interesting
this is more and more going to be the
case as we move forward
and my question would be how is
education harnessing this power
so this question of identity and media
shaping this identity is key thank you
for that point
xc
again back to andrew whitfield who notes
the following
he talks and he referring to michael
wesh about this generation of learners
being tuned out
and when he discusses this with his
he finds that 50 percent of education
school
as a whole
but all of his students like to learn
so how do we how do we understand
the idea that while 50 of his students
do not enjoy school
all of them enjoy learning
where is the discrepancy
where is the disconnect
where is school
failing
to inspire
and to encourage
and to make students passionate about
learning within these institutions
how have the institutions gone about
denaturing
learning
from school
have gone about in many ways making
education about everything but
this is in many ways at the heart
of how school as an institution operates
has the institutionalization
of school
has the attempt to make it more
efficient more tailorized more
streamlined
to serve the ultimate end of
accreditation
to serve the ultimate end
of degrees
in many ways killed its original purpose
as in many ways made it
somewhat
unknowable to itself anymore
has its own identity
been turned to crisis
for it doesn't really know what it
represents
this is a question
and it's one i believe
when i talk
when wish talks about this complete
disconnect between students
learning brings a point that i think we
as professionals
both as professors
and as students
need to think about we need to
understand how do we
create this space and how do we rethink
it for
we could say it won't happen in our
moment
but for many it should have happened
long ago
another point this will be the final
point i bring up from students reactions
to wesh and gardner campbell's essays
before i take skype calls and there are
some questions in a live chat i will get
to shortly
this is from misibu
both these thinkers
are great participants in paulo
ferrari's theory of how education should
do not just bank information into
students heads
i want to thank
misibu for bringing up paolo ferrari i
think para ferrari in many ways
has laid the groundwork
for much of the educational
reform
whether it might be radicalism
another thinker who we could put in
there is ivan illich
and his whole idea of de-schooling
society
these are two thinkers who in many ways
have consistently been critiquing
the educational structure
and the institution for decades
from the 60s through
and frere as you refer to him this abu
is in many ways
suggesting that school as it has been
suggested
is really
about a banking concept of knowledge
the idea of exchange
from one student or from the professor
to the student
the idea of the oracle
and the receptacle
and i do believe miss abu you were right
both
campbell and wesh are reacting to this
model in fact wesh in his talk quite
brilliantly
illuminates the moment where he
understood that he was a dynamic
professor he understood that he could
seduce
his students in some way
to enjoying what he was doing and he
could have gone on like that
but at the same point this idea
of being
professor who's dynamic and passionate
and can communicate well
did not change the nature of the
questions from his students
and it's at this point that he scrapped
what he was doing and he decided to
bring them into the endeavor
that's not only a powerful move on his
poor part but it's also
a moment where he is breaking
directly
as you mentioned ferrara from that point
it's a powerful one
it's well brought up now we do have a
question from the live chat so let me
turn to that now
okay so this is from abby thank you for
commenting abby
and she says
where are instances of communicating
with various pressers professors
what is the way out
and how do you propose
this way with a rapid advancement of
technology now if i'm reading your
question right abby and let me know if
i'm not
of communicating with professors and
various professors has changed
dramatically with technology
and i believe
one of the things that have come up and
i've heard
again and again is that professors are
not prepared to deal with the instant
in many ways dr oblivion through his
technical assistant jim groom
is constantly
communicating with students
in an online environment like this
part of the expectation
in our moment
is that you will have rapid feedback
that you will have instant feedback
that the physical space where you get
that in the classroom
in many ways changes when you move to
the online space
if you're doing a class online
you should have
if not yourself
some mechanism like a gym groom
whereby you can communicate immediately
with students
you can actually
interact with them not simply
in our traditional privilege model of
the face-to-face classroom but also
online whether it be through email
twitter
or a series of other forms
what i'd like to actually communicate
or talk to a little bit is some of the
video responses we've gotten
via
youtube and yet another way to
communicate
both leel zebub and shanotate did a half
hour three set series in response
to the good doctor oblivion
and what they basically argued and
talked about was their reflection upon
wesh
upon the changing nature of education
and through this medium
they became
and given a space to speak
and not only that through the idea of
video as you're experiencing right now
they became embodied in some different
way in some different form
chelsea also experimented with the video
as did tim owens
as did shel cullen
and this idea of the video response is
not something i only want to kind of
applaud but i want to encourage
i think this idea of a voice
right now dr oblivion's voice which
until we go to skype will seem somewhat
unilateral
somewhat monotone
somewhat more of the same
i think we can change this
if you begin to take over the broadcast
if you begin
to interrupt
and interact
and override
any one
sensibility
for dr oblivion
is always already mediated
and you have the same privilege to
mediate your opinions and thoughts
and is up to you to take that
i am going to turn
to the skype calls
i would actually i will be accepting
calls
but in the meantime
there's a couple of things i want to
talk about
until someone
is brave enough
to call oh we have a call
so immediately
we have a call and let's go
let me make sure i have it
okay give me one second
and i will
bring over
okay
and let me try this
excellent
great
abby can you hear me
correct
okay let me see can you still hear me
yes i can
let me there might be a little bit of an
echo
abby can you hear me yes can you hear me
yes okay good okay
and here you are do you have a video
camera you have a video camera yes i do
yes
we got this is it done
yeah give me one second
we got this echo though
i thought i had this figured out
oh great
okay let me try this
all right let's see if this works
okay what's your question abby
well i guess that um
so far what i've gotten from the class
is that oh i'm gonna take this out
because i can't hear you
dr oblivion is having problems
hello hello hello hello yeah yeah
so i see that we keep pushing for
much more virtual communication in the
classroom
however
in classes that i have been where
the only means of communicating with the
teacher is
through the media or through other forms
of technology
there have been so much problems with
maybe language barriers
miscommunication and then
it's just being a little
confusing after meeting the person face
to face
to talk or ask a question
and i know that one of the reasons one
of the things that i realized was
because
i'm african i'm an african and i have an
accent i have an accent and i write
so when i'm not talking to you but i'm
not emailing or i'm talking with you i
may ask a question that may come across
that you may interpret differently
and i feel like we are pushing
for so much more special communication
but we are not doing much to solve these
problems of language barriers and
miscommunication between the center of
the message and the receiver of the
message
so for you
in relationship to both wesh's and
gardner campbell's what are some ways at
that problem
to change the way we communicate through
these virtual spaces
yes and not to make it
not to make it the only source of
communication out there i think that it
should be an alternative to the
face-to-face
communication that we are all like the
traditional forms of communication that
we have right now
so what what would be a way like for
you skyping in
to communicate
you could never see dr oblivin face to
face
but right now we're still mediated
through the camera
and does that still represent some
particular problems
it does i think that this helps a lot
but i'm talking about scenario where i
don't have the option to type with you
where i can only live chat
or i don't even have an internet service
to get through to you
i we we we're pretty much focusing and
pretending that everybody has internet
access
and everybody has the technology called
know-how to communicate through
media
let me ask you this abby
given our moment
when so much of that communication is
being mediated
through the
internet and i would imagine much of
your
courses maybe outside of ds106
don't particularly ask you
to use your computer in the same way to
actually go through live chat twitter
youtube
skype
whatever you have
how can this
in many ways be a space for you to start
exploring
and imagining what it means and the
challenges that are represented by
communicating to this medium because
we can't pretend that this medium is
going away
in fact it's going to more and more
dominate the world in which we live
so part of the experience of this class
in my mind
is for asking you
and all the students out there
to frame a voice
an identity
whereby you can communicate effectively
using these tools now you're right
it does assume
an internet connection
that we are online
how do you
consider that as a challenge
and as a way to kind of work through
that like you would work through trying
to write a paper for your first time
it it's probably a question that i i
would be able to answer more by the end
of the class
but right now i think that i think that
i wouldn't make it the only option out
there for communicating
more avenues of even virtual
communication should be explored
depending on the situation of maybe the
receiver or the sender so to answer your
question i think that i would be very
i'll give you a much more effective or
efficient answer in probably the third
or fourth week of the class
well i have
so much so much more
let me ask you this
with an option of say not writing
a blog post
but responding through a youtube video
that you record
or through becoming into these
daily doctor oblivion lectures
as a commentator
or as a way in many ways to come through
they're much shorter
to speak through
which we're going to be doing shortly
pictures pictures audio audio video
communicate something in a space that's
quite different from we're used to in
the university environment which is
usually the research paper a certain
amount of length
right a literature to review a certain
my question to you would be
where do you think
you want to explore
and build upon a kind of means of
communicating that in many ways we will
not however we frame it
meet face to face
so what tools will you bring that you
know about
to change that mode of communication
that works for you
that to me is one of the great
challenges of this class what i like
about it in relationship to campbell and
is the responsibility now falls back to
you
no one's saying you can't use any tool
the tool you choose
the ones you experiment with
even if they fail
doesn't mean you will fail
it means you've been living to the point
of this class which is exploring
and experimenting with
how you represent
yourself effectively online
that to me is
one of the greatest possibilities this
is an experimentation
you are being asked and encouraged to
experiment
you you're throwing so many hard
questions at me considering i'm not
the most
technological co-adviser out there bed
it sounds like a pretty good thing to me
i would use
i'm pretty happy about the whole idea of
making a video
and maybe blogging
i step that i think that with a whole i
have a problem with a video if i'm
answering your your question correctly
with a video because
there are times when
there's a presence of having
a camera in front of you
even makes you nervous
when i'm blogging
i have my i'm in the comfort of my own
and i can pretty much put everything out
there and i don't have my faith
for the whole world to see
so i feel comfortable knowing that
whatever information i'm putting out
there is not for ya
i'm not trying to watch what i say
because if i should say it in a certain
way people see my face and people might
actually end up commenting on my
appearance in sort of the information
that i'm putting up here
so for me writing login will be like the
best way
to communicate something out there not
necessarily with a video the video can
be some sort of a plus
in addition to what you blog if you have
anything extra to say or if you want to
live chat with people and then ask them
hey what is your take on what i blogged
then the whole idea of the of the video
can come in because for me this is very
different i think that
i i'm i'm learning more about myself by
actually taking this class because we
have to do video chat and then i have to
myself a scene issue for my
personal issues aside and then do it for
steps of the class and by doing that
upgrade
as well
and one of the things you bring up
that i really like abby
and i think gets to the point of this
is at some level
it should ask you and you should ask it
if it is a thing
what it means
to communicate through a medium of
expression
and what that means for us every time
we're communicating arguing to at the
same time consider how that reflects and
builds and imparts upon our identity
i think it's something that we kind of
assume as we go through university
but one of the most powerful most
powerful things about university
is that it's a unique intense
space and time period
that shapes who we are
that is part of the building of an
and i think being reflective about that
process
at a point for a specific period of time
can be very useful
as you move forward
so i would think about the very things
you're talking about do you communicate
better through the text in the blog
what are the challenges for you with
video or communicating through images
or sound
but reflecting on that process
there's no one right way to do it
but there is a kind of intensive
practice a personal and hopefully a peer
network feedback
that can hopefully benefit you
and i'm excited about that because i'm
not putting limitations on you
how you do it
how you imagine it but i'm asking you to
engage it
and to consider it
and reflect upon that process
now jim groom might have different ideas
but dr oblivion
believes that in many ways this is the
kind of point of this class
that makes sense
it does make sense very helpful very
helpful
well thank you abby for calling in you
are our first
official caller
on dr oblivian's tv show
so even though you have problems with
video you do it quite well
thank you thank you all right thank you
abby thank you
and i'm not sure if we have any other
callers
i want to experiment
with
series of
images
julia forsythe had been
experimenting with well actually this is
stella meme
so let me see if i can get this
put me down
okay let's see
so now you should be seeing
the computer screen
and if you notice if you notice
has actually experimented
with an animated gif you've all been
asked to do an animated gif
and many of you did whether your
favorite film or what have you
what i love about what stella meme has
done here
she's taken idea of the personal cyber
infrastructure
and the retinal scan
and kind of expressed
the ideas of gardner campbell
through an animated gif and even gone on
if you look here
to take the very disturbing image
of from brazil
of this facelift
that gardner campbell talks about
and he actually
and she or he or she i'm not sure
brings that image to life
to further reinforce
garner campbell's idea and you'll notice
the blinking blackboard
which is just brilliantly done
and i love this idea of
taking a stand
and expressing an idea about a present
presentation visually
it's a powerful concept and the way she
goes about it
or he goes about it
is very powerful
so the animated gif as actual
interpretive tool for the work we're
doing
very power now
julia forsyth has done something quite
powerful with visualization as well
take a look at this
this is a kind of visual representation
of the ideas
of gardner campbell's talk you'll see
the no digital facelifts image
and there's also the three recursive
practices
curation
narration curation and sharing
the idea of us all being system
administrators of our own lives
right the beautiful music and the
harmony grand harmonies is the sphere
the cyber infrastructure
this idea of a meaningful feedback loop
it's all here
and the cpanel there's a beautiful
representation in a way of kind of
reading the essay visually
and this is important because ds106
will now be moving into
the visual
portion of the class
we're already doing the daily shoots on
a daily basis
the next step now is to start doing some
of the visual assignments in the
repository so we'll be talking about
that shortly the other thing if you
haven't seen it
julia forsyth
has also done
a representation
of michael wesh's
from knowledgeable to knowledgeable
for new media
environments
and you'll notice that there's a whole
series of different images and i would
strongly suggest and when we post the
discussion notes from the session we
will bring this up as one possible way
of thinking about representing
the way you read the way you think and
the experiences you have in this class
is visually
and it's extremely important and i
wanted to highlight this work by julia
forsythe because we're moving in to the
visual portion of this course
i'm going to quickly
take back
shot
i will go back
to dr oblivion
now i'm not sure if we have any more
and on skype
i will check
it does not seem like we do
so with this i will actually
begin to frame
tomorrow
and the rest of the week we are now
ending
tomorrow we'll be ending week one of ds
and this is where the idea
of the students now both creating
from a pool
of assignments that have already been
populated by previous ds-106 students
but also hopefully adding their own
assignments
you'll notice on the ds106 site there's
an assignments tab submit an assignment
within that tab there's a series of
different possibilities visual
assignment design assignment
audio video all of which we'll be
covering
i will shortly be sending out an
assignment
for the
visual portion where i'll be asking all
of the ds 106 students to do a certain
number of visual assignments and also to
submit a visual assignment of their own
creation
and conception
so for the next four to five days
all of us in ds106 will be creating
visual assignments
and we'll be experimenting with the
existing visual assignments to build
upon them there's a very specific way to
both submit
and to tag these assignments so i'll put
out that out in the post which will
accompany this video
and with that i am going to end
day three
of dr oblivion's discussion thank you
abby for calling in and thank you for
all the comments in the blogs that we
got now keep in mind and i want to
reiterate this because it's extremely
important
you need to be reading and commenting on
one another's blogs
as abby said there are many avenues for
communication one of the most important
is the regular reflection
and reading of other people's work and
commenting
please please please do not wait for jim
groom or anyone else to comment on your
work to make it somewhat official
everyone needs to comment on everyone's
else's work we're a part of this
to be commenting is to be engaging and
participating in this class
if you're not commenting in my mind
you're not participating so please
and make the comments thoughtful
good work will only take you so far
and with that i end day three ds-106
